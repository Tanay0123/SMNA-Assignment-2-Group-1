Given the origins of the company, of course they're not going to be inclusive when it comes to darker skin shades, and they should be.

So I went back to the drawing board and i thought maybe a 43N might be for me. That one was too light. 

I need TirTir to expand the ranges between 43 to 51 because God damn, there is a whole demographic of skin tones between those two numbers that are missing. Until then, when it comes to Korean beauty I‚Äôm staying in skincare and maybe and this is a strong maybe, a lip stain.

But I don't fault Jackie for feeling that way on this. It's not my place.

I understand why people might not want to heap praise on someone for a small step in the right direction, and why it isn't reasonable to expect the people most affected to be *able* to, nevermind *willing* (though it would obviously be understandable if they weren't that either).

But it's also true that when you make someone feel good* for doing something, it makes them want to do more of it. It's basically Training 101 for anything smart enough to be trained, including humans. So I also feel like there is something to be said about applauding even the small steps, because that's what will encourage them to take more/bigger steps, and get us closer to where we want to be. 

So that's a tough fucking line for anyone to walk without stumbling, and I'm definitely not telling anyone else how to walk it, y'know? 

It's just something that I see happening a lot with a lot of different issues (some that affect me, some that don't), and it makes me think. Again, I'm not telling anyone else what to think, just talking about my own thoughts.

I do know that of the East Asian beauty brand foundation lines I've seen, this is better than most.

Not good enough, I absolutely agree.  But better than most I've seen, anyway, by not just a little.  I feel like 90% of them have maybe 3-5 shades, but it's definitely possible I just haven't seen the ones with bigger shade ranges before now, so my perception could be totally skewed.

And we're not gonna lie to ourselves, Tirtir had been hitting up exactly and exclusively the western market. They've been all over TikTok for the last 6 months. 

Unfortunately, I'm not optimistic because kbeauty has been about popping up new products on a conveyor belt that disappear just as quickly as they were hyped up for a while now and they don't really aim to have returning clients for their products. So I genuinely do not believe this brand cares, their product for super hyped up, lots of people are gonna buy if and probably many aren't gonna like it but they legit do not count on you being their regular customer for the next 10 years because chances are 2 years from now this cushion will be discontinued. 

I'm an old school Asian Beauty mod, I do speak from experience to an extent. It's all about who will release the most gimmicky hyped up product that will disappear from the shelves not even 2 years after the first appearance only to jump on the next beauty trend. I will be genuinely shocked if a Korean brand comes up with a truly inclusive shade range because times and times again they've shown us it's not a priority for them. And coming out with products that will have a cult following for decades is really not what the Korean market is aiming at and I am kinda mad because all of my faves with excellent ingredients keep getting discontinued for the next gimmick that won't even have a year of longevity with the public.",Ronrinesu,2024-07-22 15:12:56

and this is a company that HAS taken feedback and improved their shade range already. why stop with the feedback now?

the simple truth is, if you‚Äôre launching in a western market, you‚Äôre going to be held to a western standard. if you‚Äôre launching in an eastern market, you‚Äôre gonna be held to an eastern standard. nobody is forcing eastern brands to expand their shade ranges to include dark skinned people if they don‚Äôt want to launch in a market where dark skinned people are extremely present. tbh most eastern brands barely even cover the skin tones of 100% native east asians lmao, them covering darker shades is a pipe dream.",whalesarecool14,2024-07-22 12:18:38

They have a small cafe/showroom in Hongdae, Seoul, where they sell some products, but the reviewers all seem to be non Koreans. There's not many ratings for their products on glowpick, which is a popular Korean beauty app to review products. Their red cushion had less than 50 reviews compared to the thousands brands like Hera had for their cushions. No hate to people who enjoy TirTir, I'm just adding context as to why I think they should expand their ranges. There's lots of Korean brands that do not export their complexion products (i.e. they carry innisfree in sephora in the US but only skincare products).

It is about how Korean culture has made its way into the west in a very big way since the 1980s.

They highlighted fashion, k-pop, movies like Parasite, Squid Game and other K-dramas, and history of technology like phones from Samsung.

Tucked away in the corner there was a smaller part of the exhibition about K-beauty. They had pictures of ads featuring CL and Wonyoung. Maybe G-Dragon.

They had a display about ginseng with these two products in the case. This is serious business in a world-class museum.

I'm glad she's getting recognition for calling out a brand for not being inclusive, that's great! But a few things: a) Why would you beg a brand to be inclusive when clearly they weren't thinking of your demographic in the first place? She even mentions in her original video that the purito cushion foundation has her shade. I'm not saying it's bad to ask for inclusivity, ofc it's her right, esp since they sent her PR of shades that will never match her, but begging a specific brand for inclusivity is just... Idk the word for it but it's so idk how to explain it, but it may have been better to boycott the brand and move on. 

And b) That dark shade on her looks GREY. Idk about everyone else but that foundation did not look good on her because the undertones were clearly grey. A couple of months ago I made a post asking BIPOC about inclusivity and they confirmed that it was hard to find foundations for themselves because even if a brand managed to have their shade, the undertones were almost always way off and that's not inclusivity in the slightest. It could've been her filters or something but that foundation did not look good to me, sorry.

And c) She got a Chanel bag from this whole debacle. Ofc if Mikayla is getting a designer bag, she might as well as she made more of a difference to the brand than Mikayla did. But isn't that bribery? She'll never say anything bad about this brand again because she got an expensive gift from them! Ofc that's not her fault, it's the brand, so why should we support them if they're clearly cutting corners to ensure certain influencers always talk well of them? 

That being said I am happy they've come out with more shades so more people can enjoy them. If you love this brand and you love this foundation, good for you, that's great, but this is only my personal opinion.",Delicious-One3028,2024-06-06 10:33:36

Like, I know a lot of Kbeauty brands just have those very light shades because they work for the Korean market preferences (if they actually match the skin of the people buying them that's a different story). 

And if they are staying there, then sure, don't be inclusive. 

But if they want to expand their market it's idiotic not to expand their shade range. Both because they are limiting their market (especially with how even fair shades have weird undertones that are not favoured outside Korea) and because the optics are bad.",two_lemons,2024-06-07 04:28:45

Just adding here since I'm on the train to get plenty of down votes: Chanel is well known for using sweat shops, doesn't investigate safety reports, is not eco friendly, and actively refuses to admit which parts of their supply chain they actively monitor. This means they use child labor in everything from perfumes (jasmine flowers picked in Egypt) to leather to make their goods. Just because a company has changed hands doesn't mean they are absolved. They made and continue to make vast amounts of money from the name of a woman who helped send people to concentration camps.

BTW for those afraid of oxidation: Highly suggest buying the sample packets before splurging on a full size. They also sell mini sizes for 17N, 21N, and 23N. Unfortunately I believe the oxidation comes with the transferproof formula - it is genuinely transferproof against masks btw - so you have to pick and choose what quality you prefer. For me TirTir will oxidizes but then lightens up, so the final result is about 1/2 a shade darker than my skintone, so it's not too bad on me. I use 23N for both the red and black cushion and its acceptable even though its not perfect.

Overall I accept the longwearing and transferproof quality as that is something I really want in a foundation but if this is not important to you I don't suggest this cushion as it is a little pricey to buy without being able to swatch in person",love-at-third-sight,2024-05-01 07:34:13

It‚Äôs getting better no doubt and even though it‚Äôs 2024 and the global market is literally BEGGING for more undertones, brands need to get their ish together. 2024 even for Asian brands shouldn‚Äôt need extra time to formulate more shades, they have the market research, the money, the customers for it.

To be honest, I did not find it to oxidise much however agree it's warm/yellow toned. 

I think this foundation is suitable to Japan's weather. I wore it for a few weeks in Japan in March - April and it was great. It didn't crease and was mostly transfer proof. 

However when I went back to my home country (more humid), I found the foundation creases around my nose area. Using a cushion applicator seems to help, it doesn't like a makeup brush or sponge. Otherwise, it definitely does not last as much as Double Wear and requires touch up in an 8 hour air conditioned office day. 

Hope this helps someone!",SamStClaire,2024-05-01 12:57:51

HOWEVER. I would say maybe just get it and try for yourself. My skin can, admittedly, be a bit of a nightmare.

I don‚Äôt really want to say my experience will be the same as everyone else‚Äôs, as it may not be. It‚Äôs just my own experience. However one thing to be aware is the foundation does oxidise a lot so if you‚Äôre pale like I am, you may struggle.

Inclusivity is important but let's stop with kneejerk reactions and give Korean brands time to expand their range after they've become known in the west. I'm heavily critical of capitalism, but even I know that not all businesses will survive if they launch a huge range that ends up sitting on shelves. 

Even then, I think there should be some understanding that not every product is meant for everyone. I'm very fair and some products in East Asia are better suited for me, but people want to start cancelling some of them because not everyone can wear products meant for very fair skin. I wouldn't care if western companies catered to us, but it was a struggle to get fair skin products in drugstores to begin with.... 

But I'm moreso talking about very fair blushes in purple or blue. Sorry but there are lots of blushes that I can't wear without it easily looking overdone on me and I like sometimes being able to pick up blush or eyeshadow, going ham with it and it's impossible to overdo it.",Pankeopi,2024-07-01 01:06:34

Let's give Korean brands some leeway... inclusivity is absolutely important, but let's have some sort of realistic expectations. I don't really like how fellow Americans are so western obsessed about this stuff, either. It's not giving any kind of attempt to understand other countries or their true demographics. 

Even if a company goes viral here, give them time to adjust, most Korean brands can't predict they'll be popular in the west and unless they are it doesn't make sense to launch a huge range based on their demographics.",Pankeopi,2024-07-01 01:15:45

The shade I picked, without trial, looks incredibly light from the cushion and application but after 5 minutes it oxidized to match me exactly. It still does after many hours.

It's really odd how it differs drastically, though. Everyone else is saying the neutral and warm tones are the ones to heavily avoid, but the one I chose is warm and oxidized perfectly üßê.

I've ordered the pink one but it hasn't arrived yet. I was just interested in the differences in coverage and finish with both the pink and the black. 

And yeah, I hate saying user error and all that but I did a tonne of research into cushions before testing some out and you really do just need a thin layer, like one or two light taps into the sponge and then blend that out on the face. Takes a bit longer but the finish is always better. 

That and making sure the base is right.

I also want to add that she's totally lying about her work timeline that she talked about in the 5:19 video as well as that recent ""day in life of a content creator"" video she did with the obnoxious typing for half of the video. 

She claims to get up at 6AM and begins filming at 9AM. I'm sorry, but these are short videos, and even with all the FILTAHHHHS, they shouldn't take that long to edit. So then why has she consistently not been posting until the (mid-late) afternoon in EST? 

It's a small thing, but being as busy as I am and having to plan my life down to very small increments, lying about what her schedule looks like and ""how hard she works"" makes my blood boil.",TheBookishAndTheBard,2024-05-30 18:46:10

And they would say exact what I have to say & talk.
More shocking was amazon reviews, most of the Amazon reviews are fake, don't buy anything from them, they would even ask to review the products & send them screenshot. If you guys notice go to any brands & check comments most of them are written by chatgpt or they look fake & they all are very big brands.

The brands would be famous  Protein powder, cosmetics & many more & I did review for every brand at least for 6 months & I used to get good reach as well.

But one day I felt something bad myself when I saw one product {most of the influencers promoted it}with so many harmful chemicals & I was in shock that how can I do this, I am a human being & how can I promote all this just for some money.

So I left content creation & now I am living a normal  life without Instagram & it's much better atleast I am not harming other people.

klairs toner from wishtrend - contains licorice and other gread ingredients. I was amazed how great this toner worked for me.

freshly squized vitamin drops from wishtrend - 5% vitamin c , centella. the effect is not from vitamin c , but from all the ingredients as a whole. I use it as a serum , not as an active.

using emulsions as daily AM moistureses , instead of my regular gel creams. Currently I use Swanicoco, and waiting for COSRX.


Using lighter face oil - these days I use Goodal camellia water oil instead my regular banilla oil essence and Goodal waterest oil.

Sheet mask ‚Äì I would add Leaders AC dressing mask from Mediu line. It's cheaper than Insolution line (which is also very good), but the Mediu has more acids and to me it works better. But, again, both AC masks are very good.

I also like leaders  PORE-SCALING BLACK AQUA  black mask from step solution line.

My one suggestion would be to add a disclaimer re using spearmint tea. The hormonal imbalance causing acne may be a symptom of an underlying diagnosis that needs proper medical attention, or it could be that acne is the only symptom of that slight hormone imbalance but that disrupting those hormones via spearmint might lead to other problems e.g. menstrual cycle changes. People should speak to their doctor before self-medicating their hormones since they're responsible for a lot more than acne. Or you could [add this blog link](http://www.fanserviced-b.com/skincare-routine-for-hormonal-cystic-acne/) that has disclaimers in it to the list?

When choosing oils or products with oils, go for oils high in linoleic acid, as it's been known to help prevent acne ([source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2936775)), while high-oleic acid oils tend to aggravate it. 

Some common high-linoleic acid oils: grapeseed, hemp seed, sunflower, wheat germ, borage, evening primerose, rosehip.

Some common high-oleic acid oils to *avoid*: almond, macademia, olive, camelia (tea) seed, avocado, most butters (mango, shea, cocoa, avocado, etc.).

The amount of time it must have taken is incredible. I just wanted to add that, a few months ago, I created a post about [things and habits that keep my skin clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4cn3s9/simple_things_and_habits_ive_noticed_that_help/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I am more on the combo/acne side rather than oily/acne side... but the points I made and the comments added to that post are still very relevant and helpful for myself (as I imagine many other ABers who deal with acne). Here's the post:  
>I was just looking over the sub, and although this post might not be totally AB-centric, it involves AB. A little background about me first:    
  
>&nbsp;  

>I got into AB at the beginning of July last year (2015). You might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3bospx/tomorrow_is_july_1st_i_am_making_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link) if you were involved in the community at the time. The point is, my skin likes to be babied. It doesn't like being poked, picked, scratched, rubbed, chafed, or abused. I've had acne since I was 12 years old. Yes, 12. I was still in 7th grade at that time. My acne was mild then, but it has noticeably progressed over the years, and became hormonal during high school (around my junior year, IIRC.) I always thought that using products that would dry my skin out would clear up my acne for good. I abided by Western skincare practices, and used an exfoliating face wash, astringent toner, and light moisturizer, followed by a benzoyl peroxide spot cream. If I didn't have a spot treatment, I would dab rubbing alcohol or tooth paste on my pimples. Did that type of routine work? Yeah, but only for the first week... and then my skin would become terribly dehydrated, flaky, sensitive, and red. I was on my high school swim team, and I would have practice every weekday for about 2 hours. As soon as I got out of the pool, I would reapply my makeup and go home instead of washing my face since I was so embarrassed of my acne. I would frequently sleep in my makeup and wouldn't wash my sheets more than once every two months. I would pick my skin almost daily, and then not wash my face after picking for sometimes hours. Basically, my skincare habits were terrible and unsanitary. I didn't consistently follow my routine, and I slept in my makeup.   
  
>So fast-forward a few years... I'm now in my early twenties and I have a well-established skincare routine that centers around AB and AB practices. The most clearly-defined Asian skincare practice being to keep my skin hydrated, even if it's oily. I follow my routine religiously, and when I don't, I sheet-mask or use an extra amount of my Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream ;) Since sticking with my routine, my acne has significantly cleared up and my skin has become brighter, glow-ier, and smoother.   
   
> &nbsp;  

>**I just wanted to share with the community that I've noticed simple things over the past year or two that have immensely helped keep my skin clear. Here they are (finally):**   
 
>* Do not pick, squeeze, scratch, or dig at your pimples or skin if you can help it    
* Keep track of your progress with picking at your skin with an app; stay accountable for picking    
* If you've got a pimple or whitehead that's about to pop or come out, wash your hands/sanitize them first and then LIGHTLY pop the pimple; immediately put a hydrocolloid bandage on it  
* Keep your sheets (and especially your pillowcase) clean; wash them at least once or twice a month  
* Do you morning skincare routine daily and don't skimp on the sunscreen    
* Don't reapply powder makeup more than once in a day; instead, blot with a tissue or paper towel or toilet paper and then lightly swipe or dab over it with a makeup brush or sponge that has nothing on it to fix the finish  
* If you wear makeup, wash it off nightly and continue with your nightly routine    
* If you *really* can't do your entire routine, at the very least: cleanse with a cleansing water/wipe and put your active or prescription on followed by at least one moisturizer or emulsion  
* Try to be cognizant of your hand placement during the day, and keep your hands away from your face as much as possible, especially if you haven't washed them or used hand sanitizer   
* Research the ingredients in all the products you would like to buy BEFORE you buy them and take note of the ingredients your skin is sensitive to  
* Write down your current routine somewhere and record your skin's progress using pictures, qualitative analysis, or quantitative analysis (by this, I mean count the number of pimples on your face at a point in time and record it) and try to determine whether or not your skin gets better or worse when a new product is introduced or an old product is thrown out  
* Introduce only one new product at once, and use it for at least 2 weeks before introducing another new product (because who am I kidding? Patch-testing takes way too much patience when it comes to acne breakouts... if I breakout after a new non-active product has been introduced, I'll know the product doesn't work for me and I'll stop using it)  
* Be patient with active products and prescription products; they can take weeks or months for your skin to adjust to, depending on their strengths; don't give up if they cause an initial purge or breakout  
* Tailor your day-to-day moisturizing routine depending on how hydrated your skin feels   
* Pay attention to your skin a day or two after using a sheet mask; if it looks like it's bright and clearer than usual, use another sheet mask that week; if it looks dull or the texture feels ""off,"" give your skin a breather and wait until the following week to use another sheet mask (YMMV for this one: I've noticed I get tiny whiteheads if I sheet mask too often in one week)  
* Go to sleep around the same hour consistently and don't mess with your sleep schedule if you can help it; my skin breaks out when I don't have a regular sleeping schedule; try to get the same amount of rest every night (that could be 5 hours of sleep or 8 hours of sleep; just keep it CONSISTENT)  
* Wipe down surfaces your face or hands touch regularly with a sanitizing wipe (phone, car steering wheel, hand sanitizer bottles, desks, laptops or cases, closet doors, handles, bathroom counters, etc.)    
* Use prescription oral medications if your acne is hormonal (e.g. spironolactone, birth control, accutane, etc.)  
* Can't emphasize this enough, but use sunscreen daily if you're going out (even to work or school)  
  
>---     

>Suggestions from other users:    
>
* If you think your acne could be hormonal, make an appointment to see your doctor. Don't be stubborn like I was and needlessly suffer with acne. It has made a huge difference in my skin's texture, softness, and of course clarity. I wish I had started taking spironolactone years ago. (*from u/marmot33*)  
* I would also like to add drinking lots of water, I noticed my skin gets very congested if I'm dehydrated (*from u/feverrayz*)    
* washing sheets/pillowcases: You really should be doing this once a week, especially if you use hair products. So much dirt and oil builds up, not to mention sweat and facial products. My tip: flip your pillow over every night (clean side!) And change it once a week. And get some silk ones! You'll thank yourself when you're old like me. (*from u/misspiemisspoke*)  
* If you're a chronic picker (like me) I'd recommend getting acrylic tips! They might not be for everyone, but I've found being physically unable to pick my skin is the only way I stop. Team no self-restraint over here haha. (*from u/AnthonyJCrawly*)  
* instead of popping, get some lancets from a pharmacy. they're basically teeny scalpels and make a nice clean cut that heals better than the tear of a pop. lancet are about 8$for 100. (*from u/IWankYouWonk*)  
* My tip: Wash your hands well before bed and if you put handcream on make sure that it's not something that will make you break out if you accidentally transfer some of it to your face while sleeping. (*from u/pennypoppet*)  
* Something that I've found that works for me is also exercising. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week now and my skin has been noticeably clearer. It's usually clear, but I would get the occasional pimple. This has not happened since I starting gymming more frequently the last 3 months (*from u/AlphaBaby*)
  
>&nbsp;    

>I probably have more somewhere stored deep in my brain but those are the suggestions that come to mind at the moment. Keep in mind, these are things that I've personally noticed over the last year that have improved my acne. I'm currently 85% clear and am in love with the texture and brightness of my complexion. I still have a little more progress to make with becoming totally clear, but compared to a year ago, my skin is doing fantastic and I couldn't be more grateful to this community and the wonderful source of knowledge its users have been :) All hail the snail!

I use the cleanser, toner, gel lotion and the pink powder spot (topical acne treatment), which contain salicylic acid and are all non-comedogenic. 
I've also been experiencing cystic/underground acne more often than other types of acne and will highly recommend seeing your local Chinese doctor who will prescribe you with TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) in the form of herbs which you can then boil/cook into a bitter tea/soup. It may be very bitter so a good idea to hold your nose and eat Hawthorne flakes afterwards. TCM can be used to relieve the ""heatiness"" in your body, also known as expelling the toxic substances in your body that is causing your acne. I personally found it very effective and will highly recommend to those who have access to a Chinese/Asian doctor - I live in Hong Kong, for those who may wonder. ",[deleted],2016-10-12 15:50:31

This is just anecdotal, of course, not scientific, but when I get a few tiny whiteheads on my chin around my period, the regular Mizon AIO knocks them out in a day or two without the need for a spot treatment or hydrocolloid patch. 

My son had severe eczema as a baby and young toddler that is mostly under control now with CeraVe Hydrating and the CeraVe cream in the pump tub, but he still gets eczema in his elbow and knee creases. Snail healed those right up, so I put that on those places 3-4 times a week now and they stay clear when nothing else has ever worked for those spots -- and we have tried every freakin' lotion and potion under the sun for him.

My husband, on the other hand, cannot handle snail at all. He has some scars from welding along his jawline that have bothered him for years -- I mean bothered in the sense that they itch and are sensitive after he shaves, not bother him from a vanity standpoint. He's tried all kinds of Western scar fading creams and the like with no results. So I figured we'd slap a little snail on them and see if that could help. NOPE. He had huge whiteheads all along his jawline within 2 or 3 days of applying the snail goo, and he's one of those people who maybe had like 2 pimples when he was 16 and has perfect skin even though he does nothing with it other than wash his face and rub on a gentle lotion as an aftershave if he remembers to do it after he shaves. *a pox upon him, I swear!*",[deleted],2016-08-07 19:22:24

Just because its a tea and a plant doesn't mean it doesn't contain active ingredients. ""Natural"" does not mean healthier or safer. It just so happens that a very low level of androgen blockade is necessary to improve most hormonal acne - you can supply this blockade by taking a medication where you can be sure of the dosage, potency, purity, and stability of the product, or you can take an unregulated supplement. I prefer prescribing and taking medications where safety is better established and where dosage is controlled, but that is my preference - I have a bias for evidence-based medicine. When it comes to recommending something to a patient, I rely on strength of evidence. When it comes to making a decision for oneself - well, that's another matter.

I'm thinking about doing a few posts on all the amazing things modern aesthetic dermatology has to offer. It doesn't replace our lovely, ritualistic self-care regimens, but I want to be sure that those of us with serious skin concerns realize we can probably SAVE money in the long run with a few strategic procedures with a dermatologist as opposed to spend years applying creams.

And I will definitely document it here. I know there are a lot of younger people on this sub, and I think it would be helpful for them to see what's possible in the future when their financial situations are more secure and they have more money to spend. I know I thought my situation was hopeless in my 20s because I knew there was no way I could afford the kind of procedures I'd need to get rid of the scarring. 

I will always keep up my skincare routine because it HAS made a big difference for me, and it helps my mental health immensely to take that time for self-care doing something I enjoy, but you won't catch me buying $300 jars of cream because in the long run, there is only so much lotions and potions can do, ya know? 

I know some people probably think it's frivolous and/or ridiculous to spend money on cosmetic procedures, but for me, that's my vice. Some of us choose to drive fancy cars, some of us choose to accumulate an expensive handbag or shoe collection, or whatever -- I choose to spend the money on my skin. :)",[deleted],2016-08-08 16:28:30

I'm sure pegaga can be found in tropika. I don't have scientific journal to back up, but [this is close enough](https://books.google.com.my/books?id=sfgPl-IvduQC&lpg=PA76&ots=CvXk1Hmpr1&dq=daun%20pegaga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false). Since it's in BM, tl;dr version would be it's easy to find, unless your house is IN the water. lol. I'm sure you're not like 100m to the sea. That would be dangerous and...dangerous.

I'm sure we all live in tropical region. There is no absolute way, one specific place is tundra or desert for no reason(s).

I can just say I can't get fresh ***Prunus mume*** if I were living in Japan, but people might disagree. 

Do you not have pasar malam (this varies from one neighbourhood to another) or pasar borong/basah? That would be as rural as a place can be. Asking an ahjumma for centella asiatica instead of pegaga/Â¥©Â§ßÁ¢ó, would only invite hard glare from them to me. haha

I've checked the ingredient in CosDNA, and I found there are many products that uses centella asiatica as its ingredients. Not sure if you have received sponsored/press samples related to it recently, but I am looking forward to read your* 'blog digest' containing that soon :)

I lean towards neutral too and the WnW one is a great match, tho it doesn't 'brighten up' my face as much as my L'oreal True Match (shade Rose Vanilla); this one makes my face all glowy, it has neutral to cool undertones. I love the shade match.

I'm always surprised at Maybelline Fit Me rave reviews, it's my least used product. I feel it doesn't cover my acne nicely, and disappears in a couple of hours..And if I apply it anywhere else, like under-eye area, it pronounces fine lines. I like the Maybelline Age Rewind for general face/under eye coverage cos it is less drying,  but still don't have anything to conceal active pimples.

Yikes, why would they do this?! Indian sales staff got to chill. You'd think Sephora would be different since their US counterpart is better trained.

Miceller water/lotions are AMAZING. I absolutely LOVE Bifesta Cleansing Lotions. It's also low-ph! I use this as my second cleanser after an oil cleanser. DHC Cleansing Oil works really well. They don't dry me out like a lot of cleansers do.

Cleansing is the hardest part to get right for me. But I think the above combo really works, so I'm afraid to change it up much :)

I am absolutely in love with the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence. Also, the Rice overnight pack is actually really good. I've not tried the Honey Ceramide one yet, but I'm loving the Rice pack.

I am not sure how overlapping Dry/Sensitive/OverExfoliation are, because I have dry skin and I find that it's only sensitive when my skin is dehydrated/broken barrier. But I find that my dry skin is mostly happy with anything that moisturises it.

Things I use and I have found that work for me: 

* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. 
* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). 

My favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: 

* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. 
* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. 
* Yves Rocher Nutrive V√©g√©tal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12‚Ç¨ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. 

My favorite sleeping pack is: 

* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. 

Favorite facial oil: 

* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4‚Ç¨ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. 

Toner I am using for a while: 

* Yves Rocher Nutrive V√©g√©tal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8‚Ç¨ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. 

I am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. 

I'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. 

I've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are 

* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream 
* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel
* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel 
* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel 

Favorite sunscreens: 

* Bior√© UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. 
* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun 


Other random things that worked out for me: 

* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. 
* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now.

I can't praise Skin Ceramic enough.

I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. 
  
Also, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and ""whipped"" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  
  
I've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   
  
Anyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   
  
Lastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   
  
ETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.

I plan on doing a separate post for anti aging which again will have some overlap - that type of skin dryness is less about a depleted moisture barrier (which will be associated with sensitivity, redness, etc) than it is a natural decrease in sebum production and hyaluronic acid.

I'd say my skin is normal to dry. I do a pretty good job of keeping on top of moisturizing so it never feels dry, but, it never gets oily except maybe a bit on my nose and that's only if I wear foundation.

I've been using the Hada Labo Gokuyjun Moist Lotion for about a month now and while I'd like to say it's doing something moisture-wise, I'm not all that sure I can tell a difference. I placed an order at Sasa a few weeks ago for sheet masks and ordered the Kikumasamune High Moist and I've only been using it a few days but I can tell an immediate difference in how much more moisture it adds to my skin- I understand what people mean by plump and glowing now. I have no idea why, but it works. And the bottle is HUGE. I'll probably finish the Hada Labo by using it on off days or as a mist or something. I'm only a week in to the High Moist- I could change my mind. But for now, Im liking what it's doing.

I use the CosRx Galactomyces and follow it with a hydrating lotion (Kikumasamune, now). (I think the galactomyces has really brightened my skin, but I wouldn't say it adds to the moisture level- it's definitely helped with making my skin less dull and uneven. ). Then I mix a smear of Scinic Honey AIO and a couple  CosRx Snail Essence together on the top of my hand and apply it to my face like a serum. I don't know why, but they don't work well for me unless I mix them together this way. I'd say this combo provides some decent moisture and really preps my skin for the next cream(s) I'll use after it. In the morning I can sometimes get away with just a layer or Mizon Snail Gel Cream to seal It in, but like you, I don't feel it really provides anything that special for my skin.

I'm going to look into the avocado oil you mention for winter bc I know I'll need to step it up a bit. I have the Banila Co Flower/Honey oil but I don't know that I find it all that special.

Personally I'd say that the Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel sunscreen (which is now discontinued and replaced with the UV Perfect Gel) certainly smells like it has a lot of alcohol in there!  I haven't checked all the sunscreens on the list but I think a lot of what makes some of the sunscreens dry down so well is alcohol, unfortunately. 

Quite a lot of sheet masks have alcohol in them, especially cheaper ones.  I compiled a spreadsheet of AB products and colour coded them in terms of if they contain alcohol or not, so that may be useful to people wanting to avoid alcohol in their products.

I live in Australia, there's no Sephora here so I'm shopping online through a friend who is forwarding my packages for me (bless her perfectly blushed heart).  Coupon codes are my thang, so to speak.  I try to keep my purchases as close to the upper side of $50 as I can to take advantage of the free shipping and maximum samples with maximum codes.

The most frequently updated thread about these codes is over at [Makeup Talk](http://www.makeuptalk.com/t/131177/sephora-active-codes/900).  People update that with whatever they've found at least a couple of times a week.  There is at least one new code released every Friday through facebook so add them to your feed.  

I went through *all* the codes and validated them.  How long they stay valid is entirely dependent on how much stock they have.  As soon as they run out, the code expires.  However!  Often they will restock on the same code.  **Things that expired a month ago will be restocked and the code will re-activate but they won't promote it.**  So if you find something you really like and they run out, write the code down and try it again later.  It might come back to life.

Here are the codes I have right now that aren't already mentioned on this page.

This: 

*Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine*

is Tinosorb S.

The ingredient list as posted by OP and the ingredient lists on both the Sephora US and Soko Glam websites include Tinosorb S. However, Tinosorb S is not approved by the FDA. How is it in a sunscreen being sold by a brick and mortar store in the US?

Are the ingredient lists on the Sephora and Soko Glam pages wrong? Is there a US and non-US version and they just don't realize it? Or are they somehow getting away with it by not reporting Tinosorb S as an active ingredient?",no-thyme,2018-03-05 09:15:58

You might also like the Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel. The two feel very similar, although the Canmake dries down quicker and leaves less of a film, but still leaves a dewy finish. Also the Canmake also doesn't have any fragrance or EOs.",M0j0fl0j0,2018-03-05 14:48:37

Now, I'm not worried about Tinosorb; I've used sunscreens with it. Rather, I am wondering how Tinosorb containing sunscreens are permitted. In the US, unlike most European and Asian countries, sunscreen ingredients are considered OTC drugs....so selling them would be comparable to selling unapproved OTC drugs.

http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/04/new_sunscreens_for_uva_and_uvb_the_fda_has_stalled_on_approving_broad_spectrum.html

You may very well be correct that as long as the ingredients aren't being claimed to act as sunscreens, then they can be included. But it would be a seriously stupid law (not that I'd put it past the bureaucratic process to come up with an idea like that) to say that if xyz isn't proven safe you can't use it for the intended purpose, but it's just fine to include xyz for (necessarily) *no reason whatsoever*...

I can‚Äôt remember what color I have (there were only 3 options when I bought mine) but it is a great match and I love the finish but it‚Äôs more of a special occasion makeup for me.

ultimately if you're curious i think it's probably worth trying just to see; it looks like there's a mini version of the tirtir cushion, so that might be a good option to try it out first. many brands (not sure about tirtir) also offer refills for cushion compacts which saves you a few bucks when it's time to repurchase.",bonertootz,2024-05-25 04:13:30

From what I have tried, Su:m 37 is much better for my skin (51, dry to very dry) than Sulwhasoo.  I'd probably try more of Whoo but it's harder to find here (I'm in NYC) let alone buying samples.

I have used Su:m 37 Eye Cream - Losec Therapy for 4 years and I love it (better than Flawless Eye cream for me).  Would you know how Losec Therapy is different than the Losec Summa Eye Cream?  Are they phasing out Losec Therapy and replacing it with Losec Summa?

I really appreciate your in-depth explanation of the differences between the different lines as it gets confusing.  For skin above 50 (dry to very dry), is the Losec line preferable over the Flawless or vice versa?  I have tried the Secret Repair Eye Cream and the Secret Repair Concentrate Cream Rich and although I loved the texture and scent (gorgeous), I felt the Losec Eye Cream firmed up more so I just use the Secret Repair Eye and Cream Rich as an overlayer for more effective creams I have.

Emulsion:  I was intrigued reading how the Secret Repair Emulsion was so moisturizing but maybe I need the Emulsion or Lotion from Losec or Flawless?  Can you describe the difference?  Thanks!",isabel_in_nyc,2018-02-06 18:24:17

It would be helpful to have some ingredients lists here though, since Su:m37 is very backwards and refuse to post their ingredients list in English anywhere... I can only answer them by refusing to buy their stuff, which is a pity - it was my introductory brand in a sense; I buy some random things from Su:m37 every now and then, but not the whole line like I used to. But if they still want my money, they should do what Sulwhasoo did and get English mirror for their website with full ingredients lists. The History of Whoo is not there yet when it comes to ingredients, but at least they got the website up and running, so they get points for that...

i was talking about that with a sales lady about that and she slammed me with phyto vital samples. the toner has alcohol tho lol. i kinda didn't expect that because you know, plant shit. but it's there. at least ohui ingredient lists are easy to find.

btw, how long does it take you to sample an entire brand? i guess you're getting samples through ebay or something?

+++

So guys, as promised, this is their lineup of makeup products. Sorry I couldn't get it in the main post of all of their other products because they allow 40k characters max which is pretty generous but I exceeded that (wow lol talkative me) So their makeup has many lines and it's easy to be confused, just like how you would with their skincare. Let's get to it!

**1. Cushion:** 3 cushion products and supporting products.
-

* **Perfecting Cushion EX**: The OG cushion from Sulwhasoo that took the beauty blogger world by store got an upgrade in August 2017. The added Schizophyllum Commune extract increase the moisture content to the OG formula with Jaumdan and apricot kernel oil. A few tweaks were made to enhance the durability and wear of this cushion. I love this, it works better than ever. Comes in more shades too: #11, #15, #17, #21, #23, #25, #27, #31, #33 and up to #37. Good bye to this stupid stereotype that Korean cushions ain't diverse.

* **Perfecting Cushion Brightening**: This cushion is more like a CC cushion, meaning it doesn't cover flaws but rather correcting a dull and sallow skin tone. It has Jaumdan and Snowise Complex (white ginseng extract + licorice for brightening) . It contains magnolia extract and arbutin (> 2%) for brighrening. It also has an oil absorbing network and mother of pearl powder for increased luminance. It comes in #11, #13, #17, #21, #23, #25, and #33. It's not enough coverage for me but some others swear by this.

* **Perfecting Cushion Intense:** The highest coverage cushion with the highest moisture level as well. Enriched with Jaumdan, Pearlescent powder, plum blossom extract and Red Pine extract for stronger, more resilient skin. This is basically like a serum-in-cushion since it‚Äôs so hydrating. It comes in a wide range of colors and I love the way the case looks. It comes in a wide array of colors #11, #13, #17, #21, #23, #25 and #33. This is my HG cushion for my dry ass skin along with O Hui's The First Ampoule Cover Cushion. Also available in Lantern Collection version.

___________

**Makeup Balancer**: 
-
A makeup base specifically made to be used with Sulwhasoo cushions. It offers light color correction using the 3 fundamental colors of your skin and providing rich moisture. 

* #1 (Light Pink) is made for dull skin
* #2 (Light Green) is made for acne prone, inflamed, irritated skin with redness, 
* #3 (Light Purple) is for yellow skin tone that needs a whitening boost. The purple pigment neutralizes the yellow shades to reveal bright translucent skin. 

All shades just give a slightly brighter finish, and there's a lot of moisture to this so yess I am enjoying this!!!
____

**Powder For Cushion:** 
-
A powder specifically designed for cushion to absorb oil and help anchor the foundation to the skin. I mean this is fine and you could definitely use something cheaper though.

____
**Multi Cushion Highlighter:**
-
 A customizable highlighter to use before or after cushion, or even after the finishing powder for various degrees of radiance. 

----

**Evenfair:** Makeup for people who want lightweight, no BS makeup. 
-

- **Evenfair Smoothing Foundation:** A moisture rich, silky foundation that gently wraps the skin while providing sufficient coverage.

- **Evenfair Smoothing Powder Foundation:** Can be used on top of the liquid foundation or on it's own with a primer it covers flaws and provides a natural, bright finish. The particles melt into your skin so this isn't even visible on the skin, unlike many other powder foundations.

___
**Lumitouch:** An elevated line of makeup leaning toward the coverage end of the spectrum.
-
+ **Lumitouch Liquid Foundation:** A quick setting foundation that has a semi matte finish. 
+ **Lumitouch Cream Foundation:** A richer, creamier foundation for dry skin types and a dewier finish. Me likey.
+ **Lumitouch Skin Cover:** A creamy foundation-concealer balm. When used right it give an even and bright complexion. When not used right, you‚Äôre gonna be a cakey mess.
+ **Lumitouch Twincake:** Use it on top of the liquid or cream foundation for extra high coverage or use on it's own with a wet or dry puff for normal coverage. The name ‚ÄúTwincake‚Äù is derived from ‚Äútwo way pact‚Äù meaning you can use it both ways, wet or dry You could keep this around for retouching.
+ **Lumitouch Powder:** Adds a luminous finish to your makeup and locks it in. No smudge, no budge, no bullshit. HG finish powder.

___

**Snowise:** Accompanying line for Snowise skincare. 
-
Wait, but what about the Brightening Cushion? I know you'd ask that. You are basically left with two directions. One, do your makeup the lazy way aka cushion. Two, use this line, take a bit longer but have perfect skin because there are some things a cushion just couldn't cover up. You can retouch using the Brightening Cushion, same goes for the Timetreasure line

+ **Snowise Whitening BB Essence:** A lightweight BB serum the brightens skin and has a light, buildable coverage. This shares 47% of the ingredients as the Snowise serum. (This doesn't mean 47% of this product is serum) 
+ **Snowise Whitening UV Pact:** A finishing pact for glowing and hydrated skin. This is my favorite pressed powder :o

___


**Timetreasure:** The accompanying makeup line for Timetreasure skincare.
-
This range offers more hydration, and more coverage vs the Intense Cushion so it's for people with drier skin and more flaws/wrinkles. 

+ Timetreasure Radiance Makeup Base: A base containing color correcting trifecta of jade, coral and gold to correct dull and sallow skin tone. It contains red pine + Jaumdan for extra hydration.

+ Timetreasure Radiance Foundation: A foundation with Timetreasure oil complex that gives skin a natural glow. It also works to cover and actively correct wrinkles around the clock. 

+ Timetreasure Radiance Powder Foundation: For those who prefer a lighter way to do makeup, use this powder for quick brightening. Or use this on top of the liquid foundation to give your skin a perfect smooth texture all day long. You don't use this for retouching, you use the Intense Cushion for that.

___

**Others:** Miscellaneous products you can use to add on
-

+ Complete Care CC Emulsion: This is basically the liquid foundation inside your cushion, but without the actual cushion sponge. I love this product be it contains 53.2% moisturizing ingredients and gives my dry skin a very nice dewy glow in one lazy step.


+ Essential Concealer Stick: A buildable concealer, it minimizes it's use of traditional waxes to maximize fluidity and glide. It covers lightly and does not get your face cakey. It‚Äôs the only concealer I‚Äôve used, maybe the one from Dior that I used like once but that was a year ago so I could conclude that this is HG status or pretty standard for a concealer. I feel like it is pretty good at what it does. #1 (Medium Pink) is effective at concealing dark spots and dull zones, #2 (Medium Beige) is good at concealing blemishes and redness.

+ Radiance Blusher: A tri-colored blush for naturally rosy cheeks, use the lightest color for highlighting, the medium color for a basic blush/eyeshadow, the darkest color for eyeshadow or blend them all together to create a perfectly blended blush color that is only a bit pink and not overdone. #1 (Pink Harmony) is meant for fairer skin tones, adding a rosy glow. #2 (Coral Harmony) is meant for darker skin tones, creating liveliness.

___

**Lip:** Their collection of lip products aren't as diverse as Whoo's but they aren't here to PLAY they're here to STAY. 
-
Intensely hydrating, intensely pigmented, intensely plumping, might I say these lip products set the golden standard for all lip products.

+ Essential Lip Serum Stick: A oil serum condensed in a stick. You heard me. It's left as it is (#1), or it is blended with a tinge of pink (#2) for a nice rosy touch, or if you don't wanna go the subtle way you can just have it mixed with bold, high performance, oil coated pigments (#3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8)  it has an oil blend of safflower and camellia , forming a double layer  of moisture. It also has apricot kernels seed oil and elastic complex to fill in wrinkles. 

+ Essential Lip Care: For extra care prior to the lip serum sticks. These are lip gels that are less occlusive and have more moisturizing/anti wrinkle functionality vs the lip serum sticks. They contain Day Lily, Sea Berry, Shea Butter, Peach Kernel Extract, Tigerlily Extract, Jaumdan in Honey and Ginseng saponins to moisturize and reduce wrinkles. It is a anti wrinkle functional cosmetic. #1 is used at night and #2 in the morning before lip makeup.

___

**Shineclassic:** Their line of limited edition presssed compact powders. 
-
Available once a year and the case design changes annually and is hand crafted by master artisans.

+ **Shineclassic Powder Compact:** A finishing pressed powder inspired by stone grinding techniques. It is a superfine powder texture mixed with a special pigment coated with prunus mume extract and Jaumdan decocted in honey. It is then further enhanced by adding white jade for skin purification and circulation enhancement and coral powder for a dazzling glow. 

+ **Shineclassic Multi Color Compact:** Created using the very same ingredients and principals as the Shineclassic Powder Compact with a bright touch of color. It is comparable to the Radiance Blusher but I feel that it is smoother and more pigmented than the Radiance Blusher. The Radiance Blusher has no refill while Shineclassic has both a main case refill, so the price per blush refill √≠ not much of a difference.

Astro Bot Review Thread,2429,2024-09-05 12:00:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1f9ko75/astro_bot_review_thread/,Games,Question - how is the movement? I feel like the reason games like Super Mario Odyssey are so beloved and have such staying power is the smoothness and versatility of the movement options. If this game is anything like the PSVR one it seems the base movement options are pretty simple and it relies upon constant gimmicks to make the game interesting. Not a bad thing mind you but an important distinction.,mrBreadBird,2024-09-05 13:31:07

What's the level of challenge like? For reference, I tend to love hard but not punishing platformers like SMB and Celeste. I really enjoyed Odyssey but found it a bit too cruise control at times.

I put 600 hours in, and actually enjoyed grinding and went out of my way to do it, when I absolutely hate combat in every other jrpg and usually just use the most op stuff to skip it.

The story was amazing: bombastic, full of turns, takes its time as it should, and it gave Kiryu an appropriate amount of screen time, when I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt. I like Kiryu a lot more than Ichiban. I didn‚Äôt think any story could beat out Lost Judgement for me in the series but it did, handily. 

Plus it‚Äôs the most generous game I‚Äôve ever played. Getting to chapter 8 and realizing there‚Äôs two whole ass more cities, another completion list, another dungeon, another everything? I came from my eyes. And the callbacks to the rest of the series? I legitimately cried over ten times. Kiryu‚Äôs my favorite character of all time man and it‚Äôs not even close. 

I got every trophy in the game and 100%‚Äôd both completion lists, as well as got everyone to level 99 and at least rank 30 in every job. 

I tend to 100% games a lot, but IW was the first game in which I never got tired of it, even after 600 hours. 

It‚Äôs not just GOTY for me, it‚Äôs my game of the century. Truly a 15/10 in every way: story, combat, mini games, game feel, characters (except Tomizawa, I didn‚Äôt like him that much).

Well if you do, you might remember that it started as a game called OVERSTRIKE and followed a team of irreverent mercenaries with a penchant for collateral damage and over the top weapons. After OS was revealed, it went quiet for a few years before being re-revealed as FUSE. FUSE followed the same characters, but gone were their dry remarks and colorful world. Instead it was no-nonsense grimdark co-op shooter where they had to stop stock Russian bad guy Red Commievich from stealing the doomsday weapon.

Insomniac explained the change, saying that during testing they had several age demos play the game and give their thoughts. A common thing they found was 12 year olds saying that it felt like a game ""for babies"" and that it didn't feel like a fun shooter compared to Call of Duty. End result was a generic and painfully average co-op shooter.

Concord was by all accounts a well made game thats got decent gameplay, but launching into an oversaturated genre with no major hook to draw players, and a weird hate campaign undermining its poor marketing. Its a poor idea, and hit the market at the wrong time, but its not exactly a bad game.

SS, despite rocksteady having some great devs, cutting edge visuals and a great hook, feels like a product that was devoid of direction for its long development, resulting in something that didnt really work on a coherent gameplay level.

Concord was developed by Firewalk Atudios, a company that was formed in 2018 and had never released a game before. They had no reputation nor goodwill to destroy.

I feel like Aprilskin was the og cushion. I used 19 or 20 (can‚Äôt remember) and 21 na shades. Gosh that must have been 9-10yrs ago. Haha. Both shades were okay for me but I preferred the 21. Naka 3-4 na empties ako non 21 until I could no longer get my hands on one so I stopped using cushion and sakto din na I stopped working na sa events so I rarely put anything on my face na after that. 

I just bought laneige a couple of months ago. Based sa swatch and recommendations I read online, I got the 17C. It‚Äôs okay pero I prefer a shade darker though seamless naman ang color neto for me (saktong shade lang pala apparently).

Sa local bases, I use First Base Coron, Issy Skin Tint in Spruce, Tirtir 24W. For Romand cushion, I use 25 (Sand), a tiny bit deeper when swatched, but it's light coverage so it blends well naman.

Swatched for you. This may be a bit darker for you if you're fair.

So people were more lenient than they should be, just because the wait was so damn long.

After 135h of playtime i finished 100% of Starfield and even 3 NG+ runs and i agree with the 7/10 score.

Its a good basis and structure of a game, but it feels too empty of content to be on par with Fallout 3, 4 or New Vegas or Skyrim for that matter, all of them had really full maps with lots to do.

Starfield has a lot more systems, but all of them just there and barely used or only clunky to be used.

I don't think the open world style of RDR2 and BOTW would work well here, especially considering how fast you are. BOTW and RDR2 are all about world exploration, but I get where you're coming from and I agree, side activities should be much more fun.

Tears of the Kingdom and Baldurs Gate 3 are obvious. Their critical reception coupled with their audience reception and overall quality just go beyond most other games out there. They each have their issues though, but nothing that seriously compromised the overall quality and hours of fun and adventure you get from them. 

Re4 remake will depend if TGA decides to learn from the negative reaction people had to having Re2 nominated, especially in a crowded year like this one. I think Street Fighter 6 is a good choice because its pretty amazing and open to newcomers, has the return to grace aspect going for it, and is highly rated as well. That coupled with giving Capcom the nod for Re4 without nominating it specifically points to it being likely in my opinion. 

Spider-Man 2 is likely as a Sony rep and given the scores and enthusiasm here coupled with the lofty but met expectations, seems likely as well. 

The final spot gets iffy. My hope is that it's Hi-Fi Rush. I loved that game and as a new IP it blew me away. It also occupies that AAA studio but AA budget space and is an action/rhythm game making it more niche. However, my fear is that it's early release date and limited reception compared to other games here will remove it from this list. I would vastly prefer it over Starfield as well if TGA wants an Xbox rep. 

In the heat: Final Fantasy 16, Diablo 4, and Starfield. All of these could be up there as well but each has been divisive among new and lifelong fans of the series/studios. 

Possible: Mario Wonder. Never count Mario out. 

Unlikely: Jedi Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat 1, Sea of Stars. I personally haven't played those, but from I've seen and read they are pretty good games but closer to 8/10 than 9/10 with each of these games having one major flaw either in story, performance, or roster. Dead space and Metroid Prime remake inhabit this level because I think they run into the same issue as re4 and I think re4 would easily be chosen over them if a remake gets a nod.",thewintersoldieramc,2023-10-17 02:37:01

Yeah I absolutely agree, it was ridiculous how Bethesda got away with that, especially weird considering it was mostly British outlets as well as if we have some sort of vendetta against space travel because we decided if there's no hot & spicy food or Olympic quality athletes to be gained from the trip, what's the point of going?

I dont think its the same in other genres. You can say collecting 3 special coins in a 2D Mario level is a checklist but its not overbearing gigantic task of seemingly infinit time investment that hovers over you and you get reminded of every time you look at the map.

Or going through a linear Uncharted or Tomb Raider game, you just do a bit of side exploration if you want.

I dont think its a problem in open world games like Zelda or Elden Ring because there I have to explore on my own and the game doesnt really track all the collectables so its easier to ignore the things I missed. (shrines & wells in tear of the kingdom went a bit in that problematic direction for me as well, although it helped that those were actual things to do and not just something to collect)",Ghisteslohm,2023-10-16 17:29:39

TLDR: While I do think it's possible, I agree with you. Spider Man can't have an exploration design similar to Breath of the Wild or other games. It just doesn't work. Not with the current designs we have in videogames, at least. Maybe one day in the future.

For example, the main aspect of getting up high and seeing something in the distance that grabs your attention, something Red Dead, Zelda and Elden Ring all did very well, is incredibly limited on an urban setting as New York, since you can see buildings everywhere, and It's not that easy to diferentiate them or the tiny space between one and another. Sound design would be the way to go to help the player in this case, I think, with gunshots in the distance making you want to check things out, as well as a help scream, a police car siren or an explosion.

The problem, however, is to make these things standout in a clear way on a bustling city, which either requires a crazy good sound design or could be solved by a ""witcher sense"" button like in Witcher 3, making Peter hear everything well and show the origin of the sound, however, this sole ""sense mode"" goes against the premise of exploration existant in those other games, and makes it basically another way to tackle a check list, but instead of looking at a map, you're looking at ""Peter 'seeing' the sounds"" so it goes against the main idea.

This is just an example, but there are many other things to consider. Unique encounters take a lot of work... Things need to be well spaced for it to feel like an organically discovered encounter, so the map needs to be pretty large for everything not appear too close from one another, but too big becomes something boring to traverse... Game pacing dictates most of the experience, and exploration isn't something made in fast paced terms, but in slow paced ones (Red Dead, Death Stranding, Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild are incredibly slow paced games), which pretty much goes agaisnt the intense action focus of Spider Man games...

I do think someone might find a good way to tackle this, but in the current game design we have considering other games? Yeah, it definitely does not work at all for Spider Man.",DDM08,2023-10-16 18:28:24

There aren't like an *insane* number of those missions so it doesn't wear itself out so easily (for me at least), most of the missions are pretty quick to do, and the traversal is so inherently fun that every part of the process doesn't feel like a chore to do. 

In a lesser game, things like just getting from point to point wouldn't be nearly as fun so for example I'd look at a mission and have to fast travel to the nearest point and then waste time walking there doing nothing of note and that alone would likely get boring enough after enough missions to make me not want to complete them.

While traversal in Spider-Man was fun, checklist-type open-worlds boil down to the same repetitive novel tasks that lose their entertainment value pretty quickly. The systems in these types of games just aren't complex enough to diversify the activities beyond the basic tasks you're already doing with them. 

Finding the backpacks in the first game was arguably the most interesting of the tasks for me because it made me pause and think about the world--where the backpack might be, how I could get to it, and a skinner box reward of flavor text. Going to breakup a gang hideout 20 hours in just isn't that fun when I've been utilizing the combat systems against the same enemies all game up until that point.",KyledKat,2023-10-16 16:13:09

Which is why overall I think this year is only comparable in single player RPG/action games and nothing else",Abulsaad,2023-10-16 15:40:28

For some, a single 10/10 release might make a year better than five 8/10 releases (or vice versa). Some will look at how the released games shaped the future of gaming history. Some people rate games based on how good they were on their release, not in the context of the current year. Some people will take graphics into account, others won't. Some will only rate games based on their release state, others will include all the fixes in their rating (very important for games like Cyberpunk 2077 for example). Heck, some people will even think about the whole gaming industry and the things that surround it.

What I'm saying basically boils down to - ""best"" is very subjective and means something different for different people. So yes, people will never truly agree as to what the best year is. But the fact that many people already think about 2023 as one of the best years in history means a lot. No one was saying that about the last few years.

Personally, I don't think that ""best games"" and ""most influential games"" are the same thing. 2023 definitely won't be the most influential - many of the best games released this year are sequels and iterations of the already established, successful formulas. It's really hard to be as influential as 30 or even 20 years ago. I still haven't played a lot of the 2023 releases so I won't judge the whole year yet, but from what it looks like, for me, it might be a serious contender for the best year in gaming ever. Maybe my opinion is controversial, but I think that the best games from the present are simply way better than the best games from the past (and I've been gaming since the late 90's).

We've had some standout original indie games (e.g. Dave the Diver) but that's not most of the stuff people are citing when praising this as one of the best years in gaming.

So if we look purely in terms of quantity of extremely high-quality, polished AAA and AA games, this stands out as an incredible year for gaming.  At the same time, I don't think any games will be remembered as hugely influential games that changed the gaming landscape like, say, the games people cite when talking about 1998.  The most likely game from this year to end up being hugely influential is probably Baldur's Gate 3 if it inspires a new wave of popularity for the CRPG genre and more big publishers investing money into polished, AAA CRPGs, but it's still too early to say whether or not that will happen, and even then most of the praise for Baldur's Gate 3 isn't for doing something new, but rather for taking an existing niche genre and getting mainstream attention through the use of an existing IP and just incredible quality.",Quazifuji,2023-10-16 23:03:27

So yes, people will never truly agree as to what the best year is. But the fact that many people already think about 2023 as one of the best years in history means a lot. No one was saying that about the last few years.

Well said. ""Best"" is subjective and everyone has their own criteria. But I don't think it is debatable at this point that 2023 will go down as one of the all time best years in gaming due to both the quality of games at the very top, the depth of high-quality big name games further down the rankings, and the diverse genres of games represented. 

It seems like the period 3-4 years after a new console generation launch is the sweet spot. Developers have had a bunch of time to get used to the new hardware and the install base is high enough to not need to worry about multi-platform games.

2023 is 3 years after the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launches. 2017 was 4 years after PS4 and Xbox 1. 2007 was quicker, just 1 year after the PS3 launch but 2 after the Xbox 360 launch. 1998 was 4 years after the PS1's Japan release and 2 years after the Nintendo 64's Japan + NA release.",SiccSemperTyrannis,2023-10-17 06:23:20

We're also just seeing tons of more games in general as the overall industry grows, which means any individual game is trying to make waves in an ocean compared to a lake.

>seeing as how video games were still niche and nerdy hobby back in the 90s

Why  do you guys keep repeating this revisionist history? I swear one person even said this about pre-COD4 gaming...wtf

The PlayStation 1 sold over 100 million units, 10 less then the PS4, with the original Gameboy outselling both even. Bear in mind how many less billions of people there were in the world 20 years ago too. While yes, the market wasnt *as* big and there are now more accessible venues of playing games like mobile phones and PCs, its fallacious to claim gaming was niche In the 90s. Its been a hit since the getgo. 

Even nerdy is wrong...going to the arcade and playing games all day is one of the most common things 80s kids and teens will get nostalgic over. Biggy Smalls even mentions buying a Sega Genesis in Juicy ffs lmao.

Gaming's become *affordable* over time is what's happened",throwawaylovesCAKE,2023-10-17 00:34:32

* Tesla has been exaggerating the range of its cars, both in advertising and use of deceptive readings on the dash.  
* This has caused thousands of customers per week to initiate service appointments.
* Tesla uses deceptive and heavy handed tactics to try and thwart these service complaints.  They trick customers, cancel their appointments, put flags in the software to block that customer or hide true problems with the vehicle.
* A special Tesla team in Nevada ruthlessly suppresses and stonewalls customer complaints, and celebrates each major deflection of a customer by hitting a musical gong/xylophone.
* Indpendent experts have found varying degrees of inaccuracy or exaggeration in Teslas range claims, far more than any other automaker.
* EPA processes and rules make it hard to hold them accountable.
* Korea is the only place that has really made them accountable, forcing Tesla and Musk himself to make a public admission of their deceitful conduct.
* Some owners and drivers don't understand the things that can affect range, such as driving style and conditions and weather, and use of heating or air conditioning.
* Tesla owners feel the range is exaggerated by as much as double.  Experts have found it is overstated by more like 5-15%.",MissDiem,2023-07-27 18:42:35

I just completed an almost 1600 mile round trip in it actually and never once did I have to divert from the expected next super charging stop which Tesla tries to get you to around approximately 15% battery left.

I disagree however that car makers try to be realistic in their estimates, which are self-supplied.  They absolutely do try to stretch the truth and use every tactic possible.  They have colluded to install mandatory engine stop idle, just to boost numbers.  They use very different tire pressures and conditions when generating MPG numbers than they do when showing and selling.  

Some just outright embellish and roll the dice on not being caught.  And even when caught, the consequences are minimal.  Only 10-15% are audited.

For example, the temperature the car is under can change drastically in the winter when your car goes form sitting in the garbage, to being outside in a snow storm with a steep wind chill. But if you relied on the estimate from when it was inside the garbage it would be wrong.

Plus there's a lot more then temperature and weather that effects range. The following also matters:

* Where are you driving to? The roads and road conditions can be much different on different roads.

* How fast are you driving?

* How often are you breaking to a stop and re-accelerating? This can be effected by how much traffic there is on the route you're on.

* How much weight is in your car (due to passengers and luggage)?

* Are you driving uphill or downhill?

Point being no one in their right mind should expect the range estimates to be 100% accurate. I mean we've been making ICE cars for over a century, and yet they STILL can't get their fuel gauges right.

Tesla allegedly programmed the in-dash range meters to show optimistic projections for driving range when fully charged, leading to customers having unrealistic expectations.

If it's percent, I have no clue how many miles that translates to beyond the rough 3:1 ratio. Distance is measured in miles, not percent after all. 

The only argument for % mode that makes sense to me is when you're handwringing over battery degradation and want to force yourself not to worry about it. But even then, you'll eventually notice that it now takes 11% to get to work instead of the 10% it did last month.",eisbock,2023-07-29 14:54:02

It's fairly difficult for it to be exact. On many reviews of the Lightning, Rivian, and Tesla, th

I literally have access to both the Lightning and the Model-Y. Im tellingyou the Model Y is off by a lot ALWAYS. The Lightning is surprisingly accurate. We thought it was going to be like the Tesla but it isnt. Its usually off by maybe 1-2%. Note both my brother and I are engineers... we can do basic math and there are no other factors to consider.

The truth is this. Whatever formula Tesla uses, is very loose and always over estimates.

We have going back and forth to Temucula/Murieta from San Diego the last couple of month. We use both cars. There is no extreme condition to consider and the paths are generally the same. Last weekend, we took the M-Y. We went from 260mi to 70mi range. But the trip was only 164mi trip. So it should have had 96miles left. It was off by 26miles. The same trip with the lightening a couple of weeks ago took us from 250mi to 84mi... the Lightening was off by only 2 miles.

Im not a Ford fan so dont misunderstand me. Im not suggesting to buy a Lightning especially after the price hikes. But what im saying is Tesla is playing fast and loose with their software.",thejumpingsheep2,2023-07-28 02:24:51

And yes, there definitely was! When you press the puff onto the cushion, definitely tap the excess off on the backside of the cover in the compact. You'll see how much product comes off the puff. And what's actually left on the puff is what I need. It doesn't look like a lot, but it goes a long way and covers my face with a medium coverage. I would say, if you're into the super full coverage look, dont tap it off. Personal preference is key to this cushion foundation.

as for the laneige, i‚Äôve only ever tried one other cushion before, namely the silkygirl magic bb cushion, and compared to that i liked that the laneige felt lighter and less stuffy on my face. i also like the subtle glow it gives! however i notice that after a few hours, it starts to separate and become patchy especially around my nose and chin. it also makes me break out :/ tho to be fair, I‚Äôve yet to find a foundation that has not broken me out LOL

I am pale and these have pretty good shades for me, the unleashia cushion in the lightest shade is a little yellow, the Clio is a little pink and the espoir is perfect and goes the lightest in shade range I‚Äôve ever had in foundations. I have dry skin and prefer dewy foundations and these all fit that with medium buildable coverage. I haven‚Äôt tested them in the summer yet (I live in the uk) but I feel they will work just fine. I always set lightly with a matte powder which reduces how glowy my base is and sets it in place so my foundation doesnt transfer and I always set with a setting spray. If you have acne I layer concealer under and on top of foundation and use a uk brand powder foundation to set the blemishes for full coverage. If your skin is reacting this way to the foundations I‚Äôd assume something is wrong, I haven‚Äôt heard someone burning to these foundations before. Personally I didn‚Äôt like the tirtir red cushion as the coverage is great but it‚Äôs a bit too much coverage for me and the lighter shades in the range are crazy yellow on my skin tone. I‚Äôd recommend checking your skincare to see if you can be reacting to that, and make sure you aren‚Äôt allergic to ingredients in the foundations. Your skin and eyes being reactive makes me think that your skin is damaged (my skin burns when it is damaged and reacts to both my skincare and makeup). I may be wrong but that‚Äôs just what your symptoms remind me of. People always say to use water based products with primers and silicone products with silicone primers so that they are less likely to pill on the skin and apply badly. However I‚Äôve never had an issue and don‚Äôt check ingredients lists. I would recommend trying your skincare routine + spf then waiting 10 mins before doing ur makeup. I found my makeup and foundation always pills in places and becomes patchy if I haven‚Äôt given my skincare enough time to absorb. I have also heard spf can cause foundations to break down and seperate on the skin faster over time and so far have found this is true it‚Äôs just trialling different products together to find ur match. My other thought is that maybe ur application is causing the issues with the foundations but I might be wrong. I always apply foundation to the centre of my cheeks, chin and forehead in small amounts and blend out to the edges of my face and build up the product in layers for better coverage. never drag ur cushion, sponges or brushes on ur face to prevent patches, pilling and uneven foundation. I hope this helps somehow? üòÅ",bunnybunny2003,2024-04-12 16:29:05

The application of the cushion itself picks product back up (I find that it gets worse the older the cushion is). You could do what some Korean youtubers do and pick up the product with a spatula to use like a liquid foundation to see if it's a problem with the application. Another thing you could try is blotting the cushion and applying it in super thin layers. You could also check if it's interacting weirdly with your skincare or primer. 

I had a similar issue for a really long time. I haven't tried the tirtir or romand cushion, but I have tried the black clio cushion and I hate it lol. If a bunch of influencers are receiving gifts from the company or promoting their own discount codes, I'm automatically distrustful lol. My favorite cushions were the laneige neo matte cushion and the wakemake water velvet cushion, but nothing was actually as good as normal liquid foundation. It is more hygienic and less prone to oxidizing/drying out over time anyways, and I'd say just to stick with what you're alreacy comfortable with if it works.",syusyubie,2024-04-12 19:16:35

I'm not sure what a branded foundation is, but I just went back from Korea and I bought there the Banila Co cushion (foundation). It looked super natural over there, while having great buildable coverage, but being back in my hometown (in France), I feel like the much less humid climate made the foundation drying to my skin, and thus much more visible with time (in some areas). I have combination skin with acne, and a tendency to dehydration.
Anyway the cushion is not super affordable, but it comes with a recharge (at least when I bought it in Olive Young that's how it was) so it makes it a lot cheaper. Good luck!!",aerialgirl7,2024-08-21 22:01:28

Such a weird quote considering Tekken is pretty much the ONLY 3D fighter now and has always been by far the most popular. Virtua Fighter is dead in the water, Dead or Alive is dust, and Soulcalibur never reached the sales numbers BamCo wanted, and Okubo was the one who championed 6 to be made in the first place and now works as CEO of CyGames America on Granblue Versus.

Overall, I really do hope the shift to being more aggressive helps the game rather than deters, especially since Tekken is often seen as a legacy game, where people who have been playing since Tekken 3 could jump right into Tekken 7 and 90% of the things they did can be done in 7.",BeardyDuck,2024-01-23 14:22:37

> **Arcade Quest**

> Tekken 8 has a lot more to offer players than just an exciting storyline. For newcomers just getting their feet wet, there‚Äôs Arcade Quest, a mode that takes players through the ins and outs of the game as a whole, teaching various aspects such as combat tips, avatar creation and customization, and much more. This is such a fantastic mode and I cannot state enough how much this mode can improve, to some degree, your gameplay just by playing through it.

> **Special Style**

> The Heat System can be complicated enough to reward hardcore players, but newcomers can still enjoy everything the game has to offer with the introduction of the Special Style control scheme, which I absolutely adore. Special Style can be instantly activated with a touch of a button during a match, and will allow players to pull off impressive moves and strings simply by repeatedly tapping any of the face buttons. This ensures that newcomers can step in and be competitive in a matter of minutes.

> This type of simplified control scheme has been implemented in other fighting games as well to varying levels of acceptance from the community. Tekken 8 handles it with care, and while it is a bit more flexible than others by allowing players to input different moves with the addition of the D-Pad, the skill ceiling is still low compared to manually controlling every aspect of the character. Newcomers will certainly benefit the most here, and it‚Äôs great to see the game bring players to the fun part as fast as possible.

> The best thing about the Special Style control scheme is that it allows players to jump in and out of characters with ease, dipping their feet to try out various characters to see if it fits their playstyle in a matter of minutes. Tekken 8 removes the burden of having to go through a long list of moves only to find out that you don‚Äôt jive with the playstyle. Of course, Special Style is purely optional, and it‚Äôs nice that there‚Äôs always that choice!

> One thing Tekken 8 does to great success is to onboard players in such a way that makes the whole process fun and engaging. While there is a bit of reading to be done, players will spend most of their time in exercises and actual immersion in the action which make learning such an interactive experience. You‚Äôll run through the basics of combat, unlocking rewards along the way as you complete missions, all in an arcade environment that reminds us of how fighting game communities were formed during the arcade heyday.",WeeziMonkey,2024-01-23 15:26:27

The heat system is a welcome change and feels pretty balanced already (chip damage needs some work imo, but not too bad). KBD is nerfed but still good and very important. Wall carry is still wild but combo damage is completely balanced and health recovery justifies what damage you can get anyway. There is a larger emphasis on frame data and character/matchup knowledge in this game due to the increased aggression. Wall-carry characters like Lee and Lars are actually worth playing in this game due to the stage design being what it is. Offense is stronger than defense, but not overly so like in SF6. For example, the heat bound thing is great for both offense as well as defense since it adds to your pressure and gives you the threat of a heat smash while on the offensive, AND it serves as a tool to shut down the opponents pressure and put yourself in a favorabls position again. Inputs are easier, which is something some pros hate, but I feel like it's a great and necessary change. I think focusing on knowledge and application rather than input mastery is a great way to move this game forward. Best Tekken since 6 imo.",Key_Caterpillar7941,2024-01-27 20:57:07

He gave an example of a fight against an NPC that always ended combos in mids as a way to get the player to practice blocking and parrying mids in a way that's more natural than ""stand in the training room, read the text box on how to block a mid, do it once, then move on."" I've been asking for a fighting game to do this for AGES. So....does Arcade Quest *actually* do that? Or was that a one-off example he gave, and it's mostly just a way to string random fights together instead of being a good teaching tool?",Galaxy40k,2024-01-23 17:19:46

Turns out the secret to a good fighting game is making a good fighting game, with plenty of content and nice to look at, since most serious players will stare at it for hours on end.

Even games with lower player retention were actually very well received since then, like DNF Duel, Crosstag Battle, Battle for the Grid, and many others.

What's made your attempts unsuccessful?

Have you tried SF6?  World Tour mode is actually amazing for drilling mechanics into your head and helping you get familiar with different characters' movesets, all with low-stress quick fights against NPCs and mini games.

Low-mid ranks fundamentals will get you very far. Going into higher ranks knowledge becomes a bit more important. The decently sized roster and huge movesets for each character means that you might get caught off guard now and then, but realistically most characters have a smaller core kit they use and won't make use of the entire move list, so once you've got a handle on those and what to expect it's not too bad.

The heat and health recovery systems in T8 also look to make things a bit more accessible in this regard. If someone has terrible fundamentals but catches you off guard because you fail a knowledge check and they get you into a combo, you can still outplay them on fundamentals and get a big chunk of your health back.",Bimbluor,2024-01-23 16:17:58

T8 gives players more tools to learn, the game even has a replay takeover feature so you can go back to a certain moment during a match where your opponent was constantly using a knowledge check against you, so you can do things differently to get an answer to that specific problem.



It's a ton of work with 32 characters in the base roster, lots of legacy knowledge will carry over for sure. But if you have friends who play or a community to learn with, it makes the learning process much more fun",HenyrD,2024-01-23 17:13:47

Fundamentals are just as important if not more than SF but labbing and practicing and labbing is always important. Luckily with Tekken 8 they're adding a new system that allows you to jump back into a replay of a match and practice on the fly, which is incredible and will make the practicing process so much more enjoyable

Personally I can't wait, to me the fact that practicing specific things allows me to improve a lot is one of the most important aspects of this series and after a while you'll find it easy to adapt on the fly even with things you don't know because you'll recognize the patterns",Colosso95,2024-01-23 18:37:59

* It's FREE to access 70% of the game, so if you decide you don't like GBFVSR or if you don't like fighting games, it cost you zero dollars to try
* The inputs are stupidly simple, with half the buttons SF has and dead-simple inputs that even SHOW YOU ON SCREEN EVERY MATCH what your specials are. So *even if you forget your own character's moves*, you'll see an icon saying ""Forward plus Special is a Fireball"" lol
* The basic combos are super super easy to do and *almost universal* across most of the cast. You can do jump in, attack x3, Brave crystal spend into attack x2 into Super, which is two buttons. It litterally couldn't be easier. You can just jab lights and then spam H+Special plus any direction on half the cast and get combos
* ALL your resources reset every round, so you don't have to learn any resource management for the match. You don't need to learn Manon medals or Super Gauge saving or anything. Just go pedal to the metal every round
* The tutorial and training are insanely in depth. There's even built-in tests so you can learn how to counter each other character's most annoying moves
* You get a PARTNER who COACHES YOU after every single match. They will tell you you have to avoid grabs more, or watch meter more, or that you need to spend more time on offense, etc. The game literally tells you why you lost

The consensus seems to be on the 3D part of it. All fighters that have rollback right now are on a 2D planes, so it's basically just ""fast forward"" for rollback. This fast forward often doesn't show up because of what is called ""blending"". 

Basically, let's say an opponent does a kick that is 17 frames, at 60 fps. You have 166.6666ms ping with your opponent, or 10 frames of latency. What will happen is that on your screen, when you just receive your opponent's input, it will play the kick that is normally in 17 frames in 7 frames. So you still get the full visual cue of the attack, just faster.

Tekken 8 doesn't seem to have a good implement of blending, so often times, especially when side steps are involved, it ends up being teleport rollback, which is still rollback, but kinda terrible. The issue with this teleport rollback is that it just jumps to whatever frame it syncs up to. So a 17 frame kick would now teleport to the 10th frame and then finish it. Tekken 8 sidesteps are 6 frames, which is 100ms. So if you got 50ms ping, which is pretty reasonable, all sidesteps will begin on frame 3-4. At 100ms it just looks like your opponent is teleporting up and down.",Icemasta,2024-01-24 03:20:42

It definitely did. I remember discourse at the time being 'Man, at least one fighting game managed to launch in a decent state' while Tekken 7 was as barebones as ever for the series, it's just that SF5 was such a bummer in its launch state that, by comparison, Tekken 7 looked much better. Because hey, it had a much bigger roster, a story mode out the gate, arcade mode, and customisation, and by those merits alone it absolutely shit on SF5 to a lot of people. 

More critically I'd say the story mode was 10% amazing and 90% meh, the arcade mode was short as hell, and the customisation was gimped over prior titles, *but* it still played good and looked nice and that those features were there at all was a step up from the franchise that invented the arcade mode not having a fucking arcade mode lol.",BLACKOUT-MK2,2024-01-24 18:05:05

Tekken 8 Review Thread,728,2024-01-23 14:00:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19dp29n/tekken_8_review_thread/,Games,"Here was my mental process and approach with SF6 that worked for me.

First, I started by doing the tutorials like 3-4 times until they were ingrained in my memory.  Some people will tell you that if you're a newcomer, you should just ""Jump in and start playing; that's how we had to do it back in the arcade days.""  

Those people are wrong.  Understanding the basics is pretty instrumental to having a good time with a fighting game, not to mention avoiding button-mashing.  Blocking, throws, parries, and knowing which buttons do what is going to help you overcome a lot of early hurdles.

Then, I played through all of World Tour.  As I mentioned, you get these nice, bite-sized tutorials on just about everything.  You might fight an enemy that only does jump attacks and start learning anti airs.  Or you slice up pizzas with the charge motion to learn charge characters.

This part is important: Pick a character you're excited to learn.  Only play as them.  Your passion for playing as a character that seems cool to you and execute their moves will carry you a lot further than picking a meta character you're not as excited about.  For me, I stuck with Marisa early on because I dug her design and moveset.  I had no idea if she was beginner friendly or low-tier; it didn't matter.  I just wanted to learn a cool character, and that kept me motivated.

After that, I got my feet wet with Ranked mode.  And Ranked is definitely the way to go, because you'll be matched with people who are you skill level.  People get ""ladder anxiety"" way too easily and avoid Ranked modes in games because of the fear of losing.  But in fighting games, you should be eager to fall where you need to in order to let the matchmaking pair you up with opponents who are your speed.  That's the best way to improve.

And that was kind of it.  I looked up some Youtube videos to understand my characters best punish options and learned a few bread and butter combos.  And with time and practice, it all just clicked.  I'm far from the best player, but now I can actually execute combos, bait and punish attacks, and know how to manage my meter.  And I still play SF almost every day (since it launched in June) which is a pretty huge feat in itself.",breadrising,2024-01-23 20:01:08

Meanwhile I tried out GBVSR and I'm positively addicted to it and I've managed to get higher than I ever expected in an FG (it's just B rank but it's something!).

Basically, I'd say that Granblue is pretty darn accessible for beginners with simple inputs not making you lose anything as compared to motion inputs outside of 10% extra damage on specials in neutral. Really lets me feel like I'm not playing a gimped version of the character. Also 4 button focus makes it a lot more friendly to controllers as compared to SF with 6 that tries to condense it as best as it can to 4 for Modern controls.

Or maybe we've been there and done that and are just trying to explain that a game being accessible boils down to a lot more than having a gigantic player base like SF or Tekken. The majority of the players will be in low ranks, so even if only 100 people were playing, there'll be other low-ranked players to play with. Yeah, there are more new players in SF, but there will always be enough people at every rank to play for GBVSR.

Seriously, it doesn't make sense to you that considering we've taken the time to learn a bunch of new FGs over the years we probably have a better idea of what constitutes a high learning curve compared to someone who just got into their first FG? You don't think assuming you know more than everyone here who's telling you that you're wrong seems arrogant of you?

Players in the trenches of GBVSR are similar to those in other FG trenches. The major differences are the skill gap to get to higher ranks in a game like GBVSR are much tighter, and that an Iron player in SF can still body a completely new player. At least in GBVSR you can mash your way to victory as a new player occasionally. And this is coming from someone who mains SF and loves it. It's my main game.",The_Crownless_King,2024-01-24 00:09:57

It has been a while since I played but I'm just pondering if you only played the arcade mode because the story mode had a decent amount going for it, it was basically SF6 World Tour in a more primitive form and a source for a lot of praise when it came out, during the era where SP content in fighting games was almost non-existant.",8-Brit,2024-01-24 16:38:19

I suppose I'm hoping for a few things to happen; one would be some changes to the mechanics with Season 2 after the first big balance patch.  I'm sure there will be a lot of core mechanics nerfed/changed (Drive Rush, Drive Rush Cancel, Perfect Parry, Throw Loops) which will make the game exciting to play again.  Then ideally, some underused characters get some love.  I don't have a problem playing a ""low-tier"" character.  But some of them feel like they're missing essential tools, which makes them hard to pick up in their current state (Kimberly, for example).

The next big thing that could happen, as you mentioned, the roster could get more interesting with the DLC characters.  Who knows, maybe Ed will be my next main?

My issue right now is how slow characters are to launch.  4 DLC fighters throughout a whole year is a very slow trickle of content.  It'd be more understandable if we were also getting things in between like new stages, new costumes, new game modes, more balance patches that shake up the meta.  Hell, even change up the Battle Hub every once in a while to give people a reason to come check it out!  But no.  We're stuck in this cycle of waiting for 1 big balance patch a year, 4 slowly doled out characters a year, and a sprinkling of boring avatar cosmetics.

I love SF6 so much.  Capcom has a winner on their hands but doesn't seem eager to keep the content coming; they're going at their own pace.  On some level, I respect it.  But at the same time, there are way too many good fighting games right now serving as competition.",breadrising,2024-01-24 13:18:40

Though I will say it's one of the most fun fighting games to spectate 

My point is that fighting games, despite being around for decades, is a very niche genre. Most gamers prefer team games over the pressure of 1v1 and the much higher barrier of entry that comes with fighting games. 

So DBFZ massive success is very important. A rising tide lifts all boats. You can see the impact of the game on the FGC all over the place. I've got so many friends that started playing fighting games because they bought DBFZ.

Granblue is also a big attractor for casuals since it has even simpler controls than SF6, is based off a popular mobile game, and has good single player offerings including a literal Fall Guys mode. It doesn‚Äôt have a world tour equivalent but the tutorials are very solid as well.

Swatches of Many Different Korean Cushion Foundations on Skin Tone MAC NC25-30 / Korean Shade 23-25,137,2023-07-17 20:54:33,https://i.redd.it/pf83u7hc9lcb1.jpg,AsianBeauty,"I've bought many cushions over the past 1-1.5 years and wanted to swatch them for you! It took me a long time to find my shade, so I hope this helps in any way. My wrist goes a bit more tan as it gets closer to my elbow by quite significantly, but I hope that it's still easy to compare the swatches.

When choosing a cushion foundation, there are many aspects to consider: your skin type (mine is dry), your undertone (cool vs warm) and your shade.

**Honorable Mentions regarding Shade Range:**

*sharing some thoughts and things i've learned as i've gone through so many different foundations!*

* **rom&nd** is the only brand that can do a tanner/medium tone without a huge orange cast. this is not surprising, because they flaunt this as one of their strengths when marketing. also, their cushions are **very forgiving** and will oxidize to closer to your skin tone. olive or cooler skin tones that need shade 25, i definitely recommend rom&nd. rom&nd's 05 sand (intended for shade 25) doesn't have an orangey cast unlike its counterparts in clio's or jsm's lines.
* **jungsaemmool** has, technically, the most flexible shade range, without compromising quality. when i was most tan, jsm's medium-deep (25+) cushion was a great fit for me, but was definitely more orange than i would like. now that my tan is gone, medium (23) is now one of my best fit.

**Honorable Mentions regarding Dry Patches and Evenness:**

*as someone with dry skin, my biggest priority isn't coverage, but its forgiveness on dry patches.*

* **jungsaemmool essential nuder cushion** is, and forever will be my #1 holy grail. with its light coverage that can be buildable, it won't cling to your dry patches even if you haven't exfoliated the best. jsm was the first cushion i found a close color match on, and i instantly learned why cushion foundations were amazing, and learned quickly that not all cushions are so amazing.
* **rom&nd's nu zero and bare water cushions** are very forgiving for all dry, combo and oily skin. specifically, the nu zero cushion, despite its intended semi-matte and higher coverage (compared to jsm), it can still be applied evenly. the bare water cushion applies evenly due to light coverage, but can get dry throughout the day due to high water content. it is important to use a moisture balm or mist to rehydrate throughout the day for the bare water one, but both do not cling to dry spots for me.
* **clio's glow mesh cushion** is one of the best cushions in the market for dry skin. i don't wear this much, because the shade is just a bit too pinkish for my liking, but when i do - i know it'll apply evenly. the mesh allows just enough product to sink through, which i appreciate. in retrospect, the old edition new founwear cushion clings heavily to my dry spots regardless of the amount of prep, and there's an evident difference in the formula.

**Cushions I Won't Buy Again / Won't Recommend**

*i realize that as i write these, i'm not writing any reviews on the other cushions, so i'm going to try to explain why i didn't like the other cushions as much, or things to be aware of.*

* **holika holika hard cover perfecting cushion (tanning edition)** was one of my purchases in attempt to find a cushion that had my shade. it has a medium, buildable and semi-matte formula, which is known to not be too great for dry skin. my main nitpick is the over-the-top orangeness of this though (which isn't reflected in the ad swatches). if you have a honey beige, very warm skin tone, this might work for you, but it didn't for me, nor did anything for my dry skin. **too cool for school** also fell into this bucket, except it has an even smaller shade range than the former, whilst still having the same orange shade.
* **sulwhasoo perfecting cushion ex** is one of the more high-end cushions i've tried - i tried it bc it seemed to have a larger shade range. however, i personally find their shade 25 more like a 23-24, and it's really hard to get an even coverage of this, and heavily clings to dry spots.
* **clio's kill cover founwear (old edition)** is probably one of the worst of all when it came to dry patches. it just clung to them, and even when i was trying to clean it with a cotton bud and some serum, it would just spread and make a bigger mess elsewhere.

**Final Thoughts**

there's also other cushions i've tried, such as etude house's double lasting, aprilskin cushion, amuse, espoir, and also different cushions by the same brand (e.g. rom&nd's bare water, clio's kill cover new founwear new edition, etc). if you have any questions or want more swatches let me know! :D",PasteIIe,2023-07-17 21:17:37

for context, the reason why i got both was - i was a lot more tan then (traveling and going outdoors a lot) and the 04 ginger just wouldn't work for me, so i got the old edition (they discontinued 05 sand in 2023 releases).

here's a swatch between the clio mesh glow, new kill cover founwear, and old kill cover founwear cushion.

I've only tried the Le Cushion Encre de Peau from YSL and not the asia-exclusive glow cushion. I imagine the dimensions are the same though (seems like the compact has the same size when i googled)

I tried swapping the refills around onto the YSL compact and none of the refills seem to fit properly (i tried the JSM/clio/romand). the issue i noticed is on the left of cushions, theres a hinge to separate the cushion and puff, and that hinge doesn't fit properly across cushions (even if the circumference would fit properly). I attached a photo of what i meant by the hinge. Displayed cushion is the rom&nd x sanrio Nu Zero 21 Pure cushion.

So, just to be clear... you're creating a marketing campaign for a Korean makeup brand that is only sold in South Korea. Your ad features only Korean women, because your target market is Korean women... and your friend has a problem with that? Wtf?

I am a pretty liberal woman, and I agree with your friend that racial erasure in cosmetics is definitely a problem. But it's a problem in the context of global makeup companies who, in theory, should be marketing to all women. When the company exists in a single country that does not have a racially diverse population, then it makes no sense to focus on racial diversity in marketing.

I can see where she was coming from, personally. Whitewashing is a huge problem in the makeup industry, especially in Asia, where pale = beautiful, and this sucks for darker skinned asian folks, racism and colorism is particularly bad there. 

By more diverse, I‚Äôm sure she meant more variation in skin tones, not different races altogether. Because no, Koreans aren‚Äôt just all naturally paper white looking. But according to beauty standards many Koreans strive to be, usually with makeup. 

Is this your fault in particular? Not really, you were just doing your job running a marketing campaign.

In 2003, a political economist named Alberto Alesina published a breakdown of all countries by ethnic fractionalization, linguistic fractionalization, and religious fractionalization in the *Journal of Economic Growth*. The breakdown isn't perfect, since obviously what constitutes a different ethnicity, language, or even religion isn't universally agreed on. And of course, there were a few countries he was unable to get data for. But of the nearly 200 countries and territories he did have data for, South Korea was the fourth least ethnically diverse. Only Comoros, North Korea, and Japan were more ethnically homogeneous. You can see the list for yourself [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level#List_based_on_Alesina_et_al's_analysis), on Wikipedia, or [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/alesina/publications/fractionalization), if you want the full article.

If I had a client that was looking to market something in South Korea, I'd tell them that unless it was an **extremely** niche product we could be reasonably certain would appeal to virtually 100% of whatever non-ethnically Korean demographic they're targeting, I wouldn't even bother thinking about anyone that isn't ethnically Korean when developing the marketing campaign. It's simply not a large enough population to bother with.

That said, it probably would have been best if you simply didn't engage with this woman beyond your first response. Allowing it to become heated is a poor decision, regardless of who was in the right.",HaudNomen,2020-10-12 22:59:11

I‚Äôll keep this short.

So I work for a very large multinational cosmetics company in their in-house marketing dept. Recently I was given the chance to lead a small marketing project for a South Korean makeup brand my company just acquired. It‚Äôs pretty small and hasn‚Äôt gone global but it‚Äôs already got a solid customer base in Korea, so I was pretty excited. 

Anyways we finished the campaign a few weeks ago and I posted a few videos and photos on my own personal social media. Immediately a friend of mine commented on why I‚Äôm ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù a brand that appears very intentionally non-diverse (the ad features 4 Korean women each holding a foundation product, all light shades). I DM‚Äôd her saying it‚Äôs a Korean ad specifically for Korean women, assuming that was sufficient explanation. 

Then, a few days later I see her publicly calling me out and saying how disappointed she is that her friend is promoting ‚Äúracial erasure‚Äù in cosmetics, which she says is a huge problem. Anyways I messaged her again to please not use me as some kind of villain in an issue that‚Äôs not even relevant to my specific campaign. She tells me she‚Äôs just ‚Äúcalling it as she sees it‚Äù and I get mad and tell her she‚Äôs an idiot and to go fuck herself. 

Long story short, she ended up posting our entire exchange as a way to ‚Äúout‚Äù me as some kind of bigot. Thankfully most people who actually know me thinks she‚Äôs out of line, but I have gotten some harassment from randoms. I feel a little bad because a few friends have told me I should have had a dialogue with her over her concerns. I think I definitely lost my temper after she targeted me directly and I was also upset she completely ignored my first explanation. But yeah, I still told her to F off which is there in text. AITA?

The population in the Korean peninsula is one of the most homogenous populations in the world, in no small part due to closing their borders basically until Japan invaded in 1945. After the armistice of the Korean war in 1952, Americans have been all over that place and things have changed. They've even changed a lot since I lived there, 14 years ago. But still, the racial demographics are still very homogenous.

You can't copy and paste American racial representation expectations onto other places. The United States has an utterly unique perspective on racial justice and racial dynamics because of our history of immigration (and colonization and genocide and slavery). It makes vastly more sense to advocate for representational parity in US based media, but that same standard cannot be applied to most other countries.

White guy living in Asia -

The fact that your comments seem to suggest 
 the cosmetics you're advertising don't contain skin whiteners (like the majority of cosmetics in the region) is daring.

Including black/brown women in the marketing would get responses varying from ""That's interesting."" to ""I'm not buying it.""

I'm gonna guess that as the guy/gal putting the ads together, you have some idea that skin color isn't viewed in the same way as in the West. (some people have already mentioned this in comments)
I would applaud anyone trying to break down 'color barriers' in Asia, but honestly, I don't think you're in a good position to do that. Most of your competition are selling on the concept of making skin *whiter* thus *prettier*.

Although the friend doesn‚Äôt seem to come from a racist intent, it absolutely is at the very least racially insensitive to east asians.

Obviously cannot judge without looking at the ad but while S Korea is more racially homogenous compared to the US or France for example, it is becoming more culturally and racially diverse. Also racism against non-traditionally Korean presenting people is high too and by that I generally mean racism against people with darker skin. There has been encouraging signs of embracing multi-cultural, multi-racial Korea on media but it still has far to go.

It's a shame that you didn't use your global cosmetic marketing experience to do some good.

To clarify, this brand isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúwhitening‚Äù brands. Their skin tones are actually pretty varied and would cater for darker skinned Asians as well as the lighter ones.

To push too many ethnicities in a region like South Korea would be folly and lead to the marketing campaign failing to some extent. 

Regional campaigns have to essentially represent the the region they are running in. Since South Korea largely has one ethnicity living there, The campaigns there have to reflect that to be relatable to the people living there and to then be successful.

I think you should report this incident to your company, because, by association, that concerns them as well. You are an employee of X company, so everything you say publicly could be taken as a company statement, including the ""fuck off"" part.

Besides, they might help you if the dogpiling gets out of hand.

However, and I'm really not trying to tell you how to do your job, but as I am related to Korean people it always kinda concerns me when I read posts like this, you need to keep *Korean* diversity in mind. 

Not all Koreans are ""lightish-skinned"", and the fair skin stereotype is a very toxic one that promotes bullying from an early age, and further discrimination as adults. As a result, many Koreans, especially women, resort to shady cosmetic treatments to lighten their skin, which could be very damaging on the long run. I think it would be awesome to see some skin diversity, according to the reality of people in Korea. There's also the weight/body shape stereotypes, but that's other story...

In a way race/ethnicity/diversity have no fixed permanent value, so what they signify might change in different populations and over time. By depicting and embracing a spectrum of natural East Asian skin tones, your ad seems very inclusive in the context of a homogenous population such as Korea.

Haiti is a country that is similarly homogenous, yet a campaign that featured a line up of black models with a gradient of natural skin tones would likely be recognized for promoting inclusion and not criticized as erasing Asian and Hispanic identities.",chief_robotman,2020-10-12 22:59:01

I wouldn't say ""racist"" because it's more ""colorist,"" but I can see someone using those terms interchangeably as well. 

I'm not saying every region needs every brand to have cosmetics in every possible shade/undertone, but they need to cover the range in the target demographic (while taking into account marginalized demographics) . I'm from the US (and white), so if a brand targeted toward dark skin came out and didn't have my shade, I wouldn't care. There are plenty of brands that have my shade. But, a company focusing just on ""light"" shades would grind my gears because cosmetic companies have discriminated against deeper skin tones for *years* (in the US). They used the argument that the deeper colors didn't sell, but their range on that end of the spectrum was so bad, of course it wouldn't sell. 

East Asian cosmetics have a long history of ignoring darker complexions within their target demographics, which ties into the cultural value of light-skin is better, which discriminates against people with darker skin. It's a problem. Without seeing OP's ad, I don't know what OP meant by ""lighter"" shades. But it makes me wonder. 

The friend was wrong to drag OP on social media as if OP alone was the one to determine the shade range. But, depending on OP's conversation with the friend on the rationale behind the range, I could see being upset over that.

No, because its not trying to be all things to all people, and nor should it. Advertising is about knowing your demographic and selling it to them specifically. Yes, there are times when the advertising world falls down in the inclusivity dept. But the marketing of a Korean product to Korean people in Korea isn't one of those times.

Well that depends where you‚Äôre at. In the US, whiteness is privileged. In general, perhaps it‚Äôs better to say light skin tones are sought after due to how whiteness has been seen as the beauty standard‚ÄîI myself am not Asian, but live in an area with a high population of Asian immigration, and have a lot of friends who are Asian, I met a lot of them working at a skin/hair care store. A lot of them would tel me about how dark skin is not seen as beautiful, and would talk about how they would be praised for having light skin. We got a lot of Asian clients coming in asking for scrubs, lotions, etc that would whiten or bleach their skin (which we didn‚Äôt sell). After asking around, it turns out that ‚Äúskin whitening‚Äù products are sold in Asia, similar to how these products used to be targeted at Black Americans because light skin (due to societies that privilege and hold white bodies as the standard) is seen as beautiful. This isn‚Äôt okay, and comes from the fact that light skinned people are the ones being cast in movies, ads, or are the pop stars. Now, we are seeing more diversity in the US at least, but that comes from a long push towards inclusivity and diversity. Yet, I still can‚Äôt name a single person from my race who is famous in the US, and who I can see in the media as representation. 

I recently heard a quote by Dr. Joycelyn Elders, who said that she didn‚Äôt think she could be a doctor because she didn‚Äôt see any black female doctors, so she wanted to be a lab technician because she had seen that. We don‚Äôt think we can be what we don‚Äôt see.",Uma__,2020-10-13 01:46:27

I don‚Äôt know as much about European populations (besides some mild research that was done from around 9/19 to 3/20‚Äìthis is not a bragging point, it really was fairly mild but politics are something I find really interesting and is relevant for the up-to-dateness of my opinion) but I do know that they are having an increase of diversity due to the Syrian refugee crisis. Especially for Northern Europe, this push for diversity can lead to better integration may/would be helpful as it exposes a homogenous group to dark-skinned people in a setting other than poor and fleeing a war. 

For Southern countries, like Spain, which is much closer to Africa and has a fairly high POC population (at least visually when I visited), it‚Äôs also similarly important because positive representation increases a child‚Äôs ability to think big for themselves. I would then go back and argue that this is also important for those countries with high populations of refugees, so that they themselves can see opportunity for themselves and face hopefully less resistance. 

Furthermore, as you touched on, there are many different cultural groups within Europe‚Äîfor example, the Sami in Nordic countries. Now, I can‚Äôt comment on how represented they are in Nordic culture, so I base my comment on my semi-limited knowledge of their treatment and my own experiences as an Indigenous person in North America, but studies show that negative (olden-times, or downtrodden, oppressive) representation in media results in positive self-images amongst non-Indigenous folks, and negative self-image amongst Indigenous people, especially children and adolescents. Due to this, I would say that even if Europe doesn‚Äôt show strong racial diversity (which it likely will need to over the common years), there should at least be a push for cultural and ethnic diversity (which, again, I cannot comment on how well or badly this is done in Europe, as I am not a European).",Uma__,2020-10-13 02:31:39

There, as well as in a lot of Asian countries, dark skinned is associated with stereotypes of poverty, and although it is known now that people can be naturally dark-skinned, the stereotype has been engrained in the collective mind, and is heavily reinforced by media and advertising, so I'm under the impression that, while younger generations don't consciously associate darker skin with poverty anymore, some still unconsciously don't like it as much as they like lighter skin.

However, things are changing, and body acceptance movements are picking up there, so I wouldn't say Koreans are generally colourists, especially the younger ones, and you most likely encountered some mean bullies, like you would in any group.",[deleted],2020-10-14 15:19:12

For Korean brands, I am typically 13 or 17 in foundations. For western brands, I am N10-15. I have very muted/neutral skin so everything tends to look too pink or orange on me.

I decided to include our lord and savior Missha Signature BB Cream 13 at the end. This is not a cushion, but it is a pretty good gauge for what the undertones of a product are because it is very neutral/grey.

Products listed: 
- Romand Nu Zero Cushion 17
- Espoir Be Glow Cushion 01 Vanilla
- Amuse Dew Jelly Cushion 01 Soonsoo
- Fwee Suede Cushion 01 Fair Suede
- Naming Layered Fit Cushion 17Y
- Javin De Seoul Wink Cushion 19 
- Missha Signature BB Cream 13",idratherbeinside,2024-01-15 05:00:26

The Missha bb cream is super close for me but I still haven't found something that matches my skin exactly without mixing.

Purito BB cream in #21 is literally the perfect match for my coloring, it's just too dark. Drives me nuts that Purito would make 2 lighter shades and make them pigmented as hell and super yellow or pink.",TheDodgyStalker,2024-01-15 14:27:11

A former holy grail foundation, CYO Life Proof, in shade 101 had a similar beige/gray undertone and I was crushed when the company closed.

[Swatches] The Lightest Shades of Korean Cushion Foundations,41,2024-01-15 05:00:02,https://i.redd.it/dvf4de3zcjcc1.jpeg,PaleMUA,the lightest foundation I've ever found is vdl #A00 it's almost white but still skin like I use it mostly in winter bc I get a bit darker during the summer and it's really light. If you have ghost like skin it's going to be perfect for you also it blends with the skin very nicely so even If it's a bit do light it will still look natural,IreneEnjoyer,2024-09-21 23:20:48
[Swatches] The Lightest Shades of Korean Cushion Foundations,41,2024-01-15 05:00:02,https://i.redd.it/dvf4de3zcjcc1.jpeg,PaleMUA,"I found your post after struggling with the Clio Kill Cover Mesh Glow in 2-Lingerie, which comes in the most lovely finish for my dry skin but is just slightly too dark/yellow tinged for me. It's workable, especially since I love how it looks finish-wise, but given the name #2 I was hoping there was a paler shade #1 - turns out it only exists in three shades and for whatever reason, #2 is the lightest. Baffling.

Could you maybe speak to the texture/finish of the Naming Layered Fit Cushion if you get the chance? I'm looking for something extremely glowy, coverage is not a huge deal, but ideally moisturizing without clinging to dry patches. The Naming Layered looks to be a decent match for me and we have very similar tones.

It is one of the only truely grey products I've come across, and apparently that's a good match for my corpse skin lol

I've also heard that the purito 21 is very grey. A word of warning, do not try the purito 13 it's bright orange. You may want to check out white mixers to use with the 21 shade!",idratherbeinside,2024-01-15 14:45:56

[Swatches] The Lightest Shades of Korean Cushion Foundations,41,2024-01-15 05:00:02,https://i.redd.it/dvf4de3zcjcc1.jpeg,PaleMUA,"The best matches for my skin are Romand Nu Zero cushion 17, missha signature bb cream in 13, and naming layered cushion in 17.

If you have more yellow skin, the espoir be glow cushion in vanilla may be a good fit. I have other swatches of it in this post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaleMUA/s/xpJO32G9sS) 

The espoir cushion shades are slightly lighter than the foundation shades, so vanilla is the lightest shade available for the Be Glow cushion. 

If you want a liquid foundation, the Naming layered foundation in 17Y might work. It is basically identical to the Naming cushion swatch. But it's not as yellow as the espoir cushion, I would say its a more neutral with a bit of yellow.",idratherbeinside,2024-03-10 15:06:03

I wore it for between 4-8hours each time and found it wore differently depending on if I powdered. When I did not powder, I found that it would crease in my fine lines but it had a beautiful radiant look after a couple hours (without being too greasy). When I used powder on my t-zone, it did not crease along my nose bridge which was where the most prominent creasing was for me. It wears better than the amuse dew jelly and doesn't look as oily by the end of the day even without powder retouches.

Coverage is light which I love. The shade was actually great and I didn't notice any oxidation with my base makeup.

One weird thing I noticed is that it stings my eyes when I remove it with an oil cleanser. I have never had that before with any other foundation.

Overall, it is a great cushion for anyone who likes lightweight and low coverage cushions. It is probably one of the best wearing cushions on oily skin (especially for a dewy cushion) when combined with powder. Just be careful with the oil cleanser when you remove it!",mumstoejam,2024-05-12 11:36:28

It‚Äôs wonderful that there‚Äôs traction internationally but only the numbers will move things. I‚Äôm extremely well aware of non fair skinned people using Korean products and being a fan. 


I‚Äôm literally a Korean person that‚Äôs tan naturally, so it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôm well aware that people can be born with tanner skin. I‚Äôve been told to lighten my skin. I‚Äôve seen it all and experience it all so I don‚Äôt appreciate the patronizing comment saying ‚Äúpeople are born with dark skin‚Äù. I‚Äôve felt heavy discrimination and rude comments from the Korean community, I don‚Äôt need someone that isn‚Äôt even part of the culture or understand what‚Äôs really going on to tell me that. Ive been told to perm my hair straight since my hair was ‚Äúterrible‚Äù. I‚Äôve been told to lose weight and was fat because I am a hit curvier instead of the very thin body shape that is aligned with Koreans. With that being said it still does not change the fact that majority of the money still comes from preservation of fair skin. People lighten using creams and just using foundation that‚Äôs lighter. 


None of the Korean make up work for my skin tone at all. I absolutely adore typical Korean eyeshadow looks, products, clothes and hair products. I‚Äôm tanned, curvier and have thick wavy dehydrated uncontrollable hair. I am in no way saying these practices are ok by any means but I do understand why they do it.

One thing I learned is that to saturate the cushion, a lot of product needs to be used. At first it was scary emptying so much product into the compact but it works well when the cushion is nicely saturated! As long as the compact is kept tightly shut the makeup won‚Äôt dry out.

I use the shade G11, which is a light neutral shade. The formula is kinda runny/watery, so it was tricky to apply cause it tends to run everywhere. A cushion holds the product together well and keeps it condensed in one place. I‚Äôve been using it just like I would a cushion compact - for light coverage I sweep/blur more than I pat, for fuller coverage I pat/blot the applicator all over my face. It‚Äôs very easy to build and gives a soft natural finish, which is what I love about cushion compacts. 

I mentioned in another comment that the cushion needs to be saturated and it takes A LOT of product to do that. I emptied about 2/3 of the bottle at first and now my entire bottle is in the compact. There‚Äôs no issue w separation of ingredients from sitting in the cushion, which was what I was worried about at first. I can‚Äôt say the same for other foundations though, so YMMV. Also, I dampen the applicator like I would a beauty blender - I find it gives a smoother finish and saves more product!",[deleted],2021-02-08 02:51:27

Commenting so flippantly about a culture that you don‚Äôt seem to know much about and the very raw/painful issues that come with it isn‚Äôt for you to decide. 

 Also African Americans make a huge portion of the US population. Shade range issues have been a huge part in the US and many people of color buy foundation in that colour. The numbers are vastly different vs the US and S.Korea. At most it‚Äôs 200000 people that are in the darkest shade range (100000 being from African countries like Nigeria and so forth and the other 100000 being from the US <army>) Korea still remains to be over 97% with Asian people, about 2-3% being non Korean. 

.0004% vs 13% for what we usually see as the darker shade ranges. That‚Äôs an incredible gap and I almost doubled the numbers on the Korean side to see if it‚Äôll help. The number comparison you pulled for Korea vs a US company doesnt hold up at all. I take the issues that come with my country very seriously when it comes to cosmetics. It‚Äôs not only because of the personal experiences I had in my culture but how I‚Äôve seen other people suffer. Looking at the numbers, it is beyond in beneficial for these companies to properly formulate for darker skinned people. Some companies tried and they did a terrible job, colors being waaay too red is a common one. 


I understand it‚Äôs easy for you to comment whatever and be done with it but for a lot of people in this community it‚Äôs a very hot topic and a serious issue. It goes beyond just not having products available, it‚Äôs a cultural issue. Korea is one of the cosmetic capitals of the world and I do hope we move in a direction to be a leader.

You wrote this in English because it's the only language that we all speak, and language barrier divides cultures and communities, gives them a sense of belonging, allows them to be immersed in specific community and is something that hardly anyone is willing to give up. Italy and Germany, the biggest examples of benefits that came with unification, already spoke the same language (simplifying a bit and excluding Sicily).


While this is an excellent essay, I just fail to see how you'd practically go about any kind of unification without any sort of major crisis (and I'm talking way more major than Russian invasion of Ukraine). The way we're currently going is realistically the one with the biggest chance of success, especially with widespread adoption of English language in EU countries (irony of Brexit is not lost upon me with this), with more people than ever travelling abroad and with our economies being tightly interconnected.

(Some of) Europe had its glorious centuries, but that is far behind us now. Since the dawn of the 18th and especially the mid-turn of the 20th century, we are in an unpredictable and unprecedented era in which actors with wealth and influence far surpassing those of emperors of old exist. Tiny nations like mine have absolutely zero leverage on the international scale, not even able to protect their own interests. And their ability to protect the state's and its people's interest even on their own home turf is waning due to technological access and globalisation.

I dislike bureaucrats, but more than that i dislike neoliberal corporate culture and authoritarian figures. To truly be able to reject both of these requires that we band together for the common good to uphold the principles of civil liberties, separation of powers, religious and cultural freedoms (to an extent) and the harmful excesses the free markets. It is a fact of life that these are ideologically at odds with the rest of the world's powerful actors and these are also paradoxical amongst themselves because to uphold liberty and law you sometimes require authoritarian measures to be taken. It's not a task that any european nation is able to undertake. We have been left in the dust decades ago, but together it might be something that could actually happen.

-Your assertation that democracy, equality, freedom and human rights don't work because they are universal values ignores the fact that like... they're not. Or at least, not everybody considers them the *most* important things. On top of that, a country like the USA has 'freedom' as one its most import unifying values. You also don't actually give any other values, simply continuing on to talk about the need for propaganda.
-You dismiss the value of negative shared experiences. Shared experiences don't have to be heroic tales. Shared tragedy is an as strong if not stronger unifier. It is no coincidence that the European project finally took off shortly after WW2 and got spurred on by the Cold War. Both events are a source of shared trauma for European countries. 
-The Template you propose using for creating Euronationalism is based on 19th century ideas. I sincerely doubt that this would work today, and even if it could it ignores the fact that that approach played an important part in some pretty nasty stuff in the late 19th and 20th centuries. We shouldn't seek to replicate that style of nationalism.",Liutasiun,2024-08-13 07:57:43

Same as others I guess I didn't read it completely, but I did spend 10mins reading / skimming it.

My understanding of what you are trying to say is that if we wish to feel free and well as a society, EU or EU federation would be a great way to get there, as the alternatives are not that incredible. To achieve that we need people to feel the EU patriotism, although I would call it more like a belonging because I feel that patriotism has recently had a bad connotation. Following that literature, EU heroic figures, or more broadly stories would help us create that.

This is not advice, suggestion, or anything, maybe a discussion, or like a warning not to let it consume you, as yes rarely do I see such a long text from anyone, let alone on EU. A great starting way to become the next EU hero if you are that dedicated! (not really joking actually) If I consider solutions towards a stronger EU as a spectrum, yours is certainly on the further better side. However:

1. I think the current situation is different from whatever was happening in history. People migrated to the US because they wanted to be part of it, not all of course. The EU has a lot of people who think they got sucked into it without their consent.

2. The EU is quite young, especially considering states that keep being added, thus the idea of the EU is constantly shifting, and it would be hard to feel EU spirit as a westerner when the majority of EU might be represented by the east. Italy surely had its shifts as well, but I would claim it is easier to feel part of a medium sized state that was there, had a strong legacy, and shared language.

3. It is possibly one of the greatest solutions, I wouldn't be able to tell though, and yet humans are not really known for implementing the actually good solutions. Sadly we are lazy, and with the modern era so many more people have so many options to do anything else they actually want to do than write good literature about the EU, or read about it. As much as I am skeptical about AI, I don't see why it wouldn't be used in the education sector. I have yet to meet a person happy with any countries‚Äô education system, teachers are unhappy with pay and conditions, and considering that there are claims AI outperforms doctors on certain tasks, why wouldn't the AI be capable of providing a more objective and way more personalized approach to teaching than the majority of other teachers could. My teacher was way more patriotic than they should have ever been.

Great work, damn good solution as well for sure, how are we to implement it considering the different situation, and all the human weaknesses? I only warn you, don't get unhappy when humans are known for ignoring good solutions. What are your thoughts though?",PedoDorf,2024-08-13 09:02:15

### **Summary**

The text highlights the power of stories in shaping collective identities, suggesting that the continuous exposure to certain narratives can lead people to adopt a shared worldview and behavior. This concept, when applied to Europe, implies that storytelling can be a tool to create a true European identity, where citizens feel connected to each other beyond their national affiliations.

By revisiting historical examples of solidarity across European nations, the text argues that these stories can serve as the foundation for building a European identity. Figures like Giuseppe Mazzini, Victor Hugo, and Garibaldi, along with events like the 1848 revolutions and various acts of cross-national support during wars, are cited as instances that can inspire a sense of European unity.

### **Main Arguments for Why a United Europe Is Important**

1. **Strengthening Political Cohesion**:
   - A united Europe is crucial for the stability and effectiveness of its institutions. Without a shared identity and sense of unity among its citizens, European institutions risk losing legitimacy and the ability to function effectively.
   - The text argues that political institutions rely on a pre-political foundation of unity and virtue among the people. If Europeans see themselves as a collective ""we,"" it will strengthen the institutions that represent them.

2. **Cultural and Social Solidarity**:
   - The text emphasizes the importance of creating a shared European identity through narratives of solidarity and cooperation. Historical examples where Europeans supported each other across national lines demonstrate the interconnectedness of European nations.
   - A shared identity can help preserve the unity in diversity that Europe values, allowing for the coexistence of different cultures while fostering a sense of belonging to a larger community.

3. **Preventing Conflict and Promoting Peace**:
   - By promoting a common European identity, the text suggests that Europe can avoid the return of conflicts between nation-states, as envisioned by thinkers like Altiero Spinelli during and after World War II.
   - The idea of a united Europe is seen as a way to ensure peace, as it encourages collaboration and mutual support among nations, reducing the likelihood of future wars.

4. **Educational and Moral Development**:
   - The text argues that stories are essential for moral and emotional development. By teaching children and citizens stories of European solidarity, Europe can cultivate a sense of shared values and principles, such as democracy, freedom, and human rights.
   - This moral foundation is necessary for the preservation and continuation of these values within Europe, ensuring that they are understood and embraced not just intellectually, but also emotionally.

In conclusion, a united Europe is portrayed as vital for the political stability, cultural cohesion, and moral integrity of the continent. Through shared narratives of solidarity and cooperation, Europe can foster a true sense of belonging among its citizens, making the European project more resilient and enduring.",Naskva,2024-08-12 21:50:39

My point is that political projects of any kind, including the one you mention, need to be implemented on a European rather than a national scale in order to be meaningful. However, institutions alone are not enough to make this work, but there must be an emotional glue that binds citizens together and acts as fuel for the institutional machine (this is what I call patriotism in its best version). In this sense, I believe that Europe will only be able to become a superpower (and solve its internal problems) if it is also and above all united from this point of view, otherwise it will only be seen as a means to another goal (obtaining European funds with a view to national interests) and will fail.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-12 21:56:03

However, I have only two doubts about this: Firstly, even to make Zelensky the European Garibaldi would require the action of intellectual vanguards capable of preparing the ground for such a perception (Garibaldi himself was preceded by intellectual action on the part of several thinkers, including Mazzini, who helped spread the idea of Italian unity) and capable of effectively eradicating the Kremlin's propaganda; secondly, would it not be a little too much to ask Zelensky, already the leader of a people invaded by a great power, to take the whole of Europe on his shoulders?",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 08:54:56

First, when I talked about European values, I was simply quoting the values that are already mentioned in official EU documents. Firstly, I should (indeed) have said that these values are not universal in themselves, but that they are seen as such by those who identify with them (I think this stems from monotheistic universalism): they would lose much of their normative value if they were seen as particular rather than universal values.


On the second point, it is true that freedom is one of the founding values of the USA, but it is not a merely abstract and intellectual freedom: it is a freedom embodied in a story (in this case the American Revolution) that is capable of arousing emotions. If we look at European history, we find a similar case in France: 'Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©' are fundamental values of French identity, but they are also embodied in a revolutionary and emotionally charged history. For European unity, the discourse is different: because it was a gradual and peaceful process (fortunately, of course), it lacked a moment capable of embodying European values through its narrative, and this is a limitation. We have not had a Robespierre on a European scale, fortunately or unfortunately. The European Parliament, although it was the first experience of extending universal suffrage beyond national borders, does not have the same emotional intensity as the States General. Unfortunately, Spinelli will not be remembered in the same way as Washington. The alternatives are two: either we make a revolution on a European scale (perhaps by convening a constituent assembly capable of giving the Union an effective federal structure) that can be told by future generations (I could be in favour of this, but it seems to me an impractical way to go at the moment), or we look for stories that have already happened, that can embody European values and make them emotionally connoted.


As for negative experiences, I don't reject them, but I don't think they are enough: although they have indeed been a driving force for European unity, I am afraid that they can only be so (precisely) in a negative sense. In short, negative experiences can tell us which paths we should never take again, but they cannot tell us what was the best part of Europe from which we should learn. Moreover, my text focused mainly on examples of intra-European and international solidarity, partly in order to construct an emotionally connoted narrative showing that love of country and Europeanism are not contradictory. With regard to your last criticism, which I fully understand, one of the reasons why I prefer to insist on stories rather than directly on values is that stories, by their very nature (but also, in this specific case, because of the diversity between the different European nations), are multiple and can hardly be reduced to a single totalising model. If we can maintain plurality, we may be able to avoid a European Mussolini.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 11:29:28

Already Aristotle, criticising the community of goods hypothesised by Plato, had stated that ""two things, more than any other, compel men to choose for themselves an object of their care and love: possession and affection"". Indeed, it is possible to believe that the existence of each one of us is immersed in selfishness and greed, and that only a strong emotion directed towards the common good can evoke in us a behaviour inspired by sacrifice; such an emotion, in order to have the necessary motivational drive, cannot have as its object a completely abstract entity, but needs ""something"" that is sufficiently concrete (or at least capable of being made so), sufficiently local and ours, to direct our feelings towards an object that is above individual greed and selfishness: that object is the nation. Indeed, compassion is capable of motivating altruism, but it must be rooted in concrete stories and images: not only the lives of the founding fathers of the nation, or the characteristics of the territory in which it is rooted, but above all the stories of struggle, full of suffering and hope. Patriotism, then, seems capable of giving greater strength to moral motivations, but it must be constantly subjected to critical examination, so that a virtuous dialogue can take place between moral principles and the specific type of emotion required. Patriotic sentiment is capable of arousing devotion and attachment because the idea of the nation - and perhaps the idea of Europe - is ultimately a narrative structure in which the narrative moves from the nation's past to a future yet to be built.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 08:10:23

It seems to me that you are confusing national pride with love of country (but the term 'patriotism' is indeed a bit vague).  National pride can have many aspects, and it also depends on how you understand the terms 'love of country' and 'pride in one's country': if you mean 'being proud of something that does not depend on one's own merits', it makes little sense, but it can make sense if you mean that one's nationality is partly constitutive of one's identity, and that it deserves a certain kind of commitment on the part of those who possess it.

To say that in Italy (I am talking about my country because I know it best) there were many patriots in the past (during the Risorgimento and the Resistance) who were able to sacrifice themselves so that the next generations could live in a free nation: we are the next generations and we have received this inheritance. Although we were born here by chance, we owe a debt of gratitude to the patriots who came before us: perhaps this is the source of the special pride I mentioned earlier. We should not focus on the achievements of the patriots of the past, but on their intentions, because the goal of their sacrifice was to enable the next generations to live in a free nation: since we are among the generations that follow them, we are part of the motive for their sacrifice, and therefore we are indebted, if not directly to the Fatherland, then at least to the patriots' love for the Fatherland.

Precisely because the fatherland may be partly constitutive of our identity, a patriot should be concerned with the moral flourishing of his country: a patriot capable of focusing on this would seek to work for a just and humane society at the national level, and would seek to ensure that his country behaves justly beyond its borders. Although he may wish to see justice and human solidarity in action around the world, the ethical patriot is capable of caring and working to ensure that his country is guided by these moral principles and values because he sees his moral identity as linked to that of his homeland: he may not therefore feel great pride in his country's worldly successes, but he would be proud of his country's moral behaviour if he had reasons to be so. His patriotism, however, could not help but translate into a critical approach to his country and his fellow countrymen: he would be called upon to subject them to a critical moral analysis, precisely because he is a patriot. It is not a question of believing that one is cooler than others just because one is European, but of loving Europe and striving for it to be true to the best version of itself.

In this sense, patriotism does not contradict cosmopolitanism, nor does it necessarily degenerate into mere competition: this is precisely why, in the previous text, I wanted to show the cosmopolitan tendencies of patriots, both intellectually (citing the visions of Milton, Robespierre and Mazzini, of whom no one can deny the love of the fatherland) and practically (see the stories of Podulak and Nullo). Having a ""local"" homeland does not prevent us from considering the whole world as our homeland and the latter as superior to the former. I would like to end with a quotation from Garibaldi: ""The man who defends his homeland or attacks another's homeland is only a pitiful soldier in the first hypothesis - unjust in the second - but the man who, becoming cosmopolitan, adopts the second as his homeland and goes to offer his sword and his blood to every people fighting against tyranny, is more than a soldier: he is a hero"".",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-12 21:27:27

In my opinion, the European sense of belonging should not be created by the imposition of a single model - God forbid! - but through the 'Europeanisation' of the national heroes of the various nations (in the same way that the municipal heroes of the various Italian cities were 'Italianised' by the propaganda of the Risorgimento, without losing their specificity) and through the acts of intra-European solidarity that have taken place throughout the history of Europe and the nations that make it up. This feeling, in addition to preserving the unity in diversity that is so dear to Europe, could develop and lead the European citizen to appreciate acts of intra-European solidarity between European countries that are not the same as his own, simply because they are between Europeans, because he himself is European.


I will try to give an example that concerns me to illustrate what I mean (I apologise in advance if I seem tactless, that is not my intention): Recently I happened to visit the capitals of three European countries that had suffered under Soviet occupation and, partly out of personal interest, I went to visit the museums that tell of this past.

To return to my text, examples of 'Europeanised' histories range from Cromwell's intervention on behalf of the Waldensians to the Baltic Chain (via 1848 and the anti-Nazi resistance). Indeed, I argue that there is a plurality of different ways of being European, and that this is a good thing: on the one hand, not all citizens and not all peoples are equal, and it is not possible to force everyone to follow a single virtuous model, since that would turn Europe into a dystopia; on the other hand, it is always possible that one aspect of one set of examples is better than another aspect of another set, but we need a plurality of examples in order to be able to discover, through reasoned comparison, what is the best way to be European in a given context.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 10:50:05

 Patriotism can indeed create a feeling of unity even when you have very opposed internal political beliefs. Showing that patriotism, while superficial to some (having lots of flags), does create a sense of combined unity. 

It's almost like you are saying in your society, ""we can agree to disagree, but we are all patriots. We all love our country.""

Firstly, I think that more European languages should be taught in schools, not just English and a few others: every European language should have the same dignity in Europe and the same opportunities to make its culture known across borders. Furthermore, the use of a common language - other than English, partly to escape the influence of the United States - could become a tool for forging a European identity and strengthening the sense of unity of the European peoples: if adopted by the EU institutions and spread in all spheres of European society, a neutral and easy-to-learn language (such as Esperanto) could promote the recognition of a common European identity beyond national differences. A European lingua franca could be the instrument to pursue the ideal of a Europe increasingly united in its diversity. If promoted at the level of the European institutions, it could then spread throughout Europe and lead all Europeans to recognise themselves in a single language: they would finally think of themselves as Europeans. Indeed, Esperanto could be a good proposal: it has no mother tongue, and learning it puts everyone on an equal footing, because everyone starts from the same level, from the fragment of our mother tongue that we can find in Esperanto. Moreover, the Paderborn method has shown that Esperanto is more propaedeutic than English for learning other foreign languages; it could even prove to be a valuable tool for learning English itself and take its rightful place among the international languages. Learning this artificial language could serve as a springboard for acquiring skills in other foreign languages. The realisation of Zamenhof's hope would probably have been achieved in a much shorter time if Esperanto had been introduced as a language to be learnt in school: this would have given children greater confidence in their own ability to learn languages, and would have put everyone on an equal linguistic and national footing, without favouring any country, unlike the study of a dominant language. It is true, however, that the project of a lingua franca may seem too ambitious at this stage. I wonder whether it is worth investing in research into the development of artificial intelligence translation capabilities, something that could be a ""European novelty"" (and consolidate our identity) if we act in time.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 09:09:19

There can be no national story without first a national identity. Although you could say they both originated from a national identity *and* strengthen it, in the end, there can never be a national story before a national identity.

The fact that you think nationalism can only be done from a positive example is exactly the kind of thing we should be wary for. Same with trying to invent stories to tell us what the right thing to do is. 

And although I understand your issues with making a supposedly universal value particular, you can still identify with valuing these things more or being the guardian of such values.

I think your summary is the most accurate of those published in this comment section. I have only one thing to add about artificial intelligence, because it could also have potential at the level of European identity. As much as I wrote this post in English, I am sceptical about its use as an 'international language': apart from clustering the Western world around American culture, this forces non-English speakers to invest far more resources in mastering English than English speakers, creating inequality of opportunity. This is why I became an Esperantist (amateur, for now): Esperanto actually has no native speakers, and everyone starts at the same level as everyone else, from the part of their native language that can be found in Esperanto itself. It is true, however, that the project of a lingua franca may seem too ambitious at the moment. I wonder whether it is worth investing in research into the development of artificial intelligence translation capabilities, something that could be a 'European novelty' (and consolidate our identity) if we act in time.


However, the implementation of the project I mentioned in the main article and the fact that the EU has a relatively short history remain to be discussed: I am aware that the example I am about to give is not the most ethical, but it is also true that it was effective. During the Wilson administration, the 'Committee on Public Information' was created, an independent agency of the US government set up to influence public opinion to support the United States in the First World War, particularly on the home front. In just over 26 months (from 14 April 1917 to 30 June 1919), it used every means at its disposal to generate enthusiasm for the war effort and win public support for America's participation in the war (it was theirs - if I remember correctly - that famous poster depicting Uncle Sam and the famous phrase 'I Want You for US Army'). Of course, he was criticised by many, but he made a lasting impression on the US business world (and beyond) with his ability to control public opinion on a large scale. With due respect to ethical differences, it is perhaps possible to imagine such an operation: one would have to gather experts of all kinds (philosophers, historians, psychologists, public relations experts, international relations experts, artificial intelligence experts, artists, etc.), draw up the project, hope to get EU funding (unfortunately, this is also necessary), and start propagandising in this sense by various means (it would be useful, for example, to tell the stories of 'European heroes' through TV series).

If anything I think a society works better without patriotism (But instead other sources of cohesion).

There is broadly speaking a huge lack of solidarity, at least in the German sphere. The main political discourse is just how to further cut down on unemployment benefits to force people into low wage jobs. It is just divide and conquer at it's finest because it is framed in a way that makes it seem as if it was actually in the workers interest to force people to work (Instead of it just pressing wages down by creating more supply in the labour market). Instead of your boss buying his 3rd Porsche it's some unemployed guy. Or it's just straight up dividing it on ethnic lines and the problem is some poor Pakistani family in which case you get to feel superior, because instead of being miserable and Pakistani you are miserable and German. I think instead of Patriotism solidarity is just way more important. I don't care whose hungry kids my tax dollars feed. An Austrian kid is no more deserving than a kid of any nationality. Maybe if we build a better society I can feel some pride or love for that but certainly not for some vague culture or lines we drew in the sand. In the first place convincing a German factory worker to have his tax dollars be spent in southern Europe will require to deconstruct patriotism and build solidarity.

It is also fine to have people in your country's history that you like and look up to, but I don't associate those ideas with my country and seemingly neither do many politicians. Frankly with how things are and how 30% of my country vote fascists into power, we could have a history of Saints and I would still not be able to feel any love or pride for my country, because it is frankly currently a shitshow. There are a few thinkers I like but I don't like them because they were my countrymen, but because I liked their ideas or I thought they did good. I don't feel the need to incorporate them into some national narrative about how great my country is, because I feel like for most thinkers I respect, my country does not live up to their ideas and I also think that they were way more than just countrymen. I rarely see people who proudly proclaim themselves patriots do good or have good ideas and they are in fact the ones who are the least sympathetic to their disadvantaged compatriots.

I don't think you are inherently a bad person if you are patriotic and I don't think it is necessarily bad but I also don't think we need patriotism and especially for cooperation, building solidarity is way more important. I think in a lot of cases patriotism can just be an obstacle to that, because in the end I want solidarity beyond Europe as I am a universalist. I do agree that we need a stronger EU to face modern problems, but I don't think we need patriotism to build that. (Not that it is necessarily harmful)

In this sense, it is certainly possible that for a patriot the fatherland is partly constitutive of his identity, but that is precisely why he should be concerned about the moral flourishing of his country: a patriot who is able to focus on this would try to work for a just and humane society at the national level, and would try to make his country behave justly beyond its borders. Even though he would like to see justice and human solidarity in action everywhere in the world, an ethical patriot is capable of caring and working to ensure that his country is guided by these moral principles and values, because he sees his moral identity as linked to that of his homeland: for this reason he may not feel great pride in his country's worldly successes, but would instead be proud of his country's moral behaviour, if he has reasons to be so. However, his patriotism would not fail to translate into a critical approach to his country and his fellow countrymen: he would be called upon to subject them to a critical moral analysis precisely because he is a patriot.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 07:35:33

In this sense, imagine that an oppressed people knows a tyranny and a martyr who is killed for the freedom of that same people: it is certainly obvious that the cause for which the martyr is to be sacrificed precedes the martyrdom, but it is also true that the fact that the martyrdom has taken place and the fact that it is told again and again can embody the cause and give it new life, which can lead others to fight for the same thing. Furthermore, the fact that martyrdom has embodied the cause can transform the cause itself, because it gives it an emotional connotation, a name and a face (that of the martyr): since we humans are extremely sensitive to stories (which often become the glue of a community), this allows the cause to take on characteristics that make it capable of moving the community and leading it to action.


As for my emphasis on the positive example, I think I should digress for a moment on my idea of patriotism. The fact is that solidarity needs an emotional force to be truly rooted. Aristotle, criticising the community of goods hypothesised by Plato, had already stated that ""two things, more than any other, compel men to choose an object of their care and love: possession and affection"". Indeed, it is possible to believe that the existence of each one of us is immersed in selfishness and greed, and that only a strong emotion directed towards the common good is capable of inducing in us a behaviour inspired by sacrifice; such an emotion, in order to have the motivational drive we need, cannot have as its object a completely abstract entity, but needs ""something"" that is sufficiently concrete (or at least capable of being made so), sufficiently local and ours, to direct our feelings towards an object that stands above individual greed and selfishness: that object is the nation.


Indeed, compassion is capable of motivating altruism, but it must be rooted in concrete stories and images: not only the lives of the founding fathers of the nation, or the characteristics of the territory in which it is rooted, but above all stories of struggle, full of suffering and hope. Patriotism therefore seems capable of giving greater strength to moral motivations, but in order for a virtuous dialogue to take place between moral principles and the specific type of emotion required, it must be constantly subjected to critical examination. Patriotic sentiment is capable of inspiring devotion and attachment because the idea of the nation - and perhaps the idea of Europe - is ultimately a narrative structure in which the narrative moves from the nation's past to a future yet to be built. In this sense, I remember Mazzini, in a letter to Karl Blind, saying that either in the manner of Metternich (I think he did not consider Austria to be separate from Germany) or in the manner of the peasants who in the 16th century claimed that the kingdom of God should be reflected as far as possible on earth (I think he was referring to Thomas M√ºntzer).


In fact, there are two ways of understanding national identity: one is inherently selfish and, by oppressing other peoples or ignoring its obligations to them, soon descends into petty nationalism and vice; the other, by proclaiming the right of all peoples to freedom, represents the better version of the nation. In the same way, we can choose to be Europeans by imitating our best fellow citizens who have managed to represent the best and most virtuous version of Europe. It is not a question of believing that we are cooler than others just because we are Europeans, but of loving Europe and striving to be faithful to the best version of itself: for this we need positive examples (it is no coincidence that I have included many examples from revolutions and the fight against tyranny).¬†


As for the rest, it seems to me that the idea of the USA as a promoter of world freedom was already expressed in an embryonic form by Paine (but I studied him centuries ago) in the context of the American Revolution.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 17:30:25

Nor do I agree that patriotism should simply be deconstructed: on the contrary, I believe it should be reconstructed on a different basis. Fatherland is too precious a word to be left in the hands of nationalists. To show what I mean, I would like to use a concept studied by the cognitive linguist George Lakoff, framing, or the ability to create a frame that serves our purposes: in political competition, defining the terms of an argument means winning the argument. Lakoff says that frames are the mental frameworks that determine our worldview: they cannot be seen or heard, but they make up what scientists call the 'cognitive unconscious', those mental structures that we cannot perceive through conscious introspection, but only through the effects they produce. However, since every word is defined in relation to an underlying conceptual frame, language can be seen as a spy for these underlying frames. Since frames are activated by language, Lakoff argues, if you wanted to change them, you would have to change the language in the first place: you would have to create a new way of speaking in order to create a new way of thinking. Reframing is not a simple process: to change frames, it is necessary to access the unconscious beliefs that already exist in the mind, make them conscious, and repeat them until they become part of political discourse. Moreover, many moral beliefs are unconscious, and we are mostly unaware of even the most deeply rooted ones: reframing will therefore involve bringing to light both the beliefs and the deeper cognitive modes.


Speaking of Europe, it is true that in a globalised world the nation-state is losing importance and political agency, and not a few scholars have identified regional actors (including the EU) as the political actors of this global future. On their own, nation states risk being swallowed up by the superpowers, and this is precisely why, in order to preserve their sovereignty, states should unite into something bigger and stronger: building European unity is a truly patriotic mission, but it is often not expressed in these terms. But can we not imagine how much such a discourse (""Europeanists are the true patriots, nationalists are the true enemies of the fatherland"") could appeal to that part of the population that is sensitive to the idea of the fatherland (and it is not a small one) and restructure in a new way the arguments that normally belong to the nationalists?",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-13 08:34:28

Now we barely have two, maybe three extra dialects and two extra languages, survived only due to their seclusion, either on the islands or the far corner of the country with great effort from the modern enthusiasts. A mere 300 years ago we used to have two pretty distinctive languages and the southern one slowly died out as the full translation of the Bible - the main way of learning to read - was done in the northern style. It is now the official language.

And the reason it changed was interconnection (not to mention forced unification from a ruling entity) - first it was printing press and books that encouraged everyone in the distribution radius to use the same language and mannerisms, then the newspapers, then telegraph, then radio, TV. Meanwhile the transportation got faster, the people you interacted with regularly came from further away and thus the slow homogenisation happened in the wider and wider radius. And has now exploded with the Internet. Your geographic location doesn't matter anymore.

Check out Kihnu or V√µro language. Both have survived thanks to extensive deliberate work to revive and cherish them. And it has needed multiple efforts over century to keep the cultural base alive and recorded and taught to children. Livonian language, once spoken by 30,000 people, is officially dead and is only taught in universities.

Firstly, I don't see anything too paternalistic about educating citizens by example (if I'm not mistaken, this is something that happens in most cultures in the world, at least from the point of view of theories that humans are storytelling animals). Secondly, I believe that 'state' and 'fatherland' are different entities: a homeland that does not depend on institutions, at least not in the first place. To put it another way, in my country (but I think this is the case in almost all of Europe), during the Nazi-fascist occupation, many of the partisans who fought (even if they had different political ideas) were driven by a genuine love of the fatherland (at least this is what comes out of the letters they wrote before their execution), but - precisely - directed towards the fatherland, not towards the fascist state they were fighting against.¬†


As for the state serving the citizens and not vice versa, I disagree, if only because the state is made up of the citizens themselves, and if the citizens do not make the state work, then it will no longer be able to serve the citizens. The problem with human rights is that today, when we talk about rights, we often think only of ourselves and of others as bearers of rights, without realising that if others are bearers of rights, then we have obligations towards them: the moment we believe that we have inalienable rights (even if only the right to life), it is not possible - in a world of freedom and equality of dignity - to claim to have these rights without proclaiming a duty on the part of others. I believe that the right of an individual does not exist without the duty of all others (except in a charter that no one respects): one cannot proclaim a right without proclaiming a duty. The right of others is my duty, but to do one's duty properly, one needs a strong emotional motivation.


Moreover, human beings are by nature social and interdependent, even at levels that we normally consider to be more individual. In this sense, the notion of the ""knowledge community"", according to which human beings have an innate tendency to share cognitive work, even on the basis of their respective competences, is very useful: in this view, the key to knowledge is a cooperation marked by the interdependence that binds human beings together, not the individual exercise of rationality (on which freedom is normally based). In reality, we do not really think on our own, but only through this great network that connects us to the minds of others: if everyone else were very irrational (I take this trait as an example, but - perhaps - the same argument could be used for any other trait), I too would be much less rational (and this would also affect my free will). It is necessary for everyone else to be rational in order for everyone to have the capacity to be rational: any idea of individual self-determination has its place and can only develop within the network of interdependence. In this sense, if one really wants to be free (and therefore free of masters), one must take into account the fact that no man is really free if he is surrounded by slaves. On the one hand, and this is perhaps the deeper problem, that person would not have the freedom to confront others and learn from confrontation: when John Milton demanded that he be given the freedom to know, to express himself and to discuss freely according to his conscience before any other freedom, he was absolutely right. However much this freedom underpins the sacred value of human individuality (for such freedom is necessary for its development), it could not take place if I alone were not subject to domination, censorship or manipulation, and everyone else was.


If I, formally free, were surrounded by slaves or irrational people, I would still be a prisoner of myself. I can only be a self-determining individual if I am not alone. That's why I can hardly imagine an idea of freedom that doesn't include a concept of fatherland (or 'community', if you don't like the word 'fatherland'): I can only preserve my freedom, my rationality and a thousand other characteristics of myself by preserving the rationality, freedom and every other characteristic of the community to which we belong. We citizens help to shape the community to which we belong, but it helps to shape us. Of course, this discourse can be extended from the fatherland to the whole of humanity as we become more and more globally interdependent and as the Internet connects our thoughts more and more: I would agree, and this is one of the (many) reasons why I am pro-European.


As for the rest, may I ask you if you distinguish between patriotism and nationalism?",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-14 08:54:07

However, it is a question I have raised in other ways. As much as I have written this post in English, I am sceptical about its use as an 'international language': in addition to clustering the Western world around American culture, it forces non-English speakers to invest far more resources in mastering English than English speakers, creating inequality of opportunity. This is why I became an Esperantist (amateur, for now): Esperanto actually has no native speakers, and everyone starts at the same level as everyone else, from the part of their native language that can be found in Esperanto itself. It is true, however, that the project of a lingua franca may seem too ambitious at the moment. I wonder about investing in research into the development of artificial intelligence translation capabilities, something that could be a 'European novelty' (and consolidate our identity) if we act in time (it would innovatively preserve unity in diversity). As for the rest, I think the tone you perceived on my part is more due to a linguistic problem: I think in my own language and then try to translate with the tools at my disposal (there's a reason why I mentioned the translation capabilities of artificial intelligence: not that I couldn't do it myself, but I'm damn insecure) and, given the topic at hand, I tend to focus more on content than on tone (thank you for pointing out the problem).

-Generally speaking, educating citizens is seen as something you do up to an age of around 18. After which, people are supposed to be able to think critically enough that you don't need to treat them like that. I think a concerted effort to 'educate' an adult populace is paternalistic. You place yourself above them. Assume that you know what is good and instead of interacting with them as an equal you grant yourself the role of educator. You can of course write works with the intent to inspire, but the way you speak of it comes across as very paternalistic.

-Although you are not wrong in stating that a state cannot support it citizens without its citizens supporting it. It is cyclical. But if you have to put one over the other, it's seems rather obvious that in the end the point of a state is to serve its citizens. That has to take precedence and be the most important thing.

-I think a proper motivation to do one's duty by one's fellow citizen is not something that could or should come from nationalistic fervor, but rather the internalized sense that this is what is moral and right to do. 

-I don't really know what you are trying to say in that third paragraph, nor how it relates to anything else. We do not think on our own? You mean because our way of thinking gets influenced by other people in childhood? Or do you mean some sort of more mystical ongoing thing? Despite how wordy you are, I still can't help but notice you often just make odd statements of fact of things that sure don't seem factual, and then continue to build far from there.

-I think any clear distinction between 'patriotism' and 'nationalism' to create some sort of 'good' and 'bad' version is a deeply flawed effort. In reality these are not distinct things. Nationalism is an odd animal, because it is so complicated morally. There are some ways in which it is good and beneficial to a society, but an excess of it, or it taking the wrong forms can have deadly consequences. It is an odd beast like that. Although I understand the desire to split it into a good and bad form, I think it's important to remember that even efforts of 'good' nationalism can go quite badly.",Liutasiun,2024-08-17 17:59:23

A problem I myself struggle with. You indeed are a philosopher. I can't help but notice naivety in some of your ideas - a random presumption that learning English is a disadvantage and finding Esperanto to be a solution for that. As someone whose native language *is not* Indo-European, I would dislike a deliberate choice for lingua franca to be based on it.

It also shines through your other idea - unified European identity. I might be misinterpreting it, but it seems you find current state of things messy and counterproductive and your solution is one where everyone is generally of the same mind and identity. It is a nice idea until you start to factor in People. The annoying wonderful entity that doesn't want to do what is ""correct"" but what it is used to. Not to mention If the solution doesn't take human nature into account and tries to sweep some of it under the rug, is it even a good solution? Again, I used to be like that but am slowly seeing the inhumanity of my ideals. I recommend Terry Pratchett's Discworld (especially the witches books and the watch), it often has villains who find humanity and individuals an obstacle to running things properly.

In the school sense, of course, the scholastic part of education ends with the end of compulsory schooling, but then there is still the problem of keeping citizens' attention and vigilance alive: this is no small problem, not least because abstentionism, dictated by inertia and laziness, is one of the worst enemies of democracy. It was not my intention to be paternalistic. It is possible that the tone you perceived on my part was due more to a linguistic problem: I think in my own language and then try to translate with the tools at my disposal, and given the subject matter, I tend to focus more on content than on tone. As for who comes first between the citizen and the state, I don't think it should be seen as a pyramid, but as a virtuous circle in which both sides have to work together equally for everything to work: the individual citizen is served by the state if and only if his fellow citizens serve the state. Every citizen is part of the community, so it is not possible to violate the right of one citizen without violating the community as a whole (otherwise that individual would be subject to arbitrary rule, and the mere possibility of the existence of arbitrary rule would be a threat to the community) and without the other citizens having a duty to stand up for the victim (every citizen is a common good of the community). Obviously - unfortunately - laws are not enough, but they need to be rooted in a set of social norms that entail praise for those who obey them or blame for those who do not, precisely to make laws work. As far as groupthink is concerned, the view was epistemic rather than mystical, focusing on the fact that our epistemic capacities play a predominant role in the formation of our reason, and that this plays an equally important role in the formation of our individuality and free will: the point is, however, that we humans have a natural tendency to divide the cognitive work within the group, and that when we think we rely not only on information in our own possession but also in the possession of others. That is why I believe that we could never really think if everyone else were not in the same position, because humans are interdependent animals: to preserve my rationality, I have to preserve that of my community. As for patriotism and nationalism, I think the difference between them is very similar to the difference between self-love and selfishness: Self-love does not exclude altruism or a sense of brotherhood, but selfishness does. I will try to give some examples (which I have already quoted in the main text) to explain what I mean. The first example that comes to mind is John Milton: his patriotism cannot be questioned, since he lost his eyesight in order to fulfil his duties to the Commonwealth (he had been given the task of defending the regicide of Charles Stuart against royalist propaganda from abroad). Doctors had warned him that he would lose the sight of even his one remaining eye if he continued to write, but the call of the fatherland was stronger than the advice of Asclepius: his is an example of total self-denial for the cause of the fatherland, but quite different from nationalism. Indeed, Milton had declared in 'The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates' that there was a bond of mutual friendship and brotherhood between man and man throughout the world, and that not even the English sea could separate them from this duty and relationship: Of course there is a still closer bond between comrades, neighbours, and friends, but, Milton asserted, he who kept the peace, to whatever nation he belonged, would be an Englishman and a neighbour; but if an Englishman dared to violate life and liberty, he would be no better than a Turk, a Saracen, or a heathen, for he believed that it was not the distance of place that created enmity, but enmity that created distance. As we move into the next century, we may recall that Robespierre (who, despite having to take extreme decisions in extreme situations, truly loved France) had proposed that the French constitution should recognise that different peoples should help each other as citizens of the same state, and that those who oppress one nation should be declared the enemies of all the others. The duty of international solidarity was recognised by Giuseppe Mazzini, who declared in the Act of Fraternity of the young Europe: ""Every unjust domination, every act of violence, every act of selfishness which is exercised to the detriment of a people is a violation of freedom, of equality, of the fraternity of peoples. All peoples must help each other to eradicate it"" and that ""humanity will not be truly constituted until all the peoples that compose it, having conquered the free exercise of their sovereignty, are united in a republican federation to direct themselves, under the empire of a declaration of principles and a common pact, towards the same end: the discovery and application of the universal moral law"". Mazzini's patriotism cannot be questioned: in exile in London, he had founded a school with the aim of rescuing and restoring dignity to those Italian children who had been forced by deceit to emigrate and live as slaves of their master, begging in the streets of London (at the end they were beaten with clubs if they earned little). The Italian patriot had personally gone to great lengths to raise funds for the school, but it was not as if he had much money with him: he had already been forced into exile, and what little money he received from home he gave either to the cause or to other Italian exiles. The economic difficulties took their toll on his health: in his letters he wrote of toothache and constipation, but also of depression. In all these cases (which I have mentioned because they were theoretically aware of it, but there were many others who expressed the same sentiment without making it explicit), the love of country, although strongly felt, was open to humanity as a whole and to the brotherhood of individuals and peoples, something that nationalist egoism is not and cannot be: I think the main difference lies precisely in this openness. I think that Garibaldi (another man whose patriotism cannot be questioned) felt the same way when he said: ""The man who defends his country or attacks another's is only a pitiful soldier in the first hypothesis - unjust in the second - but the man who, becoming a cosmopolitan, adopts the second for his homeland and goes to offer his sword and his blood to every people fighting against tyranny, is more than a soldier: he is a hero"".",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-18 20:58:14
"We need European patriotism, and we need it now.",679,2024-08-12 20:29:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/YUROP/comments/1eqog84/we_need_european_patriotism_and_we_need_it_now/,YUROP,"Whatever the reason, I am sorry to have contributed to your discomfort. As far as English is concerned, I was more concerned with the problem of linguistic equality, and it seemed to me that Esperanto was not the best possible solution, but the best among the solutions already available (also because, while maintaining an Indo-European structure, it constructed its vocabulary from idioms pre-existing not only in Latin and Romance languages, but also in Germanic, Slavic and even Japanese: the intention was truly cosmopolitan), but I believe that the introduction of artificial intelligence has changed the game. 

As for the rest, I understand your concerns, but I believe that a state institution must, by its very nature, be inhabited by a certain kind of individual in order to be solid (and each is institution-specific: what is required for a democratic republic is different from what is required for an absolute monarchy or a totalitarian state). We could call this quality 'civic virtue'. European institutions, like all others, need European citizens to possess this civic virtue in order to function. However, there is still much debate about the method by which it should be disseminated and about its content. With regard to the former, any form of coercion must be avoided, as this could make the virtue unpopular rather than promoting it. In this sense, an analysis of the attempt to create a virtuous society, first by the Puritans and then by the Jacobins, could be useful. In both the English and French revolutions there were revolutionaries who, inspired by a fervent religious faith, found themselves at some point in a position of power to attempt a certain kind of moralisation of society in this sense: Oliver Cromwell and Maximilien Robespierre.

Cromwell - who converted to Puritanism at the age of 30 - believed that the English were a chosen nation (analogous to Israel in the Bible) and that the course of England's history since the Reformation was an indicator of its special destiny (an idea already widespread at the time): Milton, for example, believed that England was destined to begin a new Reformation within the Protestant Reformation that had already begun). Such a belief was based on the Calvinist principle of God's elect, which applied not only to individuals but also to nations. Cromwell's view, however, did not identify the people of God with any particular religious sect; on the contrary, he believed that God's children were scattered in a number of different churches and therefore advocated a certain tolerance between different churches (in a letter to the Scottish clergy he echoed many of Milton's arguments in this regard). However, the decisions of Cromwell's government to crack down on vice and promote virtue within the Commonwealth were bitterly unpopular within the patriarchal borders, and even before the Protector's death the nation hoped to rid itself of compulsory virtue.

About a century and a half later, it was Maximilien Robespierre who put forward a project of moral regeneration aimed, among other things, at establishing a virtuous republic. Robespierre was a deist: although not without Christian fervour as a boy, he converted to the doctrines of Rousseau in his early twenties. Although he did not work for Christianity, he did not approve of the de-Christianisation brought about by the new atheistic fanaticism: he was against the idea of frightening bona fide superstitious people with a forced cure, as this would make people even more fanatical. Although he did not develop a deistic doctrine of the ""chosen nation"", some of his speeches contain references to the eternal Providence that would call the French people to re-establish the Kingdom of Liberty and Justice on earth and that would watch over the Party of Liberty: The cult of God, in the image that Robespierre created of him, coincides with that of justice and virtue (the very virtue that he himself had defined as the soul of the Republic and the pious altruism that confuses all private interests with the general interest). Perhaps this was one of the reasons why the Incorruptible proclaimed a national holiday in honour of the Supreme Being on 8 June 1794, claiming that the Supreme Being had entrusted France with the mission of great deeds and had given the French people the strength to carry them out. This vision survived a few years after the death of its promoter.

If one were to ask why such projects of political and religious regeneration, couched in a peculiar language of patriotism, failed to take root in either Cromwell's Commonwealth or Robespierre's R√©publique, one could point to the fact that they did not have time to take root. The problem is that it is difficult to establish a tradition effectively in such a short time. According to the communitarian philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, a living tradition consists of a discussion that extends through history and is embodied in society, and that is partly about the values that constitute that tradition. In this sense, I think it would be more effective if intellectual vanguards (philosophers, historians, psychologists, public relations experts, international relations experts, artificial intelligence experts, artists, etc.) could prepare the ground for such a sentiment precisely from existing traditions (which is why I speak of ""Europeanising"" the national heroes of different nations). Of course, they would have to draw up a sensible and coherent project, hope for EU funding (which is unfortunately also necessary) and start promoting it by various means (it would be useful, for example, to tell the stories of ""European heroes"" through TV series). At first it might be difficult to find the right vanguards and collect raw materials, but it would only be difficult, not impossible. It could be a way of creating a habit.

Moreover, it is a fact that we need citizens to ""feel"" Europe in order to make it work, but we also need citizens to know Europe in order to ""feel"" it: this is a necessary condition. How can you love Europe if you do not know it? For this reason alone, reducing European identity to a single model, instead of showing and telling the plurality of European histories, would be quite harmful, because it would not allow people to really know Europe and would create a patriotism towards a fatherland that does not really exist. On the other hand, this virtue required of Europeans must not be too demanding, because it would already generate hatred, so it must not forget to take into account human weaknesses: it must be balanced.

Thanks for the reading suggestions! I sign everything! In any case, yes, I have thought about these issues (perhaps too much) and I am happy to discuss them with you, also because a good debate with those who think differently is certainly enriching: at best it allows one to get closer to the truth, at worst it allows one to consolidate one's arguments on the matter.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-14 13:27:08

It is but natural as authoritarian leaders often rely on supposed virtues and moving towards them to excuse their brutal methods. It is also why I find your position naive - both situations you describe ignore what people at that point believed and identified with, didn't understand how they came to that point and what were the advantages of those beliefs and identifications. They only cared about their idea of what is ""correct"" and the rest of the society was forced to play along or suffer (which they did anyways).

It is what I also find lacking in your ponderings - you don't seem to take into account why we are where we are at this moment and why it is/was useful. It is also why the recent movements of radical feminism have been mostly rejected by the society as it ignored why the current system, flawed as it may be, ended up here.

If I were to argue your case, I'd rather use the 18th-19th century Enlightenment movements for ""how to create/modify a social identity"", although their goal was somewhat the opposite to yours - creation of nation states, division into differently identifying entities across Europe. But by looking into how and why these ideas took root and started competing against the idea of Empires, you could find some ideas how to, after arguing the need for bigger base entities move towards a unified Europe.",ops10,2024-08-14 14:07:33

In fact, I believe that a different method should be used: the example I am about to give is atrocious from an ethical point of view, but useful in explaining the error of the Puritans and Jacobins. The philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky asks us to imagine a frog immersed in a pot of cold water that is slowly heated. The frog will find the heat pleasant at first, but then it will increase to the point of boiling the poor frog: the fact is that if the same frog had been plunged directly into the boiling water (the mistake of the Jacobins and Puritans, to be clear), it would have jumped right out of the pot. Of course, I am not suggesting that the European people should be boiled, not least because - whereas those who could control the frog were those who had power over the fire - European democratic civilisation is also (thankfully) founded on democracy and the free flow of ideas, which means that others could 'turn down the heat'. To use a less terrible metaphor, the drop digs the stone: habit is the basis of everything. As for the rest, the ideas I put forward in the main article are in fact mainly based on romantic observations: that is, my reflection on European unity as the only way to preserve the political agency of citizens is mainly based on Giuseppe Mazzini's reflections on the role of nations, and my insistence on European heroes is based on the way in which the communal heroes of the various Italian cities of previous centuries were Italianised during the Risorgimento. It must also be said that since my homeland was once made up of warring states and was united by the idea of the nation, I cannot believe that European unity is really at odds with nations.",Material-Garbage7074,2024-08-15 15:30:59

On the site they also seem to have 13C so maybe that works) are unlikely to shade match for very pale, especially with non-warm undertones (you can actually see this in influencer videos, if you look at the picture not just listen to voiceover - and if video goes past initial application...) But at least it has testers, so definitely try those. It can certainly be made to work if you contour/highlight heavily, but it will take an effort.

Good coverage and lovely finish, so as long as shade matches and one doesn't have enough fine lines to worry about foundation settling in those lines.  It's a fantastic base for powdery contours/eyeshadows/blushes, so the fame is not unearned.


Clio kill cover suggested by another poster matches very pale skin better,  but coverage of kill cover founwear (what I use and what's their highest coverage cushion) is quite a bit more lighter (or let's say - more medium) than tirtir red.

Your part about fusion is interesting to me. I agree with most of what you said, especially the part about the influence of food media.

Ultimately, restaurants are a buyer's market. You can make an inspired menu with some really good fusion dishes on there, but a question is: are people going to want to eat it? Most people dont go out to eat to have a new experience, they go out to just have a good meal. What that means for most people is they are going to order what they know. And I dont blame them - restaurants are expensive, and blowing $30 on something you dont like sucks.  So they order the chicken dish, or a steak, because they know that's gonna be good no matter what. But when every customer takes the safe choice vs branching out, that leads to those more adventurous menu items to get taken off because you are wasting too much product.

It also largely depends on location. For example, at my last job, we couldnt put *anything* spicy on the menu because the people in that area just wouldn't order it. It was a more upper class crowd and they liked French-influenced American comfort food, upscale bar food, and fish dishes. My chef wanted so badly to make the place more inspired by his Texas roots and ditch the whole ""upscale bar food"" scene.  but he couldnt because  that's what people wanted.

The vast majority of chefs arent celebrities. They cant get people through the door just based on their name. It's a constant struggle between doing what you want to do and doing what will sell in your market. So you have tons of brilliant chefs that have great ideas, but they are limited by the customers who want to walk into any restaurant and order a burger or steak and potatoes.",[deleted],2020-02-08 14:23:19

I had some scattered thoughts on the historical piece on the relationship between the decline of home cooking and the semi-mythical (more on that in a sec) entry of women into the workforce at midcentury: During the entire modern period prior to WWII, large majorities of women worked, either in the home for money or outside the home entirely. From cottage industry to agricultural work to domestic service to conventional wage labor in factories and shops, the masses of poor and working class women participated in the broader economy and weren't necessarily housewives in the way we envision that role today (a woman whose work is solely domestic and whose husband earns the household's money). Though cooking and other domestic duties fell to women rather than men, poor and working class women performed those tasks for their families in addition to money-earning labor. 

Until the outbreak of WWII, the vast majority of upper and middle classes of women who did not participate in the broader economy and who were therefore free, at least theoretically, to devote themselves to cooking employed servants who handled the bulk of food preparation.  While today live-in in help is the province of the super-rich, it used to be routine for solidly middle class households to have a hired girl. At the turn of the 20th century, for instance, more than 20% of households in Chicago had at least one live-in servant. However, when WWII rolled around, the domestic service industry collapsed because wages for hired girls sucked in comparison to wages in war industries. And the booming postwar manufacturing economy meant that working class women did not need to go back to their poorly-paid posts in wealthier women's households, because they could continue to find better-paid work outside of service.  

So, contrary to popular belief, in the industrializing/industrialized West prior to WWII, women who cooked for their families largely did so despite the time constraints of paid labor that were similar to the time constraints faced by working women today. Consequently, married women's *nonproductive* time or lack thereof was not the driving force behind changes in food preparation patterns. Nor was the operative shift women in general entering the workforce (since most of them had already been there). Nor was it even the entry of middle class women specifically into the workforce (since middle class women had not previously been responsible for the majority of food preparation).  Instead, IMO, it was the *exit* of working class women from the domestic service industry-- an industrial realignment-- and, even more fundamentally, the culmination of a broader transition away from an agriculturally-based economy to a consumer one.  

So what's my point? The conventional narrative is that feminism and the microwave conspired to kill home cooking sometime in 1960, but I'd say that home cooking and traditional foodways in general were slowly strangled by industrialization and urbanization themselves, and those processes go back centuries.

Whew, I dunno. I'll stop there.",watekebb,2020-02-08 21:57:09

It sucks that you have to go through this, but it's admirable how you're trying to make the best out of a terrible situation. I've been following your instagram posts, and most of the time my first reaction is 'I've never seen that before'‚Äîfollowed by a trip to my closest Asian market on the next day.

I think that's one of the biggest strengths of your channel and posts: You inspire passionate hobby cooks like myself to try new ingredients and techniques, even if the entire recipe or dish isn't the goal itself. I look at many ingredients way differently compared to like 5 years ago.

Anyway, I hope your situation improves, and that you get access to fresh vegetables again. I wouldn't mind a few more entirely vegetable-focused videos either. ;)

My impression is that too much of Chinese cuisine is falsely portrayed (in the West, at least) to be meat-centered while you actually have so many unique ingredients that can entirely shine on your own. I recently browsed through Omnivore's Cookbook's [introduction to Chinese greens](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-greens/), and it's astonishing how much of that basically doesn't exist here.

After following a lot of your posts it's interesting to read what you're thinking about during all this.

Some thoughts on ""good food starting in 1750"":

Our iconic dishes may date from the past 2 centuries, but I suspect that's an artifact of who created the modern food scene and defined ""classic"" (like how ""classic"" Christmas songs [are basically the songs from boomers' childhood](https://xkcd.com/988/).

There's a good chance you've read up on food history more than I have (almost certainly for Asian food), but the reading I've done in Western cookbooks from different eras shows plenty of good food predating 1750. It just isn't part of modern canon. I've found good, simple dishes from *Apicius* (ancient Rome) and *To the King's Taste* (14th century England). *Now I'm curious about how far back typical Moroccan dishes go (I can't get enough of tagines).*

Lots of flavors traveled the world before the Columbian era you mentioned - Rome had huge reach in its day, and the crusades brought many flavors back to the Christian West.

Methods and tools may have been refined through the past couple hundred years, but delicately flavored, well-balanced, and well-executed dishes are nothing new. It's easy to see our current state as the peak of progress in any field, but so many artisanal fields have had terrifically skilled and innovative practitioners for so many centuries that it's unlikely that cooking started seeing such progress so recently.",chairfairy,2020-02-08 15:05:24

First of all, good luck on your current situation. It must suck and it's quite admireable to pull creativity out of it. I agree with you that limitations and scarcity produce creativity. I also think you are overthinking it a bit.

There are plenty of recent recipes that have become popular. Think about the modernist cuisine. Or here in the Netherlands we have something called ""kapsalon"", which is basically a dish of fries, doner, lettucie, tomato and cheese put in an oven that has taken the country by storm. People are inventing all kinds of hamburgers. The vegetarian community is inventing all kinds of plant based food to accomodate the lack of meat. There are tons of new ingredients available to us and you see people everywhere use them and incorporate them in different classic dishes. The reason why you don't see many dishes become popular and iconic this way is that there are simply too many of them. There is so much variation, and so many techniques and combinations that work well that it's impossible to put a name to it. 

I mean what is a popular dish anyway? It's just a series of techniques that someone liked at one point and gave a name to, with enough other people liking the idea and carrying on with that. On one hand you have Minestrone, which can basically be a soup with anything in it. On the other you have Carbonara, which should have a number of very specific ingredients to be called as such (according to Italians anyway). Nowadays we have so many possibilities that these dishes don't get the chance  and time to form and create an identity. Plus, a lot of the best ideas have already been found so the frequency of finding something brilliant also goes down. 

Also that line about the OEDC countries really wasn't necessary. We all have good food, and we all have bad food. Nobody is more enlightened than the other. ;)",psgels87,2020-02-08 15:18:39

Chongqinger here - sorry about the situation there! Shortages lasted about a week here but then they figured out supply chain and stores were able to keep stock - the only thing that's been gone is onions, and I've replaced that (kinda) with leeks, xiaocong, and jiucai, which are all in stock.

The panic buyers did buy up all the rice and flour (and I guess like all the onions too?) for a bit, I was only able to secure a 25kg sack of flour from a wholesale supplier, way too much for me to need. Full quarantine here starts monday - I guess it will be a lot of bread and noodles for the next few months...

Glad you're doing ok. Your thoughts have captivated me all day, and I just wanted to put my two cents in.

I feel a big decline in modern cuisine is the simple fact that some (not going to say most, I don't know the numbers) just simply do not know how to cook.

Take me for example. I was never taught how to cook (was able to use microwave and toaster that was it). Even in my teenage years I was **not** allowed in the kitchen when my mom was making dinner. I was also not allowed to use the oven, stove, etc. Just the microwave and toaster. Everything I know how to cook now came after living with her. 

Because of the fact that I was disallowed to do any real cooking until after I left home, I have low confidence in my cooking in general. I hate to rely on box and already prepped dinners, but so far a slow cooker is the one device I feel the most comfortable with using, and even that has it's limitations.

Another example, my mother-in-law. She was born just after the Great Depression in america, and was a young girl during WWII. She was an only child who was raised on a farm, and instead of learning to cook with her mother or grandmother she was often busy helping out with the farm (had both livestock and grew food). As my mother-in-law got older, her own mother also disallowed her to cook in her own home. My mother-in-law has spoken about how she never really learned basic housekeeping (mending clothes, cooking, etc) because her father usually kept her busy in the fields, and when she had free time she was either too worn to have her mother teach her anything, was playing with her friend down the street, or was busy attending church (**very** religious upbringing).

So, not only did I, myself, never learn, but my mother-in-law never did either. My mother-in-law regrets never learning how to properly cook, because her mother did most everything herself (which brings me to my next point).

I feel a good chunk of us (at least americans, and again not at all saying all), just simply do not know how to do the basic things with cooking. We aren't really taught how to growing up, and we reach for the convenient already made products because it takes a lot of work to learn how to properly (and safely) do a lot of things.

Examples of what I mean is this. Canning. There's a lot you need to know about the safety of canning. If you aren't raised with it (like me), it's pretty intimidating to attempt to try canning, while also seeing all the risks of having the correct ingredients, temperatures, etc with canning.

Another example is making homemade sauces and condiments (and how to properly store them). Making and storing fermented items (saurkraut as an example, my mother-in-law grew up having homemade saurkraut fermenting in their cellar, but she only vaguely knows how it was made because she helped prepped the cabbage but was kept out of the rest of the process). 

Homemade stocks! Boy that sounds like one of the easier things to do yet *I personally don't know a single person that has ever attempted to make their own broth or stock!* 

My long-winded tangent is this... I know I am not the only person who was raised without knowledge of how to do basic cooking or storing of some sort. Because my mother-in-law was not allowed to cook, and later on learned on her own outside of the home, a lot of cooking techniques, history, and recipes from her own family have been lost, and therefore is unable to pass on what should be basic things.

Having started out at such a disadvantage, neither me nor my mother-in-law are comfortable expanding beyond what we know to cook. I am trying, but it's intimidating. 

That being said, how many people are just not being taught how to cook, and instead of learning, are just reaching for the easy convenient things because the idea of sitting down to cook a fully prepared meal sounds like too much work. We sit and watch videos and read recipes hoping to attempt the same, but we see so many steps that intimidate us, let alone ingredients we are unfamiliar with.

My husband learned how to cook from his dad. My husband is a wizard and is somehow able to cook a meal without needing a recipe. I could throw him a new ingredient and he'll figure out how to make it taste good. I can't without a recipe. Not saying everyone taught to cook as a child can cook without a recipe, but my husband has that ability and it's an intimidating idea to me lol.

I hope I didn't lose you anywhere, but I do feel a big reason why the art of cooking (the modern cuisine) is lacking as it is may be part that the knowledge of how to do things isn't passed down as it had in the past (before the internet, before our everyday conveniences). Therefore we have the option to either teach ourselves to cook, or find the few things we're comfortable with making and find convenient foods the rest of the way.

Another aspect is also money. If you don't know how to cook, the idea of buying a lot of ingredients for something you're not sure you can pull off (or will even like) versus the easy cheap dinners that you know you like and never straying from that also play a part.",theladycrimson,2020-02-09 04:30:44

Maybe throw in some leftover meat and pickles?

--------------------------------------------------

As for your write-up, I have been thinking and having some similar thoughts about food. The scarcity argument is an interesting take. I have come to different conclusions however, that might make you feel better (or maybe even worse). 

There are plenty of new dishes being made everyday - some of them ingenious, but most of it trash - and the reason they just don't see the light of day is because something just randomly sticks. Either a gatekeeper (food critic, celebrity, popular head of state, influencer, etc...) says that something is amazing, all of a sudden everyone wants to have a piece of it. There are incredible dishes being made everyday at restaurants, specifically those that command excessive premiums to have the privilege to eat there, that push out amazing dishes every day. And there are hundreds, maybe thousands of these around the world. Not to mention that even your local, neighborhood restaurant might include an ingredient, a little technique or entirely new mash-up that its only day of glory is that it ends up on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives. This is everywhere around the world! Do these dishes get the recognition that they deserve? At least a nod of the head of the extraordinary ingredient used or novel cooking technique? No! If they do, it is from the food obsessed like you and I, and if we serve it to even our closest friends and family - its a mere shrug of the shoulder. Instead, you have a place that serves salad for $15 a bowl infecting major metropolitan areas everywhere. There certainly isn't anything interesting or novel about those.

I don't know why the Mona Lisa is so revered, or why Andy Wharhol was able to make Cambell Soup cans in to art, but I can tell you why Korean Budae Chigae or BBQ Chicken Pizza came to prominence. Could others not so food literate say the same? I don't know if scarcity has a say as to why episodes 4, 5 and 6 are master pieces but the prequels were outright disasters. What I think scarcity has going for it is that people's opinion change about food. I want Carbonara but I don't have fresh cheese, milk, eggs or guanciale. I do have condensed milk, salted duck eggs, nutritional yeast and spam though. If I served this to a world where Carbonara is only Carbonara if an Italian says it is, did you innovate or did you make it wrong? In a non-food scarce world ""ITS WRONG! IF MY GRANDMA HAD WHEELS!"" At times of food shortage and need of comfort, where one is trapped in the apocalypse, this might be the best Carbonara ever. If it is, it sticks with you. You make it over and over. You have a story that you want to tell. It isn't ""Look at my amazing dish! Aren't I so creative!"" Its an extension of the story you want to tell; the part of hardship you had. You are literally sharing your self with a dish like this. If it is tasty, and the right person understands what you did, and declares this dish is a masterpiece, then all of a sudden you might think that our over-abundance of food is closing people's minds!

I disagree as well. What of Ignacio Anaya? The dude literally threw cheese on tortillas with a pickled jalapeno and now the dish is served in every god forsaken bar in the United States.  You might say, that the scarcity of not having anything else to serve a voracious band of military wives was the reason, but I am pretty sure he just wanted them to have a plate of STFU. Instead, it backfired and they all went back home and gabbed on and on about how amazing fucking cheese on chips is. Is this an ingenious dish? If someone spent all of their culinary training in the world, trying to concoct all sorts of amazing, innovative dishes and then what makes one famous is cheese on fucking chips. I don't think scarcity has anything to do with that one. Sometimes, you know a piece of shit when you see it, but when someone labels it art and all of a sudden everyone says it is too, you start to wonder...what is art after all? 

Food is just there to nourish us. I don't think many folks care as much as we do.  A lot of people say food is a labor of love. We do it because we want to nourish others souls. In turn, it nourishes ourselves. Sometimes it is just something you assemble together in haste to get something into their mouths so they STFU and then they won't shut up about what they just ate. I have come to the opinion that, much like art, food culture is a crap shoot. In times of scarcity, folks might be more open to a change of ingredients, but that isn't necessarily to say that there aren't amazing dishes being made every day when food isn't scarce. I'd say the opposite. I'd say it is impossible to strip the signal from the noise. And of those dishes that do, they never ever get the recognition that they deserve. If we are to believe that the culinary arts are indeed an extension of art, this is the only rationale I can think as to why certain dishes make it to prominence. I don't really feel like anyone is really to blame either. Food critics do an amazing job of trying to highlight what is amazing, new and innovative dishes everyday and many of the recommendations, even if we read about it, fall to the noise. I might know what makes a great dish to my taste, but I think for everyone else, it is still a mystery. It ends up being one of those ""I knows it when I [tastes] it.""

Anyway, that's my thoughts on innovation of food. We ARE innovating everyday, but no one notices. It might be a bit too cynical, but it is also a bit more freeing. As long as we are passionate about food because we love it, inevitably, we may have our own moments. We will continue to work and create because we love it; not because we want the next great American franchise. What it requires is work and dedication, and maybe one day, after slaving over a weekend or just throwing some shit together last minute, someone might just appreciate our pi√®ce de r√©sistance, whether its a centerpiece of our life story as the food obsessed or just cheese on chips.

The trade-off in my situation is that I ensure the house is taken care of, stocked, and hot meals are ready by the end of the day (I have my complaints, but I'm a mom. I think that's a norm hah). I went from being very intimidated to having grown very fond of cooking. I have this wish brewing where I could learn home cookery from different cultures.

I love your assessment if modern cooking!! I completely agree with all of your points <3

Another item is the overabundance of grossly unhealthy ingredients, leading to a changing in the general populations tastes. For example, over the past few decades, healthy foods were slowly selected less commonly by the public, in preference of sugary foods, so now most of the healthy or lower sugar foods have ""died out due to competition"".

The restaurant that serves foods with a rich history and tradition, an emphasis on true culinary health and creativity (rather than trendy, ""healthy"" pandering), and reasonable food choices will be slightly less profitable because a majority of their customer base's tastes are corrupted.",Discoverthemind,2020-02-09 01:15:31

I read it all, and it‚Äôs one of my favorite Reddit posts for some time. I‚Äôm sorry that your city is going through this terrible time. I‚Äôve never experienced anything on that scale, though I understand exactly what you mean about ‚Äúadjusting to the new normal‚Äù as my part of California does that whenever wildfires fill the air with toxic smoke for weeks. It‚Äôs crazy how sudden the shift is. 

Your exploration of food history was especially interesting to me. I run a [French history podcast](http://www.thelandofdesire.com) and I‚Äôve had numerous episodes about the development of French cuisine and restaurant culture. One thing of note is that the traditional French ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù as a social construct - as in, the radical notion that you would go outside your home to eat, in public, food cooked by a stranger, when your own home and kitchen is nearby - emerges out of a weird diet fad. To apply that candle box way of thinking, if you break down ‚Äúdiet fad‚Äù into ‚Äúartificial constraint around what you eat‚Äù it starts to become clear yeah? The fad in question is bouillon, just that simple clear broth. ‚ÄúRestaurant‚Äù is rooted in the idea ‚Äúto restore‚Äù - as in, to restore one‚Äôs health with fortifying broth. Well, there‚Äôs only SO much you can do with bouillon, and what there is to do with it, French chefs of the 18th century did. So you‚Äôve got a bunch of competing restaurants emerging for the first time, fighting in a slow motion death march over who can produce the absolute best, most healthful, restorative, premium meat liquid for public consumption. Eventually you start to reach the limits of what you can do with broth so they use other methods to differentiate themselves, which are familiar to us today: fancy menus, elegant dining rooms, etc. 

Not really leading this to any big conclusions, just thought you might find that interesting. This was a terrific bit of writing, I hope you seriously consider submitting it for publication somewhere.",[deleted],2020-02-09 19:54:40

There would be times where sometimes mayo and tortillas was all we had and that was what we had to eat. 

Hardly anything I make nowadays is to follow an exact recipe (unless it's Mama's food but I mean, that's a given) and more just grab inspiration from what tastes I like and what ingredients I have. Every now and then I'll buy an ingredient I've never heard of or seen before and try to either substitute a similar mouth feel or taste or see if I can combine it into an existing dish I make.

Though I've often considered myself hypocritical when my coworkers bring ""Mexican Lasagna Bake"" to a work potluck but I mean, to feed 20 people, a casserole dish seems the smartest thing to do rather than making a breakthrough culinary fusion.

But it's still boring. Adding some very typical taco ingredients into a lasagna and calling ""Mexican Lasagna"" is... oddly disturbing and offensive to me. Mixing foods out of laziness yet still getting props in a very Karen hivemind setting... I'm not sure where my line of thinking stands or if I can find justification for it but this post has helped a decent amount.

Necessity is the mother of invention was it? I wonder truly where our world would be if, just for a day, a week, some amount of time- everyone had to scrape by. Not only in the culinary world but in general.

I think food ingenuity slowed down because the world has shrunk. We do have every vegetable at our finger tips. It is like the english language has 26 letters - no one needs to invent anymore. There is no one going 'this mango will change the world'. Things like molecular gastronomy are still being developed into cool recipes, though sadly they're often plays on older recipes from what I've seen.

I think part of the slow down is also a feeling of being beholden to the old ways. I watch your channel and several others to learn about chinese cooking techniques. The ingredients however are outside of my reach (i'm on a tight budget all the time, so it's similar to general food scarcity). Basically any recipe that calls for fresh meats I have made with cured ham or smoked sausages because I can get it and it's cheap. I've made char shui a couple of times...but with bacon because it was in my price range (if you get a chance to try it, I recommend it. Thick cut bacon turns into this fatty, semi-jerky in the oven). I have foodie friends - the kind that DO think themselves good cooks - and they scoff at my adaptations. A great example is the visceral, knee-jerk reaction i get from everyone when I tell them I don't put red kidney beans in chili and use other beans instead, usually chick peas/garbanzo beans. It's like sending a declaration of war! And that is a substitution I have to make because my kid can't eat kidney beans!

So if the inventive-by-circumstance cooks are being crushed down by food snobs, there is no will to make new foods. Also, the home cooks are being inventive but no one besides their spouse, kids, and maybe a few close friends will ever taste those new flavours. 

On the topic of scarcity and things to do with carrots - For you specifically, take your thinking back to the West and throw in some fusion. I hope these don't come off as condescending, I really don't know what you have or haven't thought of but wanted to offer a variety of thoughts. If not for you, maybe they'll help someone else. 

-steamed or boiled carrot pieces (circles or medium length sticks) but serve it with any spicy sauce concoction as a side dish with rice

-mashed carrots with cumin. I forget which region serves the two together, but it would go great paired with lamb or anything else you're already putting cumin on. You could also go sweet/spicy and add honey & chilies, might also go with some toasted peanuts, too. Depending on your access to them, you can also do blended mashed root vegetables. It's not something I have heard anyone else do but myself. I do it all in one pot adding in the vegetables as the cooking time moves along.

-carrot cake - there are lots of variations on it, I am sure you can pick one that you like. Maybe do 50/50 rice & wheat flours then steam it for a sticky bun effect then go ham with more condensed milk? You could also add a bunch of spices, so it's more of a spice cake with carrot. 

-sneaking shredded carrots into anything in place of sugar. My exhusband was diabetic so this was something I did often. It takes the bite out of acidic tomato sauces and adds body when cooked down into stews and curries. The idea is to get it super fine so it breaks down during cooking. 

-freezing up & saving broccoli stems. They freeze pretty well, so you can save up the stems until you have enough to make a whole separate meal out of without forcing them into the same dish that has the florets. 

-if you get your hands on a surplus of fresh anything, look into making quick pickles. Vietnamese style is pretty straight forward. If you want to try some more crazy pickle making, Nukazuke or any of the other Japanese style pickles (they take their pickles very seriously!).

-fresh italian pasta. Since you've got time and flour it could be fun doing that sometimes. As I mentioned earlier, I do a lot of substitutions. Doing stir fries with italian style pasta is different, but not bad. It could be fun to break up the monotony. 

I hope any of that helps.
Good luck to you two and everyone else out there :)",Sheanar,2020-02-13 20:14:34

I always look forward to your posts, and I was hoping you were doing okay!

You hit on something interesting with the idea that cooking with constraints can lead to more creativity. There is definitely a shift in mindset from ‚ÄúI want to cook XYZ dish‚Äù to ‚ÄúI need to figure out how to use what I have.‚Äù 

Since you mentioned restaurant dishes, I want to engage with the idea that our thinking about what constitutes a meal has become all cattywompus. 

Back when people were growing more of their own food and living subsistence lifestyles, I doubt they focused on named dishes the way we do now. If the larder had a cut from a hog butchered earlier that year and some potatoes, they would just eat pork and potatoes. 

For most of human history, you couldn‚Äôt just go to the specialty store to get tamarind paste and experiment with Pad Thai. The variety of what‚Äôs available would be unthinkable to a person living a couple hundred years ago. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs all to say that I‚Äôve become more interested in traditional foodways these days. I‚Äôm hoping 2020 is the year I successfully grow tomatoes. I‚Äôm finally getting into canning. And I‚Äôm trying to shop my fridge first to avoid food waste, even though I have the luxury of being able to afford whatever I want.

McCaffrey shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. ""Can I subdivide the current part further?"" If yes, do so. ""Does my current description imply a use?"" If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word ""wick"" implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since ""string"" implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since ""interwoven fibrous strands"" does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.‚Äù

Second off, love your write up.

What you say about modern fusion definitely is largely true. There are huge exceptions of course, as with everything, but... Yeah.

I feel like modern fusion tries to distill flavours either into black and white or way too cleanly ""round...""

I'm no food historian but I can obviously see how that comes as a reactionary movement to way-too-decadent-and-nouveau 80s and 90s trendy cuisine, but as you said a lot of it has turned into a 'literary' understanding of fusion or even just various cuisines... Like... They get the brains and the bones, but avoid the skin and the teeth... If that makes sense.

Also, given your environment... Have you considered going really weird with it? There are some strange inter- and post-war dishes perfect for times of shortage, as well as plenty of Americanized and European (especially Eastern European) foods that seem good for the environment you are in - a few ingredients are all over the place, but others are just absent, randomly...


Or maybe trying some really old-school Western dishes to feed your fiance and family, to gauge their reactions?

I grew up in an extremely rural area, far from the madding crowd.  So our larder and freezer and cellar were mostly well-stocked, but the fresh veg thing holds so true.  We could not grow enough on limited rain, so our reliance on a monthly grocery trip‚Äôs finds sought to maximize their use.

The points you make about fusion cuisine ring true to me.  Successful fusion, in my experience comes from necessity.  A culture cut off from their normal/preferred ingredients making do with substitutions available.  The Viet-Cajun that popped up in Houston and Dallas post-Katrina, for example.

I appreciate the thought you put into this post, and while I don‚Äôt necessarily agree on all your points, the approach of seeing a meal in a cupboard others would throw their hands up at us dear to my heart and has, repeatedly, born new dishes/recipes that were so successful they became staples.

Regarding the specific problem of people ordering the 'safe bet' - this is why I think the Chinese style of eating is completely awesome. Have a few friends? Order ~6 dishes. Three can be safe things everyone likes. Two can be things that maybe some people love, but maybe other don't so much. One can be the ""chef's recommendation"" that the waitress pushes on you. You get more variety, there's way less ""order envy"". Incidentally, I think this is also the same reason why people love appetizers when they go out, and why tasting menus are a thing in fine dining.

Paella is an interesting example. (Primary source is just Wikipedia FYI, so small grain of salt and all that). Going back to the Middle Ages, rice and fish was a popular dish in coastal Spain, especially during lent. Then in the 1700s in Valencia, the dish started to take shape - being cooked outside in its distinctive pan, with water vole being the main protein in it. 

In 1840, it was the first recorded time of people using the word ""Paella"" to refer to the dish rather than the pan. The dish continued its evolution throughout the mid 19th century, with chicken and rabbit becoming the main proteins, and of course the later invention of the seafood Paella.

So it's kind of an interesting microcosm. Pinning an exact date is something that'll feel arbitrary - more accurately, it's more of a... process. What we see with Paella is some loose threads going back to the Middle Ages, innovation picking up in the 1700s, then an explosion in Paella in the 1800s. It's a pattern that you can see repeated with a lot of dishes.",mthmchris,2020-02-08 22:06:07

I don't really have too much of a response per se, as ""a decline in the gross amount of time society devotes to cooking"" was just sort of one idea I was knocking around in my head.

One of the things that's really quite interesting though is looking back at this kind of labor data - I'd be really interested to learn more about working class women in the labor force. Another interesting aspect looking back is that in many ways pre-industrial farmers/peasants actually had less working hours than we do today! Their days were longer, but they have *way* more holidays. It's something I tend to notice travelling around China/Asia too - a lot of the people in villages seem to have a surprising amount of... free time. When the standard narrative, of course, is that industrialization makes us work less - we do work less than our 19th century counterparts, but mostly because we have specific laws that require it. Capitalism's default status, for good or ill, is a total subsumption of all your time to the act of production. 

>The conventional narrative is that feminism and the microwave conspired to kill home cooking sometime in 1960, but I'd say that home cooking and traditional foodways in general were slowly strangled by industrialization and urbanization themselves, and those processes go back centuries.

Basically, I want to agree, but what I can't seem to square is this: industrialization and innovation in food actually seemed to go *hand in hand* until the post war period. And it makes intuitive sense - higher living standards, more ingredients, more possibilities. But then why the sudden drop off?

There's actually an interesting phenomenon in China, actually. Post war, there was a similar dearth of food innovation, because, like *of course* there was... given what the society was going through. Then post '78? You can see a brief window in the 80s to mid 90s of new dishes being invented (e.g. suancai fish), then... it stops.

It feels like it's less industrialization that's to blame, but something else inherent in modernism... but I just can't put my finger on what. Though it's also an interesting coincidence that the slowing of food innovation in China was followed by, a bit later, mainland Chinese cinema kind of going to shit.",mthmchris,2020-02-08 23:29:10

Over the last couple of years in London, I've seen a massive amount of innovation and experimentation around vegan food. It's another example of limitations leading to creativity. A couple of years ago, vegan food was rarely available. Now we've got innovation around fake meats with some of them actually good and a vegan sausage roll becoming a massive nationwide hit. We've got new ways of cooking current favourites with previously obscure (at least here) ingredients from aquafaba to jackfruit going mainstream.

It started out based off of some people on forums imitating Tapatio, then went sideways.

Chilis are a mix of ones selected for heat and color. For the restaurant we used a mix of Sichuan Erjingtiao, Guizhou Bullet Chilis, and Guizhou xiaomila. For this one I used Erjingtiao, Guizhou chicken claw, and Sichuan Heaven Facing. 

Toasted, then given a cold water soak. At the same time, the Sichuan peppercorns are also given a cold water soak. The cold water soak extracts the floral quality of the peppercorns without the numbingness (so I would never like advertise that there's Sichuan peppercorns in there, it's nice but subtle). For the restaurant we deseeded the chilis and soaked the seeds in mijiu rice wine (a stronger Cantonese rice wine, ~30%) so that we could add X amount of seed wine to the final sauce and get a standard sort of heat-level, but at home I usually go with my standard ""cut open the chilis, let a good bit of the seeds fall out, keep in the remaining"".

After the soak, a touch of garlic and cumin are toasted. Then everything's blended together... the chilis, peppercorn water, spices, a bit of Chinese chili powder, the rice vinegar, the laozao fermented rice, the mijiu rice wine, a touch of sugar and MSG. For the restaurant I also added some Hainan lantern chili sauce (cheating a little, I know... but Hainan lantern is the only habanero-like Chinese chili there is, I liked the fruitiness, and it's only readily available in Shenzhen in sauce form). That sauce also contains a solid chunk of minced garlic and a bit of pumpkin for body/color. Unfortunately I didn't have that on hand for this, but it turned out that it wasn't imperative or anything.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I can make a blended hot sauce without Laozao fermented rice any more haha. It really adds that missing X factor that not-fermented hot sauces tend to have.

And oh, the restaurant's name is Teqo. Haven't been back there for a couple months, hope the cooks there are still doing a good job with the sauce :)",mthmchris,2020-02-08 22:52:07

I've read up history of the restaurant in France before... it's all super fascinating. Definitely didn't connect the dots though that chefs at the time were, at their core, finding creative uses for stocks - that's a really interesting thought. 

Because if you think about it, *so* much of Western - and especially French - cuisine is grounded in stocks. Sometimes I joke around that the first thing you learn in culinary school in China is knife skills, while in the West it's stocks and broths (not *totally* true in the strictest sense of the word 'true', but... close enough). Like, just how knife skills are important the world over... stocks/broths are *certainly* foundational in Chinese cooking as well, but nothing like it is in French cooking. I wonder to what extent that was true of French food, pre-restaurant?

As an aside, one of my favorite YouTube channels is *French Cooking Academy*. Feels kind of akin to what we try to accomplish on our channel (lots of random asides on the history/culture of the food), but... their channel is *way* better produced lol. Me and Steph binge it quite a bit, and watching it there's this... ineffable *similarity* between French and Chinese cooking.

It's really really hard to pin down what exactly, because obviously the end results are *vastly* different, right? The style of eating is different, the flavors are *radically* different... in some ways, the cuisines are polar opposites of eachother. But if you watch someone cooking proper French food... you could kind of imagine even the snobbiest Chinese chef sitting alongside you, nodding in approval ""mm. Ok. Makes sense"". And visa versa. 

Let me give you an example. The other day I was watching French Cooking Academy's Pot au Feu video, and in it he used an old technique where he brought the soup to a boil, skimmed, shut off the heat, and repeated. Reason being, you get the most impurities right when coming to a boil. Totally makes sense in a Chinese context! Chinese recipes also emphasize that you should do a good job skimming right as it's coming to a boil. They don't do it three times, but Chinese recipes *love* calling to repeat XYZ process three times haha (e.g. the number of times you add cool water to the pot when boiling dumplings, the number of times you dip chicken into boiling water before dropping it in when making Bak Chit Gai). I could totally imagine a Chinese chef nodding and thinking ""ok, yeah, I'm with you"". Or going the other way... in high end Shandong cuisine they make what's basically a consomm√© by putting mincemeat in a tofu cloth and simmering it to absorb the impurities. 

There's also a similar love/appreciation of novel ingredients. While American seem to be generally hesitant to munch down on Bugs Bunny, in France people *happily* enjoy rabbit... while in Sichuan they'll even crack open the heads and enjoy it as a snack.

I wonder if there was a similar structure to how the cuisines evolved that caused that. I've heard that in France the high end dishes drew from what the peasants were eating. In a similar fashion, I feel like in China there was a similar historical pattern of peasant food --> banquet culture (food for the emperor/aristocrats) --> food for the bourgeoisie (~1870s to ~1930s) --> food for the middle/upper middle class. One interesting note is that a **lot** of famous Chinese dishes were actually invented by... government officials (e.g. Kung Pao chicken). While they had servants to do most of the cooking, up to the very end of the Qing dynasty cooking was sort of this collective hobby of the aristocracy.

It kind of goes against a lot of things that I stand for/think are good (eating traditional foods from around the world, post-modernism in general, etc), so I'm not sure where exactly I stand on it.

In both modern America *and* modern China, if you're ever feeling sick of eating the same things... you can just go an find another cuisine. In America, a global cuisine. In China, another Chinese cuisine. Chefs/restaurants/cooks don't *need* to be as inventive because *the world has so many awesome things as is*. In fact, maybe it's better that they **don't** innovate - maybe as cooks and consumers, the optimal situation involves hewing as closely to what's already been invented as possible. Each cuisine can play the same record, the same hits... but that's ok I guess, because a modern capitalist society can gives us a culinary-Spotify-playlist where we can find new old stuff into perpetuity.  

But I can't help but feel that there's something lost in translation. Here's an interesting phenomenon: Chinese food in America **and** Western food in China both contain *tons* of sugar, way more than you'd find in each respective cuisine back home. Why? I don't really have an answer, but it feels like what ends up being popular in each new place is the equivalent of the Kid's Menu. Think about the popular Western food in China: pizza, burgers, ice cream, fries... that *is* a Denny's Kid's menu. Meanwhile, a lot of the popular dishes in American Chinese takeout - Sweet and Sour Pork, Lemon Chicken, etc - *are* real Chinese dishes, but are those that're classic to feed the kids at the table. Huh.

Then there's the problem of *centerlessness*. Suppose you were a chef and invented a new, super tasty dish. In the past, this would spread around your local community, the people around you would copy it and adapt it... the dish would end up being served in local events, functions, festivals... it would become *part of the cuisine*.

How does this work in a *Bowling Alone* kind of society? **Is** there such thing as local cuisine anymore? Maybe local cuisines stopped developing because they... simply don't exist. 

>I've made char shui a couple of times...but with bacon because it was in my price range (if you get a chance to try it, I recommend it. Thick cut bacon turns into this fatty, semi-jerky in the oven). I have foodie friends - the kind that DO think themselves good cooks - and they scoff at my adaptations. A great example is the visceral, knee-jerk reaction i get from everyone when I tell them I don't put red kidney beans in chili and use other beans instead, usually chick peas/garbanzo beans. It's like sending a declaration of war! And that is a substitution I have to make because my kid can't eat kidney beans!

Tell those people to shove it.

For us, **we** consider authenticity important so that what we teach people actually has a base in something. The time-tested technique is usually a lot more interesting and cool than any hack we could create. But while I think it's a super important thing for people *teaching* to stick to, I **don't** think it's important for people *learning*. Let me explain.

We dive deep into the techniques and ingredients so that people understand the logic of what's going on in the dish. When you understand the logic, the framework... then you can make *informed* adaptations. 

For example, let's take a look at hand-pulled noodles. There's tons of recipes for them in English, and... they're all wrong. At hand-pulled noodle schools in China you should be able to make a hand-pulled noodle from start-to-finish in under 18 minutes. That's very difficult, but a normal person should be able to do it all in under and hour. All of the English recipes are missing a critical ingredient which's the thing that *makes* hand-pulled noodles, well, hand-pullable: a type of soda ash called *penghui*.

Now, there's certain workarounds that we've found that hew to the *logic* of using penghui without actually specifically using it. I'm gunna be crypic here because I *do* kind of want us to be to be the first proper English-language hand-pulled noodle recipe ;) But many of these other recipes use cake flour, which... would make for shitty noodles. You'd be able to physically pull the noodles (so you'll be able to make a visually impressive YouTube video), but you'll get soft, mushy noodles in the end. The opposite of what you want! You might as well make Japanese Ramen, or Italian Pasta, or whatever.

So it's not that you need to *only* make authentic hand-pulled noodles, but that we can all learn a lot more by understanding the true logic behind the dish, so that we can (1) make informed substitutions and (2) borrow techniques, even when we can't borrow ingredients.

>
-carrot cake - there are lots of variations on it, I am sure you can pick one that you like. Maybe do 50/50 rice & wheat flours then steam it for a sticky bun effect then go ham with more condensed milk? You could also add a bunch of spices, so it's more of a spice cake with carrot.

We've been there... four times in all? It can kind of scratch that same itch of going to Southeast Asia, only with the **massive** benefit that we actually know the language (which always makes for way better travelling).

One of the real challenges in approaching Yunnan food is figuring out how to approach a lot of the... novel ingredients that're used. Luckily we've found that a good chunk of the herbs and such that're used can also be found in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, but it can still be a variable. We do need to go back and do more research too. 

One of our favorite things we ate in Yunnan was an Achang dish called ""ËøáÊâãÁ±≥Á∫ø"" - not a typo, it's a totally different thing than ËøáÊ°•Á±≥Á∫ø. Really hard to describe, just give it a Google if you're interested. It available in Mangshi (awesome little city btw), and comes from a tiny town called Husa.

We definitely need to go back to Yunnan - Steph always talks about how she really wants to go again - but the next trip we're planning is (1) a quick stop in Fuzhou (got a couple dishes we need to research/take B Roll for) followed by (2) a dive through Shandong and Henan. So I think the soonest we'll be out that way is next year :)

There's tons of convenience stores everywhere, and they pretty much all sell beer and Chinese liquor (7-11s also sell a bit of overpriced imported liquor/wine). I remember the very first time when I studied abroad in China (was 19, doing a summer at Tsinghua in Beijing) I saw that the dorm vending machines carried beer (for cheap!)... for 19 year old mthmchris that was like mindblowing haha.

*Almost* makes up for the fact that weed's become like non-existent here the past ~three years. Had to quit the latter myself, the government keeps on going around and randomly piss testing people at bars.",mthmchris,2020-02-09 11:13:11

We also get the very fatty pork belly here too. I think it's a matter of breeds. The American-style pig has gain a *lot* of popularity in the past couple decades due to its high yield  - incidentally, that was also the breed that had that huge issue with swine flu over this past year. I'm not sure if the less fatty ""layered"" pork belly is from a different breed or not... but yeah here in Guangdong we need to either get that sort from either (1) restaurant suppliers or (2) Carrefour (I'm usually an open air market supremacist haha, but I'll admit that the pork at Carrefours here are very good)

There's an interesting history there, though! I just woke up an am I bit lazy, so I'm just going to copy/paste from the Wikipedia article you just linked ;)

>The origin is somewhat uncertain.[3][6][7] While the Chinese word ""mantou"" has been suggested as the origin for the word ""manti"", different Chinese characters have been used for the word in the past indicating that the Chinese attempted to adapt a foreign word to their writing system.[2] **Originally, mantou was meat-filled. Mantou still retains its old meaning of stuffed bun in Wu Chinese as moedeu. But in Mandarin and many other varieties of Chinese, mantou refers to plain steamed buns, while baozi resembles the ancient mantou stuffed with meat.[7][8][9][10]**

>The dish may have originated in the territories of the Mongol Empire.[6][11] Some variations may be traced back to the Uyghur people of northwest China.[3][6] One of the earliest mentions of manta is found in the 1330 manuscript Yinshan Zhengyao by Hu Sihui, a court therapist in service of the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, Buyantu Khan.[6][12]",mthmchris,2020-02-11 22:04:07

The majority of ingredients are only theoretically available. Even well-stocked Asian/Chinese stores in Germany don't carry Chinese leaf greens (no enough demand to ship them over), rousong/meat wool (not allowed to be imported commercially) or proper Sichuan pepper (almost all of them are not ma). And those things are rather well-known. And even if you can get them, it's a big hassle to order them (expensively) over he Internet.

There's also the problem of lost knowledge, and lost vegetable/fruit varieties. The irony is, more variety (imported fruits and vegetables) will hurt the more rarely used local ingredients.

Another point, regarding the time spent: to make elderflower cordial (a classic refreshing drink in Germany, for example), you have to go out during a certain time of the year and search for the blossoms. Same with woodruff bowl (another classic drink): you can get that for a few weeks a year, max, and you got to know where to find it and how it looks. You can't buy it in stores.

In America we are catching on to that style of eating.

I am in the US and a lot of the ingredients and dishes you talk about just go right over my head. But the historical musings were fun. I once took a class in Medieval cooking and learned that, despite what one might think, the European courts ate quite well ‚Äî spices were a sign of wealth and so the more flavorful the better. It‚Äôs also the time when the first cookbooks were written so we actually do have a small record of the dishes. That was the first time I had almond milk. We made it for a dish with peas. 
Anyway I think you‚Äôre right that 1750 forward is a time of great innovation in cooking. It is a time of innovation in everything. I‚Äôm not nearly as pessimistic as you in terms of new foods, though. It takes a while for a new dish to become a classic staple and only a small percentage survive.

Authenticity to the ingredients and the history of the dish. Just yolo-ing together something without the history is a building without a foundation. You did a great episode on Mapo Tofu where you compared the CIA's version to your local version and that really highlights the need to be educated on the fundamentals of regional cooking, Chinese or otherwise. I 100% support people like you ensuring that the current and future generations know The Old Ways. 

Going back to the question of why there are no new foods, I think Globalism is a 2 edged sword there as you hinted at. I live in a major city. I can eat food from dozens of countries within walking distance even. Access to international cuisine with varying levels of authenticity is a great luxury, but like you said it alleviates the need to come up with new ideas to an extent. 

At the same time, exploration & expansion require leaving authenticity behind to a degree. You can see traces of this throughout history such as where Asian spices and Indian foods mixed with local ingredients in the Caribbean.  Pretty much any previously occupied region shows this, too. The next step is to push the bubble and fling oneself into the unknown and hope for the best. The difference is now we're doing it deliberately, like art becoming self aware it feels somewhat less authentic to choose to fuse food cultures together. I don't think it is, but it evokes feelings of betraying the past and losing the authenticity that brought us here. 

Not sure I have a full point here, but that's my take on it anyway. And I appreciate having someone to ramble onto about the culture of food semantics with.


PS - I can't find the source now, but I think someone has done an english recipe for hand pulled because I have read about penghui & noodles before. Don't let that stop you.

I did read the whole thing, and it was a pleasure to read. I do think taking out some of the ellipses and extra ""thats"" and being deliberate about hyphens versus full stops to take out some of the breathless quality would very much have the same voice to me, but read more smoothly.

Swatches of EVEN MORE Asian Cushion Foundations~ Skin Tone MAC 25-30 / Korean Shade 23-25 [Part 3],66,2023-07-26 19:21:10,https://i.redd.it/buqpm94r0deb1.jpg,AsianBeauty,"hello\~ i'm back with another review / swatch for people with light-medium skin! as shared previously in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/152dprk/swatches_of_many_different_korean_cushion/) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/155x48l/swatches_of_more_korean_cushion_foundations_skin/), when i was at my tannest (medium) i struggled a lot to find a cushion foundation that would work for me, so i wanna share my experiences with yall so you don't have to go through the same struggles.

for this review, i will give a rating, a tl;dr, and also in-depth review for all.

priorities: i have dry skin, and my biggest concern is making sure dry patches and creases don't happen. i also prefer a semi-matte glowy finish as a result. i live in a dry climate when i'm not in korea. **i used rom&nd's nu zero of shade 05 sand as a control between parts 1, 2 and 3. this cushion is pretty close to my exact skin shade.**

# reviews

* **espoir pro tailor be glow cushion: 7/10 -** ***""not the best i've tried, but not bad""***
   * **has a semi-matte finish**: finds a great balance between being too matte or too dewy. doesn't give the dewy effect i get from the missha glow cushion ([refer to part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/155x48l/swatches_of_more_korean_cushion_foundations_skin/) for review).
   * **tone-up effect:** despite i got same shade for the **be glow** and **be velvet** cushions, this one was slightly brighter. the tone-up effect isn't too much though.
   * **doesn't hide your pores as much:** compared to other cushions like the rom&nd bloom coverfit ([refer to part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/155x48l/swatches_of_more_korean_cushion_foundations_skin/) for review) or rom&nd nu zero (from [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/152dprk/swatches_of_many_different_korean_cushion/)), it doesn't seem to cover pores as well. this is generally not a huge issue for me as i don't have large visible pores, but my friend who also tried this was not a fan.
   * **not too many dry patches:** this didn't have too many dry patches with proper skin prep. make sure to exfoliate with toner pads beforehand, or else it will definitely be an issue if you have dry skin like me.
* **espoir be velvet cushion: 4/10 -** ***""nooo... just no. but it might work for other skin types?""***
   * **matte finish**: this cushion has a matte finish that can give you a clean look.
   * **dry patches galore:** this clung to my dry spots, even with the same detailed prep i did with the other tests. it was impossible to clean even with serum, and just felt tighter n tighter on my skin.
   * **uneven application:** bc of its thick consistency, this is really hard to get even application off of. i didn't have the same issue with the **be glow**, so i wonder why.
   * **smelled like hand sanitizer?!** this stuff smelled like those hand sanitizers you can get at a drug store. i wonder if there was alcohol, because it felt tight and drying on my skin. i usually don't note fragrance, but this was really strong.
   * **orangey:** this doesn't show in the photo well, but it was so orangey IRL. the shade is unrealistically peachy -  a bit of orangeness can help even out dullness in medium skin tones, but this just emphasized the dry patches that it caused.
   * **this might work for oily or combo skin**, or people wanting **higher coverage**: but it just wasn't it for me.
* **unleashia satin wear green cushion - 6/10 -** ***""awful but innovative packaging ruined it""***
   * **innovative cushion container:** this cushion container uses a button on the side for you to push out the product through holes, which then goes onto the puff. it was creative in its design which i can appreciate....**however, bc the holes were all placed in the center of the puff, it caused...**
   * **uneven application:** i couldn't for the life of me figure out how to evenly apply onto the puff. it was very uneven on the face no matter how i blended.
   * **semi-matte / dewy finish:** this has a nice semi-matte finish which gets a bit dewy throughout the day
   * **good coverage:** despite its heavier coverage, it was able to blur out pores and didn't look unnatural
   * **no dry patches:** it didn't have any dry patches despite its heavier, uneven coverage.
   * **shades:** this brand doesn't offer a shade 25, but their 23 seemed a bit too light for me. whilst the 27 is too dark for me, i would recommend this shade to anyone who uses the medium-deep JSM essential nuder (from [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/152dprk/swatches_of_many_different_korean_cushion/)).
* **blessed moon girly serum cushion - 8.5/10 -** ***""a dry skin girly's new holy grail""***
   * **innovative but GOOD packaging:** on the topic of new unique packaging, this also has a different packaging! open the compact normally, take out the puff, then you have to rotate the inner compact to reveal the cushion. it took me a few tries to figure it out, but i actually like it - it prevents leaking and makes swapping out the refill a lot easier.
   * **dewy finish**: this gives you a healthy, dewy finish.
   * **packed with skincare ingredients:** this stuff is packed with skincare ingredients which i appreciate a lot.
   * **only 3 shades:** this only comes in 3 shades, 19.5, 22.2 and 25.9. i'm not sure how they determined these decimals, but the 25.9 was def a bit darker than a ""standard"" 25 shade (somewhere between the rom&nd 25 and unleashia's 27, so 26ish).
   * **coverage is just right:** this has just enough coverage to cover light blemishes, yet giving you a healthy glow.
   * **slight creasing:** i love this stuff, but be careful around the lip or nose area - just make sure not to put too much product there, bc it has heavier coverage than the JSM, or it can easily crease.",PasteIIe,2023-07-26 20:14:51

* **laneige neo glow - 9/10 -** ***""almost perfect.""***
   * **your skin but better:** it has a nice, glowy finish which i love.
   * **no dry patches**
   * **i hate the puff. I HATE ITTTT!!** the puff has a slightly weird shape to it, kinda convex? it makes it harder to get to the creases of your face like edges of your nose
   * **a bit lighter than the average 25, but not orangey at all:** this cushion is lighter than the rom&nd, clio, and espoir's 25 by just a tad, but not at shade 23. if 25 is a tone-up shade for you, the laneige 25 will not work for you. they have a shade 31, 33 and 35 that's sold in Indonesian retailers.  https://imgur.com/kXoW6N1 
* **em cosmetics daydream cushion - 8/10 -** ***""michelle phan did a fantastic job, bringing diverse shades to AB.""***
   * **shade range:** michelle did a great job by providing 6 different **actual shades that are based on actual skin colors that exist**. this is #3 of the 6 shades, and this one would fit those with a yellow-ish, olive skin tone (commonly seen in asian heritage). this cushion also comes with darker shades for gorgeous tanned olive skin, or beautiful black skin tones.
   * **great puff:** this comes with a triangular shaped puff, alllowing you to get into the nooks and crannies of your nose and face.
   * **a few dry patches:** this did cling to some of my dry patches, but it wasn't hugely visible and nothing a cotton swab can't clean up
   * **medium, buildable coverage**: perfect balance for those that want a natural or glam look.

# final thoughts

**hope this helps!** i think this will probably be one of the last installments for a while, as i haven't found many cushions that seem interesting to test. if you'd like specific swatches side by side or have sth you'd like me to try, let me know! thank you for reading\~",PasteIIe,2023-07-26 20:14:59

disclaimer: the 03 honey is dew jelly cushion, and 04 tan is dew power cushion, so they're technically from different lines, but the swatch colors look similar even in their product photos, so i would assume that this is just the shades that they provide across all their lines. the biggest problem isn't that 04 tan is darker (which it is, especially irl) but that it's just way too warm (not neutral like the rom&nd line).

You shouldn't be comparing an arcade racer like Horizon to a racing sim like Motorsport. You shouldn't expect a racing game to be anything more than a racing game. You can't criticize the tracks when they are modeled after real life racing tracks. 

Forza Motorsport shouldn't be marked down for not appealing to everyone, it's supposed to be there for the gamer who like the cars, and the more realistic racing experience, as opposed to the frankly ridiculous open-world take on racing that is Forza Horizon. It would be like criticizing a new Call of Duty for not going out of it's way to appeal to people who don't like first person shooters.

Honestly I'm kinda sick of this idea that every game should be for them. People feel so self important that they can't stand the idea of there being a game that just isn't made with them in mind so they lash out and have a tantrum.",Funky_Pigeon911,2023-10-04 10:16:21

Even though they updated the car levels, you still have to spend hours upgrading your car, because the credits doesn't follow the levels xp at all. Max car level should be 30. 

Theres still breaking issues and a lot of different iconic drift cars can't get drift tires at all. Plus, where's the drift mode? Also the different engine sounds seems to be very weak.

I can be going 200 km/h and it still feels like Im going 40.
It just feels boring and like the game is more focused on single player career mode, than fun with your friends or with other online. 

No HP shown, only KW.

Theres no AI's in a private multiplayer game. Also, if it's supposed to be realistic and standard cars to begin with, then where's the horn? Kinda weird not to include it, as it also makes it more fun in multiplayer games as well and so many buttons are unassigned anyway. Cars can only take visual damage and you cant even lose a side mirror. 

Way to many cars, can't get upgraded. 

And again, no split screen, which just takes a lot of the fun away. The classic split screen drifting for points were the best! 

In Forza Motorsport 7, one of my best drifters was a 2000 Nissan Silvia-Spec R, so I tried to replicate it..
Aftes 8-10 hours I could finally afford all the parts and tuned it the same way.. But turned out to be a load of bull. It couldn't drift at all!

Seems to me, that they changed to much, trying to make a better game. And if they made a remastered version of Forza Motorsport 3 or 4, without changing the psysics, I would gladly pay $80 or more!

Im soooo glad, I didn't pay for this!! Worst forza ever.

Why not?

If you review a game like Motorsport, but you find Horizon more interesting why can you not bring that up? This is a review not some objective measuring of the game's merits. 

Also its such a cop out to say that you shouldn't expect more from racing games. Forza has taken out multiple aspects of their past Motorsport games in this game, so its even less of a racing game than previous. And why can't people want more than just the simple racing in these games? These games has genuinely not evolved since the original Xbox and PS2 days with PGR and GT.

But CoD goes out of its way, their single-player campaigns are basically ""Hollywood action blockbuster: the game"", even my mother can play and enjoy them. Compare them to unfriendly and ""boring"" military sims like Arma and tell me what would you recommend more to the general audience. 

> Forza Motorsport shouldn't be marked down for not appealing to everyone

It depends on what people expect the reviews and scores to reflect. Sometimes 10/10 means ""the game is for everyone"", 6/10 - ""not for everyone"", and maybe there is nothing wrong with that?",SnevetS_rm,2023-10-04 12:39:25

Forza Motorsport - Review Thread,455,2023-10-04 08:04:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16zhawz/forza_motorsport_review_thread/,Games,"Because racing games in general over the last ten years have been in a puddle of blah compared to where they used to be, in large part *because* of a lack of identity and an obsession with the Horizon series‚Äô ‚Äúfreedom to do whatever‚Äù concept. Back in the day, we had serious racers like GT/Forza, well-received arcade racers like NFS, chaotic racers like Burnout, and the occasional unique treat like Test Drive Unlimited, all with a different tone, sense of progression (some of us enjoy the connection built up over time, to one or two cars at a time), elements like crashes/police chases, sports cars vs. daily drivers, etcetera.

For the last ten years, it‚Äôs mostly been Forza Horizon getting the love and attention from reviewers and the public, or the ‚Äúsim racers‚Äù like GT. Sure there‚Äôs stuff like iRacing/AC for the hardcore kids, Dirt Rally, and other titles here and there, but most people seem to point to Horizon.

While Horizon is a beautiful game and can be a lot of fun for a casual player, they are also simultaneously incredibly bland. Almost no story at all, every character/line of dialogue feels straight out of an advertisement. It‚Äôs a game with no real sense of progression, hardly at all (outside of FOMO weekly cars‚Äîwoohoo). Hundreds of cars dumped on you weekly.

Sure it‚Äôs fun to just launch the game and drive over some hills in my RS500. But it has lost all character that older racing games had, and hardly feels like an experience worth the love considering it‚Äôs only changed slightly here and there since 3.

A lot of us don‚Äôt want every game in a genre to be the same, and when we see mechanics of newer titles streamline themselves more and more over the years, it can be disheartening. I do get where you‚Äôre coming from‚Äîif people here were always comparing every shooter to COD, every RPG to Starfield, etcetera. But that‚Äôs *what these reviews are doing,* comparing a game like this to an open-world racer with an entirely different goal/playerbase. Ah well‚Äîat least it‚Äôs in the same franchise.",Thrasher9294,2023-10-04 13:24:14

Forza has never been the pinnacle of racing sim games. It is just a marginally less arcade racing game then Horizon. 

The review does talk about some of these things although its kind of vague.

>Stuff like the car leveling system, which has now been tortuously tied to the upgrade system, lacks the warranty that it did in previous titles, becoming an awkward obstacle you work around. It leads to a mechanic of growth that hasn‚Äôt been fully realized here, forcing you to play with what is tantamount to Hot Wheels without the ramps.

I don't think reviews need to be tailored to racing sim enjoyers. Someone that doesn't enjoy racing sim games but enjoys racing games can get something out of this review. I enjoy both but lean towards someone in the middle which is more than Motorsport is anyways. To me this game seems like its a good title for Gamepass because I can try it and see if it truly is tremendously boring with little to do like many reviews have stated.",Late_Cow_1008,2023-10-04 17:09:40

While technically impressive, FH5 is imo the absolute weakest entry in the entire series. They degraded so many great features, the ‚Äùdo-anything-you-want-immediately‚Äù design is painfully apparent still, the map is easily the most boring one out of any Forza Horizon game. (seriously, how the fuck did they manage to make MEXICO look boring lmao)

The ‚Äùcampaign‚Äù is somehow even worse now and the music selection is pretty awful as well (except Odesza‚Äôs tracks, they slap) and the car selection, while plentiful, leaves a lot to be desired, yet FH5 scored highest out of any FH title? How the fuck did IGN manage a 10/10 for that game? I liked my time with it, but I couldn‚Äôt imagine scoring the game that high, even if the cars look so realistic I mistake them for real-life models sometimes.

TL;DR 

Gaming outlets like IGN or Gamespot or PCgamer just do not know how to review racing games, because they haven‚Äôt invested the time into all the different games the genre has to offer, which leaves them to review these games with barely even scratching the surface. I can‚Äôt really blame them, because the intro and the first 2 hours of FH5 do leave a very good impression, it‚Äôs just that when you venture into the 10-15 hour mark, you‚Äôve pretty much already seen everything FH5 has to offer, which usually is enough for these people, so they base their review off of that.",FinnishScrub,2023-10-04 13:00:47

That would require a degree of journalistic integrity, which, unfortunately, is directly at odds with the click-based advertisement revenue model. But they should have done that. 

I know that in our current era of infinite tolerance and ""accessibility"" that this is a controversial take but: 

Every game is not for every gamer. Nor should that be a design goal. 

And a simulation racing game shouldn't be reviewed by ""not a car guy."" 

Not that I'm too surprised. We saw some similar reviews last month with Armored Core 6 from casuals complaining that it should have been more like Elden Ring. It was just a massive influx of ""reviewers"" with zero knowledge of the series or why it is so beloved by the fanbase who were now reviewing it simply because FromSoft got popular and it would generate clicks.

This really goes for any genre that is in any way niche or takes some time to get good at.

Like for some 3rd person action shenanigans like Assassin's Creed or GTA or whatever they're kind of fine because those are so ""generic"" these days that the reviewers have also had plenty of experience with those kinds of games in the past. FPS games in most cases also fit in that category.

But when you start to go into genres like any kinds of simulators or strategy games or fighting games you really do need to have more than a surface level understanding of the genre and what it has to offer before you can even tell what it does right and what it does wrong. This is why I rarely even look at these kinds of reviews for really any game and if I do, I take them with a huge grain of salt.",Spork_the_dork,2023-10-04 13:55:02

Reviews ""can"" appeal to the mainstream, but I don't think that's the only context reviewers should be aiming for. And I think it's less useful to the take that approach the more niche of a category any given game falls into.

Otherwise you basically run into the situation where game scores and reviews are just a measure of how much mainstream appeal a game has. That's not necessarily a problem for the occasional review, but when the vast majority of reviews use that context, reviews become too narrow-minded.",Goronmon,2023-10-04 18:31:26

Then use the events carefully and plan them to make the most money back per upgrade and car purchase to get through the hundreds of events in the most efficient manner. 

You can grind races over and over but the games really come into their own when you try to maximise the credit return from each purchase you make without repeating events with the ultimate goal of completing the game. In comparison Forza games tend to throw cars and money at you like it's going out of style and upgrading is basically never necessary, it feels way more spoonfed.

This has to be one of the best descriptions I have ever heard of Turkey. In the 80s, Turkey was very cosmopolitan.  Americans were looked upon with favor, as long as you behaved and showed respect for their country and culture. 

I did date, but it was understood clearly that I was not getting married any time soon, if ever. 

A month before l left the country, the family of a girl that I was friends with asked me to come to their country place for a long weekend. Her father, brothers, cousins, and all of the males down to age 11 worked on me in the hopes that I would choose to return and marry the girl.  Her name was Isune.  They really rolled out the red carpet. I was confused by this and feared that they thought I had disrespected her ( had sex).  That could get you killed back then.   It turns out that Isune had really fallen in love with me and had asked her father to intervene. 

We remain friends to this day. She has 6 kids, and a really great husband who treats her like a queen.

It is a secular country by all means and the big cities are more akin to South Eastern Europe in vibe if anything. Lots of girls date before marrying, far from everyone is Muslim.

Completely false and flies in the face of men's experiences. 

Turkey is actually islamic-centric despite the seemingly secular society. To put it in perspective, Turkey is between Tunisia and Greece in secularism, leaning more towards Tunisia's religiosity. 

Honestly, I dont know how you were able to marry a turkish girl since theyre extremely clannish people who stick to their own culture and resist approaches from Europeans. But since youre SE asian it makes sense especially if you hail from Indonesia which is mostly muslim like Turkey. If youre not Indonesian, then it still makes sense since turkey is still far friendlier towards anything other than Europeans.

It is interesting how many Asian guys are highly desired in other parts of the world while in America, they are the least popular group for dating. And the moral of the story is: America doesn't equal the world so there are plenty of places where the marriage market is better than in the US. Go where you are celebrated.

So my question is, 1) how fast do the girls get married there? Because you mentioned 1.5 years of dating. is it common to get married quickly after meeting? 2) What was your mehr (gift) to your wife upon marriage and how expensive are the weddings there?",Historyfan1453,2024-04-19 23:25:52

(ironically, you being a servant of U.S. imperialism/South Korea looks better to Turkish people, being they are  from and devotees to a U.S. ally and NATO member state, than my Iranian background; I won't even be surprised when many Turkish people dislike my Iranian citizenship and the fact that I'll likely have to serve 2 years in the military there; they'll be confused and even at worst insist on typifying me as an ""American"" regardless.)

And your observations are spot-on. I would like to correct a few points, as there are things that you are unable to observe from your position:  
  
1. Turkiye indeed not crazy Islamist country, it's just western propaganda. However it does not have the secular lifestyle¬†you observed either - you lived only in big cities, and met with secular people. But in smaller cities, villages, or even regions you would find many conservative families. Konya and Trabzon are notoriously famous when it comes to that. But both sides usually live in their ""bubble"" and almost never interact with each other, to the point that they don't know the other side exists.  
5. This is also a spot-on observation: In Turkiye they don't know what racism is - however this doesn't mean we don't find some another stuff to hate each other. Such as different Islamic sects, or different type of nationalism. Again, you haven't experience any of them because you are in the bubble.

And about your observations regarding Turkish women:

As others pointed out, you have US passport. Turks are already quite sympathetic towards Korea, and now K-Pop is a big thing. Plus, you have a good job, and as you stated you are tall and well build. So no surprise your wife cares about you, and acts decent, and does not asks for gifts. Turkish people (despite the patriotism) have immense inferiority complex towards west, despite they are just as talented, beautiful and even more secular. It's like a jackpot for western men.  
  
And I like to add another plus not mentioned yet: As a Korean you probably know how important it is to respect each other's culture by nature, and you simply followed whatever your wife says to keep her happy.  
In fact, I found some of your comments pretty naive: Turkish girls don't ""date with marriage always in mind."" They put that face for the marriage material guys, like you. Of course, it's better than western women not interested in getting married, but one must be careful.

And without the conditions above, Turkish women are crazy whiny witches turns your life a nightmare, puppet of their mothers, just as all other women. Plus, now you have to deal with her father, brother and all the relatives you mentioned, people with such mentality you normally wouldn't even consider being in contact with.

Possibly for turkish men but not for turkish women. I can understand their affinity with indonesians because of muslim culture which possibly explains why OP had success with the turkish woman. 

.
> Most Turks don‚Äôt like migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Africa, etc. In fact, racism is rising because of Erdogan‚Äôs uncontrolled border policy.

Most will have to disagree with your statement, Theyre more amiable towards their muslim counterparts from other muslim countries because of their muslim background. Turks are actually more racist towards Europeans than anyone else. 

.
> Turks have a very strong bond with each other, and they fear this will erode over time if too many foreigners from unpopular countries arrive.

This is the only thing I agree with given their strong national/racial/religious/cultural traits.  They dont like outsiders (mostly European) taking away their women. I actually saw many times in a few clubs in Turkey the men surround and siphoning off the turkish women from advances of Europeans. This happened EVERY TIME and EVERYWHERE.

They really don't see skin color as an issue. That is a general statement. A particular family may have strong feelings against you, but that has more to do with how pop culture black Americans are portrayed. 

Like any other man, color aside; you will be judged more on your personal success and your character than your color. 

If you are talking about dating and / or marriage, the family and how they see you matter a whole lot more than your color. 

My experiences while I was there in the 1980s were really great. I was in the Air Force, and there were a lot of black American men who loved Turkey that I served with. I know of three who went back to Turkey after they got out. Two got married and are still there with big, happy families. 

For them, they saw a place where they could succeed. They saw possibilities that they didn't see in America. They just found a better home. My family hosted one of the boys when he went to college in California, where we lived at the time.  Great kid. He got his engineering degree, went home, and is now married with two kids. Living his best life.

Wow,this got recommended to me and grabbed my attention. 
With regards to the religion playing a role part, I'd like to share my experience with a Turkish family, but im not Turkish,I'm lebanese.
My wife is Turkish/Circassian, and when I met her ( we were both very young), religion did NOT play much of a role in their lives at all...like, nearly non-existent except culturally. 
But fast forward now, 25 years later,their tone has changed somewhat, and they are trying to become religious (except my wife, of course )but don't know the basics.

If youre a troll it will only make you look bad. 

Anyway, religion DOES play a huge part in Turkish culture, especially nationality. Turks are very proud of their country. So what are you talking about??

.
> most Turks don‚Äôt know much about Indonesians and I‚Äôd still think Koreans and Japanese are seen more favorably.

Are you saying Turks, who are muslim, dont know Indonesia is the nation with the most muslims in the world?? Dude, now youre trolling. 

Also, thats a relative statement. More favorably to what exactly? Specify. 

.
> Turks are racist towards Europeans? How? We‚Äôd rather be part of the EU than deal with the Middle East. Just because we went to war with Europeans doesn‚Äôt mean we hate them.

Seriously? Why are whites treated differently in Turkey with blind indignation? I've actually witnessed Turkish women look down upon Europeans. They dont allow outsiders to partake in their festivities. Did you read my last post?

Truthfully, with all due respect, Turkey has divided itself from Europe to the extent that it would be better that Turkey not be part of the EU. If it became an EU member there'd be chaos flowing far more into Europe as witnessed in Germany, Spain, England, Sweden and France. 

Turks want to be part of Europe yet they have this hatred about her. You dont respect her laws, rules, culture, way of life and especially her women. German women in Germany have been beaten up and raped by male Turkish strangers on the street for no reason. They desecrate churches and cemeteries. They disobey Europe's laws. This has been happening also in Sweden.  

Again, not trying to put you down but this is a reflection of what Europe as a whole feels strongly about Turkey.

When people talk about Turkey they talk about Turkey being muslim. They never refer to it as a christian country. European interactions with Turkish women have purported to be somewhat poor with some rather confusingly mixed signals thrown in. 

As far as the secular Turks go, they may be liberal-minded but their openness and friendly smiles end at any sign of foreign interactions with their women. To that extent, theres no difference from the temperament of their muslim counterparts. So we end up where we first started.

Of course, we are very proud of our country and that has nothing to do with religion. We despised religion so much that women were not allowed to cover their heads in the workplace up until Erdogan and religion is still controlled by the state because we don‚Äôt want it to become an enemy of the state.

Some criticism feels fairly consistent and this appears to be costing it a perfect score:

- Too many bland side quests.

- Issues with pacing. 

- Main game is good but a bit stretched out. 

- Too much fetch quest-y stuff, seems they are implying in the main story. 

That gives me FF12 vibes. 

I think we will be happy overall, but it sounds like it is just very very slightly missing the mark we thought it would hit.

On the positive most are saying this is the best FF since the PS2, despite giving many giving it 4/5 scores.

In the lead-up to the game‚Äôs launch, reporters pressed the game‚Äôs creative team about the fact that Valisthea seemed to¬†only be populated by white people. Producer Naoki Yoshida explained the decision, noting that despite being a fictional nation, it was very much based on European history. That reasoning doesn‚Äôt entirely add up in the final project considering that one of its kingdoms¬†draws from Africa¬†for design inspiration. But even if you buy that as a sensible explanation, it doesn‚Äôt explain why nearly every character I meet has the same body type and speaks in the same monotone, English droll. There‚Äôs little personality to the game‚Äôs cast, which makes it hard to differentiate its flat characters from one another.

>That‚Äôs ultimately where the story loses me. A promising setup that expertly contrasts the personal with the mythological fights for screen time with dull quests and indistinguishable characters that at times feel like Square Enix sneaking¬†some of its AI testing¬†in to pad out the runtime with filler. As a character told me during one subquest, ‚ÄúIf no one is listening to what you have to say, you may as well not say it.‚Äù

From a few reviews, it sounds like XVI separated side quests into two tiers, ones that provide major upgrades and have more gameplay and smaller side quests that are short with small rewards and little action. This is how XIV does side quests.

The smaller side quests that are short and don't have much gameplay are probably intended for those looking to immerse themselves in the lore and game world with little story tidbits. Some players who love lore hunting, story, and world-building will really love these. If you like gameplay and don't care too much about lore, you won't like these.

The larger and more involved quests with more gameplay and big rewards are intended for the players looking for more gameplay and upgrades. Some players who like the gameplay and progression loop will love these. Seems to be a bit of story in there as well.

Oddly enough, a lot of the reviewers (if not all traditional print/digital publications) didn't even touch on NG+, hunts, etc. while some also panned the side quests for lack of gameplay simultaneously. So I don't think we get the whole picture on the additional gameplay/side content aspect of the game with a lot of these reviews. It seems a majority of reviews really only cover an initial playthrough with some side questing.",harrison23,2023-06-21 17:32:28

Honestly never understand why some people care *so* much about sidequests.  They are literally optional yet its made to be the end of the world if there are fetch quests.  If they are in the main story then that is one thing (a valid complaint of FF14 filler quests).  And from the sound of it, there are stronger side quests later.",xlCalamity,2023-06-21 16:26:34

Also its a Switch game that also happens to have the single most ambitious physics engine in the industry, leading to a highly dynamic play experience, so some performance hiccups can be forgiven especially since the game is not super fast paced.

FFXVI is an ""action and just barely RPG"" game. Fights are heavily scripted and the game lives or dies on how responsive it feels in battle. There's no excuse for letting performance suffer, it should have been a number one priority.",sonicbrawler182,2023-06-21 20:49:40

Stats won't be customizable, not even through items (like how materia can change your stats in 7R) so they are less important. The skill tree system is more akin to a character action game than skill trees in the past ff titles.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

Also, I'm not sure which old FF games you're talking about, but certainly FF7 through FF9 offered a lot of meaningful exploration and plenty of openness.

I was hoping that they brought in some new writing talent for this game, but the demo made me think they probably haven‚Äôt. 

In particular the scene where the bearer drops the apple, and it makes a scene of how kind and patient Clive is about it. I just had to laugh because the game seriously wants you to think something like ‚Äòwow Clive‚Äôs a great guy look at how nice he is to his slaves‚Äô and it just plays that perfectly straight apparently not anticipating any irony or awkwardness in presenting it that way.

It wouldn‚Äôt have even been that difficult for them to have played it with more nuance and still had Clive come off as a nice, likable guy. A good comparison would be this scene in FFXII at about 2:45

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4oIj6zuf9yk&list=PL9wpzJw8GKy6LVCCHq3lThxUhpf91NP5w&index=4&pp=iAQB

There you see Van behaving in a kind and friendly way towards ‚ÄòLamont‚Äô while at the same time seeing Basch and Balthier cringing at how naive he is. It still makes Van look like a nice, likable guy, while at the same time playing the scene in such a way as to simultaneously highlight his ignorance.

I honestly was really wishing that the storytelling and character development would be at a similar level in XVI, but after playing the demo, reading some of the more critical reviews, and just generally being familiar with the storytelling style in XIV, I‚Äôm unfortunately not that optimistic anymore.",derridadaist,2023-06-21 21:28:59

FFXVI scoring 88 is amazing.

But your point that the series has been stagnant for 20 years until FFXVI is a tad hyperbolic. Especially considering the most controversial games, FFXV and FFXIII still scored in the 80s range.

I like Gita a lot, think their review was well written, and think that the backlash to it is ridiculous and often in bad faith; people read ""the slavery plot is executed badly"" and somehow see it as either saying ""don't ever do a slavery plot"" or respond like it's a criticism of the in-universe logic of Clive, a noble, needing to learn slavery is bad. There's also absolutely a lot of people who are terrible on Twitter and almost certainly sending harassment Gita's way.

I say all this to caveat that I'm not trying to defend harassment or say Gita is in the wrong, but: Gita's relationship with Twitter has always been incredibly toxic and they have a long, long history of finding bad takes they disagree with, addressed to them or otherwise, and elevating them with a quote tweet that only invites further discourse, often in an aggressive, ""I'm shit talking this person to my buds in the group chat"" tone. While a ton of the harassment is because of who Gita is and what they say, I do also think they have a pattern of leaning into it and rolling around in the firepit until they get burned, to the point I both read most of what they write and had to mute them on Twitter because even the secondhand fights they picked were unpleasant to engage with.",Milskidasith,2023-06-22 13:57:45

>Maehiro: If we‚Äôre thinking about the foundational themes of the gameplay, the truth is aside from what we‚Äôve already talked about we kind of had the idea of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make Final Fantasy V into an action game‚Äù.

>Q: Oho! When you think about FF5, the first thing that comes to mind is the job change system, but‚Ä¶?

>Maehiro: Rather than thinking of a job change system, better to imagine the ability customization system. In FF5, eventually you were able to learn all the abilities, but within that system you had to prioritize which jobs you wanted to level and customize your abilities, which settled your characters into different roles as a result.

>Q: If you‚Äôre talking about ability customization, it makes me think back to going wild with both blades and magic.

>Maehiro: Yes, exactly! (Laughs) That kind of playability where you can be surprised like ‚ÄúOh, I can combine things in this way!‚Äù, but in an action game where you‚Äôre operating in realtime, is the kind of thinking we were after.

>Takai: That kind of element, but instead of jobs we included the Eikons as a base. These days, there‚Äôs a lot of enthusiasm for players broadcasting and streaming their games, so if the different streamers had different loadout combinations we think it gives the viewers the opportunity to go ‚ÄúOhh! That kind of combination exists too‚Äù. In this way, we wanted to develop ‚Äúa game that plays differently for every player‚Äù to the extent that we‚Äôre able.

Leaving aside the fact that there were Black and brown people in medieval Europe, this justification rings hollow given that several locations take open inspiration from north Africa and the Middle East, with towns that, for example, riff on Islamic architectural traditions and attire, but are predominantly or exclusively populated by anglophone white people (I hedge, here, simply because I haven't been around and talked to everybody). I find the deletion of people of colour from these spaces more sinister than the racial stereotypes of older Final Fantasies, particularly in a game that wants to talk about overcoming structural injustice and bringing people together. That ""togetherness"" is worth fighting for, but it's characterised here by what it excludes.‚Äù

And the publish a review of the same game that just shits on it for whatever reason. Should those scores be counted equally even if one might be dubious for whatever reason?

And I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but the writer is from the Heavensward expansion. FFXIV had a different writer for the base game, Heavensward, and Stormblood. The last two expansions had the same writer, who has nothing to do with this game.

And it's funny that you used that scene as a comparison, since I've heard other reviewers compare this game to Vagrant Story and FF Tactics, who were all made by the same guy who also made FF XII. 

So I wouldn't take Polygons word when a lot of legit reviewers like ACG or Fextralife are praising the story.

If you are more ambitious with your story than short chains of discrete, disconnected quests, which is what I would expect from a good JRPG, an open world is off the table. 

As someone who plays games primarily for story, ‚Äúopen world‚Äù is probably the biggest turn-off you can label a game with.

But from what I've heard, those books present a world with a similar structure of culturally entrenched slavery, and they literally take the piss out of Hermione for protesting against it, and conclude with Harry being praised for being a nice slave owner. Whether that's a legit take of those books or not, I don't know, but either way it serves as an example of how saying 'that's just the structure of the world' won't mean much if the story handles that structure poorly. 

As I mentioned above, I'm not forming a final opinion of the whole game based on 2 hours of it, but I did feel like that scene was clumsy enough that I'm not sure I'm going to be thrilled with where it takes the issue. But again, hopefully I'm wrong and will be pleasantly surprised.",derridadaist,2023-06-22 02:55:37

Yet people keep giving Nintendo a pass for running games at 720p at 30 fps with drops.

Speaking of that the story is also a joke. They recycle the same cutscene 4 times (Meeting the sage and hearing about the past), it's the same speech and everything each time it's hilarious.

I feel like TotK falls into the trap that all good sandbox games do where what you get out of it is directly correlated to how much you engage with the systems; it benefits greatly from the Zelda IP which draws people in past the lackluster story and character development (while the series has always had strong character IDENTITY it‚Äôs character development is typically weak or limited to one or two characters per title) to engage with the world-class exploration and sandbox aspect.",DeathByTacos,2023-06-21 17:16:42

Funniest thing about that consensus was them classifying Afghans as white, but their next-door neighbors, Pakistanis, were considered Asian. Lmao.

The Dhalmekians (or Dhalmeks? I don't remember which term it is) are wearing Ottoman-era/general Arab Caliphates-era inspired clothing, but its people don't look like Middle Easterners at all. So it is a valid point of criticism.

Disclaimer though, I didn't read the Eurogamer review, I'm not going to either, I didn't watch any trailer fleshing out the world of FF16 over the years either, I want to go into this game completely blind, I have only played the demo.

The point overall is that they put majority of their effort into side questing as that's how you are expected to do in the game.

In Final Fantasy, you are expected to mainly stick to the main story. The biggest mistake is putting in side quests at all instead of a few side stories. Take FFVII, for example (the original), how many side quests are there that aren't just gameplay? Yuffie, Vincent, Wutai, and Lucrezia's Cave I think. Then you have the Gold Saucer and chocobo breeding for gameplay only. Finally, the WEAPONs for battle content.

This was the case with most Final Fantasy games - a couple side stories, some secret gameplay stuff, and some superbosses. The problem is that over the ears open world RPGs and the like polluted the games with side quests and so people got mad when there wasn't much.

I remember people being disappointed by the amount of side quests in FFVII Remake.",Writer_Man,2023-06-21 16:42:49

I have not played a game with less thought put into how the sidequests were presented or how they play out than FF7R

Find 3 cats. Find 3 chocobos. Kill these things here exactly where I tell you they are. Theres no variance at all. Its ""collect quest at point A, walk to point B, return to point A"" with 0 story relevance or character development.

FF7R quest quality is not even remotely close to Witcher 3 level. The one person who gets progressive character development as you do side quests is Chadley and he is literally a robot. Not even calling him a robot due to his emotions. Hes an actual robot created by Shinra.

Witcher 3 literally has a well written story behind almost every side quest. If you're roleplaying Geralts character the way you behave in these quests might even affect which decision you might make for the main quest ending. Thats a sign of immersion. When I am doing Witcher 3 side quests I am playing as Geralt and my actions affect the world around me. When I am doing FF7R side quests I am thinking of it as a chore and thinking about the reward.

I would rather play an arpg where the whole game including the side quests are literally about endless grinding and gambling than go through FF7R's quests again. At least that has interesting loot and is addictive.",[deleted],2023-06-22 05:52:57

FFVII Remake took a lot of creative gambles and (for better or worse) pissed off lots of fans of FFVII. So don't sit there and act like this game was an easy slam dunk.

Swatches of More Korean Cushion Foundations - Skin Tone MAC 25-30 / Korean Shade 23-25 [Part 2],111,2023-07-21 19:10:08,https://i.redd.it/ysn5bki8addb1.jpg,AsianBeauty,"Hi everyone! i'm back with more swatches of korean cushion foundations, as I just got a couple new ones to swatch and try out. I'll likely do a part 3 including espoir and unleashia in the near-ish future if this helps.

Please view part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/152dprk/swatches_of_many_different_korean_cushion/), where I swatched CLIO, rom&nd, JSM, sulwhasoo, and some from holika holika and too cool for school.

I also used **rom&nd's nu zero** cushion (25) and **jungsaemmool essential nuder** (23) as a control, as I wasn't able to recreate the same lighting I had last time (not sure why) üò≠. I've also already swatched the nu zero in 23 before, but wanted to use it as a comparison of the bloom in coverfit.

I'll be doing reviews of these individually instead of my previous approach, but let me know what you prefer! To recap, **I have dry skin** and prone to dry patches, and prefer light coverage.

* **MISSHA**
   * **Shade Range + Inclusivity** (applies for both versions of Missha's cushion): With its flexible shade range that goes not only to 25, **but to 27 and 31**, this cushion brings inclusivity to a level that other korean-owned brands cannot. *Note that in Korea, you will only be able to buy til shade 23 in most MISSHA retailers / chains, but you can find the 25-31 shades easily online.*
      * Whilst this was a little more orangey than my HG cushions (rom&nd's nu zero and JSM's essential nuder) I found it helped color correct some of the dullness in my face, which I didn't really mind.
   * **Magic Cover Lasting Cushion** (shade 25) has a semi-matte finish, and has medium coverage, but a thin consistency, which makes it easy to work with. Whilst initially it applied nicely on the skin, I noticed dry patches and uneveness forming within several minutes of application, on my nose, near my jaw, and more. It also emphasized any small texture bumps I had compared to the glow cushion, which I wasn't a fan of. I think you can see the result from the swatch too. I already came with the pretense knowing that this would probably be an **oily skin girl's HG,** but it just wouldn't work with me.
   * **Glow Cushion** (shade 25) has a slightly glowy finish, and has a slightly thicker consistency than the other cushion, but the cushion holding the product is a bit stiffer, allowing better control of the amount of product that comes out (The cushion stiffness reminds me of rom&nd's cushions, compared to the average sponge which is super soft). Overall, I noticed this clung onto some very minor dry spots around my nose, and had some minor creasing around my lips, but nothing a cotton bud and gentle removal couldn't resolve. The one ick I have about this product is that it's really easy to smudge. I generally don't use much setting powder bc it can look cakey, but I layer setting spray throughout my routine. I noticed even after my spray dried and as i was doing my eyeliner and my wrist gently tapped my cheeks, it would smudge. Definitely not transfer-proof on masks as well. **TL;DR: I like this cushion a lot, and prefer it a lot more over the Magic Cover Lasting Cushion, as it has more glowiness and hydration, as well as less dry patches and clinging**.
* **rom&nd**
   * **Nu Zero Cushion** has been reviewed in part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/152dprk/swatches_of_many_different_korean_cushion/). Please read it to understand and compare with the Bloom Fit.
   * **Bloom in CoverFit Cushion** (shade 23) is a japan-exclusive launch, but you can get it on amazon.co.jp and they will ship worldwide. Fun fact, it arrived in next day shipping for me - isn't that wild? Before we get into it, I just wanna say.. the packaging is actually gorgeous, and the puff it comes with it is so cute as well. [Just look at it!](https://imgur.com/7SAcwdx) The cushion completely hides my pores, and has a silky texture that dries down to a semi-matte finish. The best thing about this though, in my opinion - is it has a pinkish, warm undertone that *isn't overbearing (the JSM's 25, or holika holika's tanning 06)* acting as a CC - covering any dullness of your pores. It's also really gentle on the skin, which I appreciate. As for dry patches - I had very few dry patches, despite its semi-matte finish. As you can see from the swatch, it melts right into the skin and evens it out. It also is really hard to smudge once dried down, which is nice! **Compared to the Nu Zero - I think I'd still pick up the Nu Zero because of the 25 being such a close match to my skin tone, but I'll definitely use this more often in my winter time :)**
* **APRILSKIN** Ultra Slim Cushion (shade 23) is definitely what you should pick up if you hate the feeling of makeup: Out  of all the cushions I've ever tried, this is probably one of the most lightweight. Whilst it doesn't have huge, pore blurring properties, this gives you the ""my skin but better"" look - mostly evening out your skin tone. As you can see from the swatch, it is very thin and doesn't cover blemishes well compared to others (like the bloom in coverfit). For this specifically, I would recommend application with a spatula, because it's way easier to apply it thinly than with the puff, but it's still ok for reapplication. Because of its lightweight application, it is easy to avoid dry spots, and clean any areas that need a bit more exfoliation. I **recommend this to people with fewer blemishes on the skin and just want to enhance your look.**
* **Etude House Double Lasting** (shade 21) - one thing I wanted to note is, I bought multiple from this line bc it was so hyped. I noticed Etude's 21 is darker than the average 21 shade. As for the application, I wasn't a huge fan due to its emphasis on my dry spots with its heavier coverage. However, I can imagine this would work for a fuller glam look, or for those with a different skin type. I probably won't be picking this up again.

I hope this helps - please let me know if you have any questions. If you have any cushions that are your HG that you think would be a fit for me, please recommend them! I'm always trying new cushions. I hope this helps to people who are just starting out, or need help with finding their shade, bc it took me a long time to find mine.",PasteIIe,2023-07-21 19:44:06

There isn't any player interaction in this video outside everybody standing around a boss whacking it like the Kzarka boss in BDO.  To me it actually looks more like BDO 2 right.  Idk.  There's a lot we don't know. I'll want to know more about the economy and everything.  There isn't enough information about the game yet for me to really be excited for this. The sudden name change when everybody was excited about Archage 2 has me skeptical that it's actually not even going to feel like a successor to the game and that they know that.  Instanced housing is already going to take away a lot of what people enjoyed from the first one.  Idk.  It doesn't seem like they expanded on what made Archeage great.

Yes, I read that. This would be all cool if the first Archeage was some kind of masterpiece in terms of story. You know, like Warcraft level lore and IP, but let's be real, there was barely any story delivered when going through Archeage. Archeage just has this stigma of a game that was completely ruined by its developers.

I guess my question was more rhetorical, because I know exactly why they are using it. They are too lazy and greedy to create a completely new IP. That's the answer.

And yes, it's fairly obvious from their answers, that this time it's going to be a more story driven PVE game, they're going for that console market hard. Console players don't have any negative feelings towards Archeage IP, so it makes sense.",General-Oven-1523,2024-09-26 13:47:00

People don't make MMOs because they're your friend. They don't make new IPs because it's a risk. The company wants and needs money. This game is going to earn them at least a billion dollars to survive another five or ten years until they do something new. Or, it's a smash hit and one of the best MMOs ever made, and survives for another twenty. Both scenarios are possible.

If you traveled safe zone to safe zone, your trade packs made made less money than if you traveled to contested/more distant zones. Further trade pack runs into PvP zones had more risk but generated more money. 

As more PvP happened in a zone, they cycle into open war then safe/peace for an hour so people could safely make trade pack runs. Repeated trade pack turn ins would slowly lower value of the same trade pack so if you wait for peace time, you get less value because so is every one else. Going during war time was much more risky but also worth more money.

Plenty of different ways reduce risk. Bring friends. Make you runs at less populated times. Move your trade packs one zone at a time when they are in peace time. Take longer route that is less likely to be watched.",wheresbrazzers,2024-09-26 01:35:38

Is there a Korean cushion that matches Maybelline's fit me 125?,3,2023-11-09 23:51:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/17rqqwx/is_there_a_korean_cushion_that_matches/,MakeupAddiction,"hi! so i‚Äôm around a shade 118 in the maybelline fit me matte and poreless foundations and a shade 23 in most korean foundations, but you do want to take into account that many korean cushions run a bit lighter and tend to have a pink base. i definitely recommend going for companies like laneige or romand for maybe either a shade 23 or 25 because the cushions from clio, wakemake, or other companies that market exclusively to koreans tend to have more limited shade ranges that run brighter. i have normal/dry and acne prone skin and i‚Äôve found that the romand nu zero cushion wears very well and looks super natural on my skin. it‚Äôs an affordable one and one of my favorites out of the ones i‚Äôve tried and has a neutral base.",almondmilktofu,2023-11-12 03:12:21

I recomend to always do this with any retinol for a period of at least 6 months because your skin needs to get used to the retionol first. Purging is normal for about 3 months with retionol but dry skin should and can be helped with a good moisturiser. At daytime I opt for  essence and serums. Once every week I use a Exfoliant to keep my skin from lucking dull with all the dead skincells . This routine has really helped me get beter skin.

Education and childcare sponsored by government may work in short term, I wonder how they going to afford, but parents are likely to feel alienated and resentful if their children raised by government and not them, and in turn that would cause next generation to want children even less.

1. Increase wages so that having a partner, let alone supporting a child is feasible 
2. Have better rent control so that people can afford to live somewhere they are proud of, let alone have a family

I include South Korea and Japan in the wide Western world. 

The standard politically correct and feminist explanation for the low birth rate is lack of equality in the workplace, childcare care which is unaffordable and lack of equality in the home.

However if that explanation were true, then you would expect countries with cheaper child care, more equal workplaces, cheaper housing and more equal parenting to have higher fertility rates. The brutal reality is, they don't. 

Look at the Nordic countries, which are all more feminist societies than average. All the Nordic countries have a fertility rate below the replacement level. More feminism won't solve the problem.

So would you like the politically incorrect reason for the low birth rate in the developed world? Too much feminism and too much sexually equality. Men use economic power, women use sexual power. In world in which men dominate employment, women had no choice but to get married and have children.

When women have equal or greater economic power than men, large numbers of men become obsolete. Women can choose not to marry and not to have kids. 

You may say that is great but in the long run it means feminism is doomed. A movement without children, is a movement without a future.

More feminism in the form of cheaper childcare and more protections for women in the workplace isn't going to work.",ChemistryFederal6387,2024-05-09 16:30:10

Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is not a financial proposition. Yet nearly everyone in the pro-natalist camp is firmly convinced that it is. 30+ years of failure of all of their policies doesn't convince them to re-evaluate and consider the possibility that TFR may not be about money.

Socialist policies meant to increase TFR have failed in Poland, Hungary, Iran, Japan, Russia... they will for sure fail in South Korea as well.

The easiest predictor of high TFR is national mood. Kazakhstan grew from TFR 1.8 to 3.2 and keeps on growing. All while modernizing (thus sinking the argument that modernity and higher incomes plunge fertility). Meanwhile, highly religious and pro-natalist Tunisia, Morocco or Iran have plunging fertility rates (thus sinking the argument that religion matters so much).

South Korea's national mood is sour. And has been for over a decade. And it will not change anytime soon - in part because it cannot change.

Of course, social media doesn't help either. Neither does the extremism and female privilege. Men serve in the military for two years. And there's no way to avoid it. Yet until 3 years ago **all** gov't programs went to women. All. Not a single pro-male program existed. Now there is one and the pro-women programs have been scaled down significantly. And feminists went berserk about it.

Almost every failed society dealt with collapsing birth rates towards the tail end and tried the same shit we are now to solve it. None of it worked.

This is why events such as major wars have served to be great levelers (there‚Äôs a book titled this about it) for society. It forces the need of such things like procreation on societies through a major loss of men on the population creating a scarcity dynamic that‚Äôs not just perceived (like 80/20), but is actually in existence.

Better just bomb Seoul. Bombing a city out of existence causes *less* damage than rent control. The experience of Stockholm (or more recently NYC) should inform that pretty clearly.

Also, living where ""you're proud of"" is peak entitlement.

Only slight disagreement on men's role.  In a lot of middle-class, two-earner families the men are carrying a huge part of the burden, making lives much more bearable for the women.

It's also true that the only societies that have high birth rates right now are societies with very low levels of education and low levels of technological/economic development.  What is rarely discussed is that it may be possible to completely revise the costs/benefits equations associated with having children and associated social systems/arrangements to address the problem.  When countries go to war, face major pandemics or environmental catastrophes, they will often respond by completely reordering their societies to survive.  South Korea appears to be unable or unwilling to even contemplate the types of huge changes necessary to reverse the gradual population collapse it is facing.  It would take huge leaps in imagination, innovation and investment of resources to potentially succeed.

We define a developed country by the state of it's economy, and the stressors that come with a developed country are embedded within the class tension of capitalism.

The more integrated capitalism becomes, the more individualistic the society becomes. Consequently, competitiveness becomes more pervasive and intense between individuals within an increasing amount of contexts. Another consequence is the increased disempowering of the labor class which is achieved through the close relationship that inevitably emerges between those with power and harmonious goals, such as successful members of the capitalist class and politicians. It is this very mechanism through which the capitalist class can effectively increase pressure and demand on the labor class. 

However, a threshold is eventually crossed that causes an increasing amount of laborers to disengage with the support systems of capitalism, in one way or another. One of the big ones is simply being too fucking stressed and overworked to want to put in more work of finding a suitable mate, the steps towards making a child, and the tremendous work that is involved in caretaking for children.

The government will attempt to address the issue but a meaningful solution is avoided because that is almost guaranteed to disempower the capitalist class in some way. And that's true here as well because the demand and pressure put upon members of the labor class has not been addressed. 

It's fucking simple... Allow more members of the labor class more leisure time and they will make more children. Then make it easier on the parents to raise those children and they will have more children.

average U.S. annual salary in Q4 of 2023 was $59,384

Average cost of daycare in US per month 1300

The average monthly grocery bill of a family of three in the US is $902

Giving birth costs $18,865 on average, including pregnancy, delivery and postpartum care with insurance 30k without (many people get laid off after getting pregnant so that means no insurance) 

The average rent in the United States is $1,515/month (where I live that‚Äôd be with roommates)

The average home price in the United States was $495,100 in the second quarter of 2023 but let‚Äôs be honest most under 30 people are renting. 

Average maternity/ paternity leave in US is 17 days. 
That‚Äôs if you have a job that offers it at all some don‚Äôt or again have laid you off because you had a kid. This is both not enough time for the mother to recover but is bad for the newborn and increases the likelihood that they‚Äôll have emotional regulation/anxiety issues later in life. 

Public schools here are deteriorating so soon Charter schools or private schools are going to be your best bet unfortunately the latter cost a fuck ton. 

That‚Äôs before you account in college expenses, extra curricular, activities,tutors, car payments, gas, car pool, additional childcare cost and the majority of would be parents have an existing mountain of student loan debt. Our parents are working longer so we can‚Äôt even call grandma to babysit. And godforbid your kid has medical issues/a disability that requires additional medical payments.

You used to be able to support a family on a minimum wage income now you can barely support yourself. If you want to comfortably afford a family now you have to be pulling well over 100k pretty much anywhere within America even then you could still get fucked.


Our society in its current state doesn‚Äôt offer much in terms of support for young families. There‚Äôs no incentive to have children and every reason not to.

Saying the population decline is due to misogyny/misandry/4b is basically just clickbait, and Westerners are getting bamboozled by it. I see it posted on reddit every week. It's economical reasons for most or average people.

In the first place, I'd say baby rearing in Korea is different from the West. The West's philosophy is ""lets have a baby despite (bad/questionable) situation, because everything will work out"". Or see parenting as getting their kid to 20ish and telling them ""ok you're an adult, pay for your own college, good luck."" That's not the case in Korea (or other Asian countries). In Korea, people want a solid foundation, their t's crossed, and i'd dotted to prepare for a baby. This means owning a home and having enough money to pay for after-school academies (""hagwons""), and university too.

Housing has been the biggest political issue for every election. Simply put, no one can afford one. Everyone is fighting for housing for either an investment, family, retirement, money, etc.

I think most Westerners know that quirky fact that kids go to school 9am~11pm. They go to public school, then after school academies. What most don't know, these academies are fucking expensive. Average families pay USD $500~1000+ every month just for 1 kid. Kids go to these academies/hagwons because they're competing against their classmates for the national university exam. They want to go to a good university to MAYBE beat the odds for 1 of the handful of good jobs out there. That's the grind. People go to hagwons/private academies from elementary school to all the way to university to even get certificates, english proficiency tests, etc for buff their resume. For maybe some couples, that could be their retirement savings instead. 

No one really knows how to tackle these two main issues without backlash. The hagwon system is pretty cursed. If there's any kind of regulations talked about, parents of middle class and lower will complain because the rich will/can easily afford to hire private tutors (like they did during covid lockdowns when hagwons closed for a while) and thus will do better on the national exam. The government put a curfew on hagwons to close by 10 pm, but many of them illegally continue classes past curfew.  I believe China is trying to tackle similar issues too by somehow regulating private tutoring. 

Add on other issues: rising costs, overworked & underpaid, worried about retirement, lack of parent leave, no vacation, burned out after college and finally want to rest, and so on.",0dyssia,2024-05-09 19:18:45

I agree btw about men taking on - especially in middle class society - far more of the family care role!

¬†¬†I had originally noted that my husband had to pass on a lucrative opportunity that would have had him traveling as an onsite consultant because it would have meant that all the child care would have fallen on me ¬†and I am a professional. I wasn‚Äôt going to quit and I work some crazy hours occasionally. ¬†But it seemed too long for my comment.¬†

¬†That was my emphasis about both men and women wanting to limit children to one or two. The opportunity costs are high for both, especially when one (ie because of education or experience) has more opportunity to begin with. This is why the middle/middle upper tends to limit ¬†families despite being more affluent. ¬†

From what I know. Wealthy women do not pump out a lot of babies.

Which brings me back to my og response.

Women who aren‚Äôt having babies explaining when they will have babies isn‚Äôt totally reliable.

We have to factor in free will.

Maybe women just don‚Äôt want to have babies when they have a true genuine choice of their own free will.

But what are your thoughts?

Modern SK was founded specifically with the role of major companies in mind, and they are assumed to be integral parts of not just the economy, but the nation as a whole.

I would have to do a lot of research to really explain it better, but here in the US many people don't remember or never knew GM went bankrupt.  If Samsung went bankrupt there would be chaos, not just because of the economic impact but because it would represent a failure of the nation as a whole and what it means to be South Korean.

Guess that's what I'm getting at.  Getting a job at Samsung means a lot more socially than someone in the US getting a job at Ford.  Ford is just another company, there are countless alternatives, and many of them are seen as just as prestigious or more so.  Samsung is Samsung.",SmallSituation6432,2024-05-09 15:12:10

Making contraceptives illegal?

That has been tried in Romania. Contraceptives, abortion and divorce were made illegal in 1967 (look up Decree 770). It introduced mandatory monthly gynecological check-ups for all fertile women to register pregnancies as soon as possible and enforce punishments if 9 months later the kid wasn't there.

It ""worked"" for exactly 18 months. Afterwards the TFR went down again and continued to go down all the way till 2012. The abolition of all restrictions in 1989 didn't make a dent.

>I don't think Hungary is a fair comparison to US. They don't have such a large and prosperous middle and upper class. They stand to gain far more from completely not having to pay income taxes.

I am so tired of this cope. Total Fertility Rate is a human nature issue not an economics. Americans are not special at all.

Wealthier areas than the US (like Switzerland or Shenzhen) tried versions of what you propose. The results are the same: nobody cared and the TFR stayed where it was.

>What would you propose?

There is nothing the State can do economically to change this.

In the 1920s the West had even lower fertility than today. Then it recovered. The State did nothing then either.

What can be done is unpopular and depends on the country.

In the case of South Korea, I already said: 

* Remove female privilege
* crackdown on the insane working culture (US has this problem too, but South Korea is 100x worse). Yes, by force if necessary. Including by male-favoring affirmative action, punitive measures for long work schedules, etc. It's easy to do in South Korea (a more centralized economy). Harder to do in the US. And political suicide.
* build public parks and walkable cities so teens and small children can be out and about and gain independence faster (South Korea does that but not enough; this measure would be political suicide in car-centric helicopter-parenting Karen USA)
* incentivize children activities (amusement parks should be tax and VAT free)
* incentivize the exclusion of childless people (impossible to do in the USA - but doable in South Korea)
* subsidize propaganda (movies, books, music) that actively shame childlessness and that actively promotes having 2 children as the bare minimum norm and everyone else as abnormal freaks

And that's just the beginning. None of this will happen because it harms women. So... enjoy the decline.

None of the economic approaches will work. They will cost a lot of money and make society poorer, but will not solve the ""problem"".

I'll gladly explain.

So, as a man who just graduated high school, if you can't get into a hyper-competitive college (and they all are), you go for 21 months into the military. If you do get in college, you'll be shipped into the military afterwards.

Either way, you start your career two years after women.

Once you do, ***every step of the way*** there's female-favoring affirmative action (institutionalized misandry). The only way to overcome that is to work even more than 100% of your female competitors. And to do that means forgoing a social life - which translate into the highest rates of male loneliness in the world.

If you choose not to work harder to overcome institutionalized misandry, you'll have a lower quality of life and you won't *afford* a social life - which still means a big chance of ending up alone (albeit smaller than in the first scenario).

In the past, this was somewhat balanced because women would lose about two years of career trajectory by having two kids. This is no longer the case today.

>Nearly 80% of South Korean men in their 20s say that men are discriminated against. Barely 30% of men over 60 agree, making their views indistinguishable from those of women in their 20s or 60s. \[[Source](https://www.economist.com/international/2024/03/13/why-the-growing-gulf-between-young-men-and-women)\]

You may disagree, but when 80% of such a large group agree on something (even though they vote differently), the issue is a very serious one.

The government(s) took a lot more radical action when only 30% of women *felt* discriminated against. Nobody even bothered to investigate whether the feeling was grounded in reality or not.

Finally, two years ago, an explicit anti-feminist president won the election with the promise to at least try to abolish institutionalized misandry.

Using hundreds of millions of western funds, feminists launched multiple campaigns and efforts to undermine the president every step of the way. Still, for the first time in history, one pro-male program appeared. And it's the number 1 enemy of every single feminist and the majority of women.

Foreigners and old(er) men continue to dismiss the issue - all while calling for the same men subjected to never-ending institutionalized misandry to... *man up*.

Do you even read what I said.

I said most women when having the full ability to have free will - will choose not to have babies.

I said some would.

I‚Äôm not going to restate it again. Just reread the previous response.

If women don‚Äôt want to have babies. As is their right. And is their free will.

You saying that policies and ‚Äúfree time‚Äù will change that

Is implying what?

That their minds will magically change from something they don‚Äôt want to do because you‚Äôve instituted policies and ‚Äúfree time‚Äù

How can you not make that connection.

Or

Why can you not accept that maybe they just don‚Äôt want to have babies and they made that choice of their own free will.

It‚Äôs not a money problem or a free time problem.

Rich/wealthy women have money and free time and they are not having a lot of babies.

So why is that? I thought they just needed the money and ‚Äúfree time‚Äù?

I‚Äôm also telling you anybody can say anything.

The fact that you think that if you gave the women who claim they would have babies under certain conditions - those conditions. That they will magically choose to get pregnant that exact instance all those conditions are met.

Is laughable and not realistic.

You want me to answer your question.

I have.

A woman‚Äôs free will is the deciding factor.

The only thing that can change that is if a woman is in a disadvantaged position. Where she makes choices to survive.

But that has nothing to do with free will.

I‚Äôm telling you there is nothing that can be done.

It‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs free will choice to have babies or not to have babies. And this is the choice a lot of women have made. And that‚Äôs their decision. and that‚Äôs what they want.

No policies that truly enforce and allow free will. Will ever change that. That‚Äôs my position and stance.

That‚Äôs why the op post is funny.

It‚Äôs like nobody accepts that most women don‚Äôt want to have children if they had the choice.

You just have to accept the free will of another human being.

XP Most Korean brands have scents to make their product smell fresh or floral, and the Laneige one in particular has a strong scent.

Also, it's worth noting that I tried the Pony Effect Everlasting cushion for a few months and quite liked the dewy finish, though sometimes I got self conscious that I looked too oily or shiny. I didn't get any adverse reaction to whatever gives it the dewy glow, and it didn't cause any breakouts so that's a plus.

The radical black nationalists used to join the Nation of Islam, now they join BLM groups. Not every BLM protester fits into this box but alot do, especially their leaders.

Black rights activists like Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali supported the KKK and sat down with them at meetings because they shared the same goal of segregation.

Many BLM activists support segregation, they want black only spaces, black only businesses. Their call to de-fund police and allow their communities to police themselves is a form of segregation, they don't care if police are arresting white people as long as the police don't come into black neighborhoods.

It's not some democratic conspiracy, a certain percentage of black Americans have always believed the way to solve their problems is through segregation.",[deleted],2022-06-12 11:58:48

BLM specifically want to abolish all punishment, Patrisse Cullors is a punishment abolitionist. Meaning if a person murders someone else, the murderer can just decline the punishment.

She thinks BLM will initiate the utopia and non of this will be needed because when she takes power crimes will just stop occurring anyway.

Oh, and non of this applies to white people. She still celebrated the murder verdict in the George Floyd trial, sending Derek Chauvin to prison.

Tekken 8 went in the trash direction all the way on here and it stems from the ghost battle. The game remembers your moves and places you against people who can win against your ghost. Now correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but rank is rank f*ck a battle set up by the cpu just give me a good ol ranked fight. It feels like your not fighting the people but just Tekken on this one. Not to mention they lag moves horribly on this one, like completely different combos come out from what u press. Sh*t is just foul this game.

It doesn't have as much singleplayer content as other fighting games at first glance, but between the story mode and the pseudo arcade mode thing, combined with the new ghost mode, I imagine there's enough offline content to well surpass 60 hours if you get really into it, even without labbing. $70 is a bit steep to me, but going by my general rule of thumb of $1 for 1 hour of gameplay, it seems like it could easily clear that threshold with online play.

All the new characters look great (I'd totally be either a Victor or a Reina main), the music has a lot of real bangers, and visually it's probably one of the prettiest games I've ever seen. It's so pretty I can only consistently run it on the lowest settings lol but it still looks good. I hadn't been interested in Tekken until recently, so I decided to try emulating 5 since I kept hearing that it was one of the GOATs and try the demo for 8 while I was at it. It feels much better to me so far and is very beginner friendly for a Tekken.

This and Infinite Wealth are the biggest games I'm excited for this year, and it's wild to me that they come out within a couple days of each other. Shame I won't be able to buy either of them for a while.",DragonianXylak,2024-01-24 08:28:24

Both were female rulers that, due to the moral direction Confucian leaders desired to adhere to, were posthumously downplayed and maligned to reinforce the idea that women were not fit to rule. I agree that Seondeok was not the best choice for Korea, but modern scholars are a lot more skeptical of the negative claims about her (and Wu Zetian) made by Joseon-era historians because of the narrative they were compelled to retroactively enforce. Korean history as it is traditionally taught is based largely, and justifiably, on the works of later scholars because it is what has been available to study, but it's important to remember that much of what we read from history is almost never told without a bias or slant.

And of course as OP has already said, Seondeok was incredibly important in uniting Korea; she was the one that set all of the pieces into place for it to happen. Her alliance with China is portrayed as betraying domestic for foreign interests by Confucian scholars, but she did it without giving in to China's actual demands, and it was necessary to secure Silla's place in interkingdom politics. The move was integral in uniting Korea in the first place. Seondeok was not a stellar military leader and I get wanting someone who excelled in something tangible like conquest or war. But her diplomacy and political maneuvering thrusted Silla into a far more important and favorable role in the region and that should not be downplayed or understated. (In-game actualization is another story, though, I do wish they did more with alliances or governors with her to better accentuate this fact).",clapyourhands59,2017-12-07 23:30:09

She was far more willing to give out posts by merit rather than traditional favoritism. Of course there was rampant favoritism. But compared to other Silla monarchs you saw a lot of people get their posts based on merit. Her chief three generals were all great examples of this.

Even though you don't cite anything I sort of agree with you. However it was the bone system that actually got her the throne and as such fate let the great two Kims get into the position that would lead them to glory when Silla united - long after she died. I don't know how Seondeok herself is responsible for this.


>12.) Somebody on this forum claimed she was so hated that she was killed by her people in a fort after a month and a half siege. Not sure where this came from at all. She died while there was a rebellion going on by a noble called Lord Bidam. By all accounts Bidam led the revolt against her under the guise that she was a""women and unfit to rule"". His real reason other than his rampant sexism was that as discussed before Seondeok helped to further centralize the Silla. She took away a lot of power from local lords and handed them off the the central government. Nobles like Bidam were pissed so they rebelled. Bidam's rebellion failed by the way a few days after her death. Her death by all accounts was recorded as natural as she was an estimated 60-65 years old by then (historians debate her exact age).

It is a theory that she died during the revolt. Some sources like the Samguk Sagi which are notably full of legend and mythical events taking place during the revolt such as the falling star say that she did die afterwards. However some people make conjecture that she actually died due to this revolt. I'm guessing that these people may be making theories because they hate her because she was a Silla queen who sold out the Korean people. 

>13.) After Silla victory over their rivals in 668 via a Tang alliance that she set up, the Tang occupied 4/5ths of the peninsula because they thought they had a claim to the land because of their alliance. In eight years Silla after guerrilla warfare and a tributary agreement gained the peninsula from the Taedong river south. Keep in mind this was after Seondeok had died and the Tang reneged on their previous agreement not to occupy those lands. You can argue this is Seondeok's fault (stupidly) for allowing a ambitious Tang into the fold. But considering the Tang always had interest in the Korean peninsula before and after Seondeok and bound to help one of the Three Kingdoms in some way it was probably the smartest move on her part to subplant Baekje and Goguryeo as Tang's main Korean ally in order to gain a temporary alliance with the region's super power of the time.
A lot of the accounts cited against her were accounts used by Confucian Joseon scholars who specifically were against female equity and rulers. They painted Seondeok in a horrible light to specifically justify the philosophy behind primogeniture and succession being male only. Contemporary historians generally agree that she was a relatively good and able ruler of the Silla dynasty and set the stage for Korean unification.
A lot of the opinions do not mean to be sexist (some of them do), but they do seem to draw from an outdated and tainted understanding of Seondeok planted by a philosophy that had no qualms about advancing a sexist historiography.
I really really really hope more people (including my fellow Koreans) do more research before blasting inaccurate criticism. While I don't think she is the best choice for Korea's leader in Civ VI, I do think she is perfectly fine choice with a kick ass crown.

You say ""a lot of accounts cited"" but you don't source the Samguk Sagi or Samguk Yusa in any of your claims about her which leads me to believe that you didn't go much farther than the English Wikipedia. I'm searching for non-Korean sources and it is difficult to find things because a lot of it is covered with references to the fictional drama. Regardless she is also not at fault for what happened after her death. If you actually were Korean, you would know that a lot of this comes out of hate for Silla from people outside of Gyeongsang. Although many people from other regions also harbor no ill-will towards Gyeongsang aside from petty rivalries in sports etc., Also many men hate what the drama did to her history and they view it as an effeminate and revisionist historical fiction. Likewise much interest in her stems from women's studies abroad. I am not 100% against such women's studies departments but you can guess that there are many people who are against such ""useless Neo-Marxism"" such as conservatives. And frankly, some of the ""historical"" accounts of her on English websites source nothing but foreign claims about her written by sources from international women's studies. [Even the accounts such as these](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Queen_Seondeok_of_Silla) that I link use such works in their citations. The more women's studies sources that you link and the more praise you hear for her.

There has been a strong anti-Neo-Confucian slant coming from the west since the end of WW2. This is because Neo-Confucianism really hurt the rights of women specifically in China and Korea after its adoption. [See this paper](http://otherwise.philosophystudentassociation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Kim_Sohee.pdf) for more info. This feminist attack on a fundamental part of Chinese and Korean culture obviously faces a backlash and there are hundreds or thousands of papers written against Neo-Confucianism through many forms of lenses including feminism, Neo-Marxism, and more rational critiques.

Japan never really adopted with Neo Confucianism in the same way but some effects were felt and it was definitely influential even in the Sakoku period, although people still tried to merge ""Chinese thinking"" with ""Japanese thinking.""",XavierAzabu,2017-12-08 17:26:36

>8.) She supported Buddhism in Silla. This may not seem huge, but I cannot stress enough how central this was in the formation of Silla's culture, government, and the modern Korean culture and identity.

She did build a lot of temples, and her critics say that she built too many. In fact, many say that she should have religious bonuses!

>9.) Almost every account of her being a terrible person or ruler comes from the Joseon dynasty over 700 years after. Keep in mind the Joseon Dynasty adopted a hard-line Confucian stance on government and the role of women. Specifically one that codified that women were not fit to rule or govern. A lot of the negative accounts as a result are riddled with 15th and 16th century Joseon sexism that specifically exacerbated or dramatized her shortcomings. How do we know this is true? For one because Silla, Tang, and even Baekje and Goguryeo accounts recall her differently. Furthermore because the later Goryeo dynasty (who had no female rulers and barred them from succession) never had an official state account of her being a terrible person. This is coming from the dynasty that would overthrow the Silla.

Absolutely wrong. The histories were written less than 500 years after her death in 1145 - during the Goryeo period. This is prior to the introduction of Neo-Confucianism which sealed the fate of women during the Joseon dynasty. (centuries later) It's obvious that you are not a ""historian"" and I wonder if you are even Korean given that you don't know the basic dates and ages of Korea.

> 10.) Economically the Silla thrived in her period. She did have a temporary hiccup when she lost control over a Tang-Silla trade route as mentioned above, but it was later recovered. BUT she built a lot of roads throughout Silla. It helped increase internal trade and movement of goods. Furthermore her alliance with the Tang isolated Baekje and Goguryeo from the Tang court. This gave Silla a monopoly on Tang Chinese trade to the peninsula and cut off Goguryeo and Baekje's largest and geographically most significant trade routes apart from Wa Japan. It made Silla extremely wealthy.

Sources? Actually, these trade routes that you speak of in vague terms were set up by her predecessors for hundreds of years. Specifically by Beopheung, Jinheung, and her father due to their defeat of Gaya and Baekje as well as adoption and expansion of Buddhism. Her alliance with Tang did cut off trade for the other two kingdoms but I don't see anything about her becoming wealthy from it. Prior to this alliance, Seong had established international trade that seems to flourish up until Baekje had many internal issues during Seondeok's reign. But Seondeok is not directly responsible for those issues. [Also, Baekje and Goguryeo's alliance actually defeated Silla during Seondeok's reign and effectively blocked off the trade, which may be responsible for the later rebellion.](https://www.ancient.eu/Queen_Seondeok/)

Just copy pasting links to ""scholarly articles"" with quite strong slants proves nothing about your points.

In actuality the history that the myths of Seondeok are based on is quite obtuse or fantastical - depending on whether or not you're referring to the Samguk Sagi or Samguk Yusa. You'll get single lines mentioning things like the conquest of Silla castles by the Goguryeo-Baekje alliance. It is a combination of these obtuse references with later discoveries (including archaelogical ones) that allow real histories to come up with viewpoints. Korean viewpoints such as the ones in the Youtube videos are based on many articles written far past the prime of Neo-Confucianism.

Queen Seondeok put Silla's scientific advances at the forefront of the world. She constructed the first observatory in East Asia and the first dedicated scientific complex around it. Her observatory was copied by the Japanese Wa Observatory in 675 AD and Duke Zhou of China in 723 AD.

[You neglected to read the citation that wikipedia is referring to which states that her famous tower imitated one already created in Baekje.](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=bbmOuw2Rh14C&pg=PA65&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) The one that she had built is famous because it still stands. The Japanese copied the one in Baekje and built it in Asuka (by modern day Nara). I've been there.

For 4 I'm not going to challenge your record of her losses. However, maybe you should challenge the record yourself! Are the accounts of these battles legendary or not?

For 5 - refer to the achievements of her predecessors such as those of her father above. Was she really responsible for the centralization of government? Or did she simply help to continue something that was already started? I would argue that [Jinheung] (http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jinheung_of_Silla) is responsible for expansion and centralization of Silla power.

If you look to the sources you can see that part of the reasons for Bidam's revolt (aside from the legendary saying about a star falling which seemed to be an omen for the fall of a female ruler) were due to her spending on temples, military failures, alliance with China, etc., [Again this too is conjecture.](http://db.history.go.kr/item/level.do?sort=levelId&dir=ASC&start=1&limit=20&page=1&pre_page=1&setId=-1&prevPage=0&prevLimit=&itemId=sg&types=r&synonym=off&chinessChar=on&brokerPagingInfo=&levelId=sg_009r&position=-1) And please, don't use the drama as a historical reference. Because Seondeok was around 60 when Bidam led the revolt, Bidam had been in power for months and only one source claims that the revolt only lasted 10 days, and Seondeok dies either months after the revolt or during the revolt depending on my sources.

I see almost nothing wrong with Seondeok as a historical figure/ruler choice for Korea. My only complaint is with her looks. I have done a lot of research over the past couple of days and it has brought to light the fact that Koreans did NOT look very different 1400 years ago. They were indistinguishable from modern Koreans. I am happy you collected all this historical data together and presented it to us though. I am very interested in Korean history and I have been enjoying a lot of the debates going back and forth about her accomplishments as I learn more and more about Korea.

Edit:
I am not going to spam my opinion on the matter here because here is not the place for that, but if you want to read in more detail about how Seondeok should look and how Koreans did look; I detailed everything in this post

Seondeok is not a Horrible Choice: A Korean's Perspective,1692,2017-12-07 20:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/7i9jsx/seondeok_is_not_a_horrible_choice_a_koreans/,civ,"I have already posted in other threads. Most of the information about Seondeok is in the Samguk Sagi, foreign sources, and Samguk Yusa. Most of these records are written centuries later. Therefore many scholars outside of Korea and some more liberal ones inside of Korea are claiming about *theories* that the original histories are sexist and dismissive of Seondeok. And many people also get their ideas of Seondeok by a *fictional* drama designed mainly for Korean women who are the main audience.

Also note that some of these histories are somewhat pro-Silla and pro-China, so the accounts are heavily criticized by people who politically support regions that were once Baekje, Koguryeo, and Gaya. Interestingly many people in the regions that were once Silla criticize Baekje for being too pro-Japanese!

Much of the theories are related to how Confucianism is sexist in nature. However I would argue that society became incredibly against women holding any power only when Neo-Confucianism took hold. This did not happen until after the histories were written in Korea.

I think that these revisionist and neoliberal sources (such as the fictional drama) give people the wrong idea about Seondeok. To be honest she was a mediocre ruler who failed militarily as OP said. She also may have caused famine due to her focus on works such as the tower.

However, OP, are you living in Korea? What region are you from? In some areas in Korea she is less popular than others. This is partially responsible for vitriolic hate that we see. I think it is too late to ask Firaxis to change the ruler. A more positive approach would be to ask for an alternate ruler in a future expansion given that this system exists.

Many men in Korea also detest the over-a-century-old emasculation of Korea by foreign powers like Japan, the USA, Soviets, and recently (PRC) China. Korea was after all, a colony or vassal of other countries. The US supported Korean dictators. Prior to the 80s Korea was known in the US for cheap goods, prostitutes, war brides, and children to adopt. Other countries in a similar situation might be Ukraine, Poland, the Phillipines, Cambodia, and Holland.  Can you imagine Japan being given a female ruler, for example? Germany? Or the US? Some other countries avoid this issue somehow. Korean men are trained by the media to hope for strong male heroes in TV and cinema. And who can blame them, given how they are treated by foreign media and politicians?

Lastly OP, I do not know anyone in Korea who I have ever met aside from immigrants who look like this portrayal of Seondeok. This is the major problem that we have with the leader. I don't like that some call her ""pig"" or ""frog."" However she does not look ethnically like anyone that I know who is Korean. I am waiting for Firaxis to announce or display a change to her appearance as the months lead up to the expansion.",XavierAzabu,2017-12-08 09:38:29
Seondeok is not a Horrible Choice: A Korean's Perspective,1692,2017-12-07 20:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/7i9jsx/seondeok_is_not_a_horrible_choice_a_koreans/,civ,"So as I outlined in my many posts, I don't think that what you are claiming about Seondeok is true. **However, it is true that there may be a Neo-Confucian bias in some later histories and commentaries written about her (past hundreds of years). I have little knowledge or access to these and they are basically ignored in favor of more ancient texts.** But those supposed histories are not cited here at all. Instead OP refers to the Samguk Sugi and Samguk Yusa, which were not Neo-Confucian histories. (The mark is missed by hundreds of years) and therefore we have a vague anti-Confucianism at play with no proof.

So this defense of traditionalism may be the reason for the attacks against Seondeok. However your well-upvoted reddit post fails to defend Seondeok in a different way. Traditional Korean and Japanese shamanism (pre-State Shinto in Japan) as well as the original Confucian thought did not specifically relegate women to subordinate roles in the way that Neo-Confucianism (and to a lesser extent most schools of Buddhism) did. The rediscovery of old traditions and the strength of women in power relationships in the old days could be the greatest argument for leaders like Seondeok of Korea or Himiko of Japan.

I am not arguing she is the best choice possible, just that people are making a mountain out of a molehill with their issues with her 

Sure. I don't think that she's the worst pick possible either.

> 2.) I am Korean and speaking from the perspective of a Korean and a person who majored in Korean history 

This is the internet and you could be anyone. So could I.

> 3.) All the criticisms about her not looking ""Korean"" may be valid in so far as she does not look like our modern idea of what a Korean looks like. Keeping in mind Koreans do in fact have a wide range of looks even in modern day and no doubt could have looked significantly different back then it is not impossible for her to resemble what she does now compared to her pic.

It's pretty hard to argue that she looks like any Korean today aside from an immigrant. Not that immigrants look wrong or anything.

> 5.) I get that people are upset at Fraxis using her as a token example to advance social justice without taking into consideration her merits as a ruler may turn people off. If anyone did any AND I MEAN LIKE WIKIPEDIA LEVEL research on her they would know that Fraxis chose a relatively successful ruler who is important to the mission of advancing a more diverse video game.

Wikipedia is not the ideal choice for research. And Koreans in general are not all on the same page as Americans or Europeans who advocate so-called ""Social Justice"" which is more often globalist and Neo-Marxist thinking.

>Now as to why Queen Seonseok is not as bad of a leader to have been chosen:
>1.) Her rule was considered to be a renaissance for the Silla dynasty. The arts and literary prowess of Silla was considered to be far underdeveloped compared to its neighbors. Arguably it was during her reign that a united cultural identity of Silla arts and literary traditions really began to take root beyond its oral and musical traditions. It was also during her time that vast public works projects entrenched Silla architecture and gave it the foundation for later success using her established public works, buildings, and arts. Her buildings were so well known that they were known to have influenced Wa Japan's wooden architectural style (along with Baekje), so much so the best example of Korean Three Kingdoms architecture is still found in Japan.

Cite something, anything to prove this nonsense. Queen Seondeok did not have anything to do with any architectural styles that took root in Japan unless you are taking many liberties with ""influence."" Actually, it was BAEKJE that contributed to Korean influence in Japan during this period. Many artisans and even royalty from Baekje escaped to Japan **after** Seondeok died around the period of Korean unification. If anything she would have had less influence because the Japanese were allied with Baekje and Goguryeo. [Some written evidence here.](http://nihonshoki.wikidot.com/scroll-27-tenji)

Also, the connections that the Japanese have with Baekje and probably Gaya go far back. There are more records dealing with their connections to Baekje. One of the most famous connections is that between the Japanese imperial line and King Muryeong. [That lineage is here](http://www.myj7000.jp-biz.net/clan/03/03013.htm#003) Japanese sorry. So Buddhism, Korean/Chinese technologies and architecture came in through a period of hundreds of years and did not depend on anything. It's like saying that Ronald Reagan was responsible for Japanese architecture past the 80s.

>2.) She did by far the most to diplomatically develop Silla. Before Seondeok the diplomatic core of Silla was weak and underused. It had weaker relations with all of its neighbors and had no strong singular foreign ally that was able to support it against Goguryeo and a increasingly aggressive Baekje. Seondeok was the first of the Silla rulers to secure a Tang alliance. What is more impressive is she did this without giving into their conditions. Originally the Tang demanded a large portion of the Korean peninsula to be ceded in the event of a war to the Tang. Queen Seondeok not only rejected this outright, but she still managed to get the Tang to sign an formal military alliance without any of their conditions being included. After Queen Seondeok's death the Tang's alliance was instrumental (cannot stress this enough) in helping the Silla Dynasty unite the Korean peninsula, something that would not have had previously happened without the political maneuvering of Queen Seondeok who switched the Tang from favoring Baekje to Silla.

I cannot quote the Samguk Sagi directly but I will just use [this page](https://www.ancient.eu/Queen_Seondeok/) which is somewhat in line with the history. Seondeok herself is not principally responsible for the Silla-Tang connections. She is rather responsible for solidifying a failed military alliance. Now the solidification of the alliance may be loved by admirers of Seondeok but she is reviled by some Koreans for ""selling out"" Korea to Tang China. I would argue instead that her reliance of the two Kims including [Kim Yushin](https://www.ancient.eu/Kim_Yushin/) led to the victories of Silla. Because of this reliance on the Chinese, more Koreans might admire Taejo of Joseon's achievements more.

However she was simply using what was already in place. [Her father Jinpyeong was the one who really started the successful alliance, trade, religious exchange, and educational exchange with the Tang.] (http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jinpyeong_of_Silla)

Regardless of whether you believe either was or was not a good ruler, Wu Zetian's dramatic rise from concubine to Emperor had become the stuff of legends within the century of her death. Poets and playwrights had written epics on the subject by the end of the Tang dynasty 200 years later.

By contrast, Seondeok wasn't even mentioned in a major historical work for 500 years after her death. While there is some reason to believe actions taken during her reign were part of a chain of events leading to the unification of Korea, she never played a central part in that process.

The developers have stated that their goal is not to get the best rulers, but to get ""big personalities"". We could argue all day about whether Seondeok was a good queen or not - and the fact is there just isn't enough historical writing about her to get a clear answer.

But that's the problem right there. Whether she was a good or bad queen, Seondeok was never a big personality. By contrast, even the detractors of Wu Zetian would not question that she is a big personality. Whether she plays the hero or the villain, Wu Zetian always has a leading role in histories of that period.",deezee72,2017-12-08 06:27:20

For example, he was known for his use of cavalry, so if they decided to give Japan a mounted unique instead of samurai as usual, he'd make a fine pick for the leader to justify that choice. Given that they seem okay with the idea of multiple leaders representing one culture, I'd actually like to see more options like this in the future.

Most of the leader choices seem to be based on recognition more than anything else, so they're often either the founders/firsts or the lasts before a major decline. The former category is rarely going to encompass our modern idea of a country's territory, and basing leadership qualifications off that idea really only looks at the military success of a leader or their predecessors instead of the scientific, cultural, diplomatic, economic, or...infrastructural? (I can't think of the right word here) successes, all of which are also vitally important in this game. With the decision to make Korea a science-focused culture, who better to pick than a leader associated with the first observatory, an emphasis on arts/literature, and a reputation for critical thinking?

EDIT: Since you seem so opposed to Shingen, I'm curious how you feel about Pericles and Gorgo for Greece, who only led city-states in a non-unified country? And Qin Shi Huang, as a dynastic founder, only ruled over a small portion of what is now China, which wouldn't approach its modern territorial boundaries until the Yuan nearly 1500 years later.",Originally_Sin,2017-12-08 13:55:21

Historians do have issues piecing together the full views of people like Seondeok because most histories are not her contemporary nor are they extensive in the Samguk Yusa or Sagi due to various reasons. Hence why study beyond these sources are necessary and indeed have happened which is where the inferences to her competency appear. 

As I have said before I have lived in the States. Korean viewpoints have been conservative neo-Confucian, but there is a large movement to correct those biases recently.

Also this isn't just a US thought war. This is a real issue among every country in the world where nationalists (both left and right like you) spew crap that globalism or viewpoints different from pseudo-orthodox sources amount to cultural genocide.

Silla controlled territories Taedong river south and Balhae Taedong river north. There is wide discussion among scholars recently whether this means that Silla truly did unify Korea or it is better to give this to Goryeo as it absorbed the southern third of Balhae.

3.) Silla had periods of alliance with Wa Japan. Like literally read wikipedia in English if need be and look up the history of each of the three Kingdoms. 
4.) https://books.google.com/books?id=bbmOuw2Rh14C&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false is a good English source to the cultural diffusion of Silla. Specifically things like Cheomsadae
5.) Would you like sources in Korean and Chinese? This is not asked sarcastically. It is legitimately hard to find English translations for most of these sources. Mainly because most English world Asian history scholars are Japan/China based. Not Korean. 
6.) Based on your standard of argumentation Korean influence on Wa Japan was only post fall of Baekje.

Also keep in mind that Baekje architecture shared very similar agents with Silla architecture.

His son Gwanghaegun was the de facto leader of Joseon while Seonjo was busy saving his own skin. But yeah it's a very interesting war.

3 countries involved: Korea, Japan, China (and even the Jurchens for a brief moment)

Basically a war that pitted a country that experienced decades of nonstop war and emphasized a warrior class (Japan) versus a country that experienced about 200 years of peace and emphasized a scholar-gentleman class (Korea).

One side had the advantage in land warfare, the other side had the advantage in naval warfare.

Guerilla warfare by the Righteous Army. Even warrior monks getting involved.

Tons of technology involved. Japan had some of the best matchlocks at the time. China brought in their big cannons. Korea had crazy shit like the Hwacha, Turtle Ships, time bombs, and reconnaissance kite-gliders.

I, as an average American, have never heard of Sejong aside from Civ games, and were I younger then the only leader for historical/feudal Korea I would be aware of would be Seondeok. Blame the US education system if you'd like, but I don't think its fair to claim that she, as a historical leader a small nation, should have to be anywhere near as notable as Wu Zeitan. I feel like its disingenuous to imply that the level of fame for any feudal Korean leader is especially high. Clearly she had her own (fictionalized as it is) TV show that shows that she's in the national conversation.


While I'm sure some would pillory me for it, I would argue that part of what makes her distinct and interesting is that she is a woman, which was rare at the time. I find that relatively noteworthy. It's like talking about President Obama. Part of what he will always be known for, for better or worse, is that he was the first black president. There's no way to separate that from his legacy, and it would seem silly to me to pretend that it isn't notable. Likewise, she has well documented successes, as noted in the OP, and she also happened to be a woman. Personally, I don't find her less interesting than Sejong and honestly wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't blown up with comments literally blaming the decision entirely on ""the SJW liberal agenda!""",[deleted],2017-12-08 15:34:57

And given Japanese written sources, Baekje and Japanese royalty had very strong connections. Right before the wars with Seondeok Baekje had extensive religious contact with Japan.

Assuming that because the Ayyubid dynasty's territory extended into the borders of modern-day nations which today identify as Arab, it must have been an Arab empire, is a mistake. 'Arab' culture meant nothing at the time, the idea of an Arabic cultural sphere is literally absolutely meaningless in this context. 
 
What would Arab culture even mean at the time? 

It can't be said that Saladin ruled over the whole or even most of the 'Arab' world in any linguistic sense; first, though Arabic was the lingua franca and the language of the scholarly class, the vast majority of people continued to communicate at first exclusively, and later simultaneously, in their native tongue. If simply having Arabic as the lingua franca makes it an Arab Empire, then we should just put all of medieval Europe together as one civilization lead by the 'Latin' empire. Second, Arabic was a lingua franca well beyond Ayyubid domains too (from the Maghreb and Spain to Yemen to Uzbekistan to northern India), so if that is the unifying category then he definitely did not control the 'Arab' world. 

Nor can it be said that he ruled over an 'Arab' empire in any social or ethnic sense - the people did not identify themselves with a shared Arab race or people or heritage. The term 'Arab' was used exclusively to refer to what we would call the Bedouins - the semi-nomadic tribes of the Syrian desert and the Arabian penninsula. Only in the 20th century did the regions of Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Libya, etc. begin calling themselves Arabs, with the dawn of pan-Arabism. The vast majority of people living within Abbasid domains identified as Syriac, Armenian, Kurdish, Coptic, Greek, Berber, etc. (or some other constellation of Turkic/Semitic/Persian identities.) The idea of 'Arab' as a common identity would be foreign to anyone in the 12th century. 

It can't even be said that the area partook in a common **Arab literary or aesthetic culture. Yes, they had broad similarities, but to the extent that that is true those similarities would far more accurately be described as a complex blend of Turkic, Persian, and Arab elements. Besides, as was the case for language, this culture spread well beyond Ayyubid domains.

So you'd have to be pretty arbitrarily defining the limits of the 'Arabic cultural sphere' to suggest that Saladin ruled over most of it. If you define the Arab cultural sphere so broadly as to include the Levant (based on such features as common language, religion, or aesthetics), then you would have to concede that Saladin has excluded a great deal of this sphere, since the Maghreb, Persia, and Anatolia also had these features. If you constrain your definition to the exclusion of those areas, then none of Saladins domains can reasonably be called Arab, they are more appropriately Syriac, Turkic, etc.

These pre-unification leaders are a big part of Japanese history and culture, and Shingen in particular is one of the big ones that are prominently featured in samurai media. 

Besides, why does it matter that Shingen was never offered the title of Shogun? History is an N of 1 - the whole point of civ is that we can guide things differently, why should we restrict ourselves to only historically prominent civs and leaders, rather than take the opportunity to present something different and interesting? To go back to the title argument of the thread, I had no idea who Seondeok was before this announcement, and now i've gained a lot of knowledge about her, and I think that's fantastic. 

Civ doesn't need to follow history - the fact you can start the game as America proves that, and this is why i'm in favour of using lesser known civs and lesser known leaders. Just because they didn't rise to prominence in real N=1 History, doesn't mean they don't have a lot to offer. ",NeuroCavalry,2017-12-08 23:07:20

He was religious and involved in religious wars, but he was not the fanatic he is sometimes portrayed as. He was intelligent and a patron of art, science and mathematics.

""Wa"" is a name for Japan used in Korean, Chinese, and some Japanese sources to refer to Yamato Japan. Specifically in Korean it is Wae. Earliest evidence of this is found on the Gwanggaeto Stele. This is also where the Korean ""Waegu"" or Japanese Pirates came from. In Korean it is spelled ""ÏôÄ"". Also Gaya had significant cultural links with Japan, correct. No major scholar outside of Japan though goes as far as to suggest that it was subordinate to Japan or that it was a proto-Japanese state in terms of ethnic or cultural make up. 

2.) Not sure how I can prove to you I am Korean. Sorry? Then again according to you the mixing of the races is near cultural genocide so I guess as someone who is half Korean wouldn't be Korean but rather an abomination? :D should have been more clear I was born in Korea, lived there, first language, and I am half something else. :D :D :D 

3.) Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa have actually been translated into the Korean script since 1448. It is widely available. Also Koreans have to learn Hanja in school due to the fact we still use Hanja in certain parts of Korean, most widely in counting sometimes. So yes I do know how to read classical Korean written in Chinese script just as I am sure you know how to read classical Japanese in Chinese script. 

4.) Historians make arguments based on evidence which is what I have done. I never said Seondeok was great. Maybe your English needs work. I only said that the idea that she was a horrific despot who doesn't know how to rule is false and a product of sexism evident in Korean and many other histories given the surrounding historiography. 

5.) I actually did link scholarly articles in response unlike your wiki-esque articles. unfortunately half of them require subscriptions, but you can read the abstract in them. The others are shorter niche subjects that relate. 

6.) Considering your history with anti-globalist and what seems to be right wing Japanese nationalistic tendencies with offensive victim complex arguments I am not sure what a continued conversation with you will actually do beyond just make us both more frustrated with the other. 

7.) All of your arguments seem to point out I underplay Baekje rather than credit it. Ok so again not arguing Baekje wasn't more formative to Japan than Silla was, only that it was indeed an important cultural link as well. This is just a passing ship argument.

Historically,  he did a lot of good foe the Empire. He centralized authority away from the vaneer of Senatorial authority of the AugustuIan Princeps and transferred to himself,  Domitian.  He was an authoritarian in every sense.  Think of an ancient Putin who was very open about his display of power. 

A major note lost to the layman,  is that he was absolutely loved by the populace.  He brought them food and games a plenty,  and that was what those masses want.  He had the absolute loyalty of the army.  This come from his kinsman ship with Vespatian and Trahan as well as the 33% pay increase.  Really the only people who did not like Domitian are the ones he did not just sideline from power,  but ruthlessly beat and demean. 

The reason Domitian gets a bad rap is the same reason Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge or Julian the Apostate are painted in very certain lights : The historians liked those sources.  Maxentius was the victim of Christendom monks and Julian was beloved by the soldier historian who served under him.  For Domitian,  the history is written by the senators who eventually killed him.  We love Titus so much,  except the Jews, because of the praise and lavish awe stalked to him by the historians of the day.  I absolutely love Domitian,  he's one of those rulers that Rome needed in its darkest hour.  His death,  however,  sparked a civil war.

His title being Arabic is irrelevant. Most Muslim rulers, from any part of the world, had a title in Arabic, given that it is the liturgical language of Islam. 

And to say that he commanded the 'Arabic' armies (btw, civlopedia, Arabic is a language, Arab is the people) is completely disingenuous and inaccurate.

""Wa"" is a name for Japan used in Korean, Chinese, and some Japanese sources to refer to Yamato Japan. Specifically in Korean it is Wae. Earliest evidence of this is found on the Gwanggaeto Stele. This is also where the Korean ""Waegu"" or Japanese Pirates came from. In Korean it is spelled ""ÏôÄ"". Also Gaya had significant cultural links with Japan, correct. No major scholar outside of Japan though goes as far as to suggest that it was subordinate to Japan or that it was a proto-Japanese state in terms of ethnic or cultural make up.

Of course I know Âíå but why are you simply not calling it Japan? It was the state that eventually became the Japan of today after many changes. And yes I know about the dwarf kanji for ""wa"" that appears in Chinese sources.

>2.) Not sure how I can prove to you I am Korean. Sorry? Then again according to you the mixing of the races is near cultural genocide so I guess as someone who is half Korean wouldn't be Korean but rather an abomination? :D should have been more clear I was born in Korea, lived there, first language, and I am half something else. :D :D :D

How do you now that I'm not half either? And you're making really poor assumptions about Japanese. Many Japanese like half and think that they are quite attractive. In fact, I have a friend who is part Korean part Japanese but has a Korean name and used to suffer for it here. I am sympathetic to this.

> 3.) Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa have actually been translated into the Korean script since 1448. It is widely available. Also Koreans have to learn Hanja in school due to the fact we still use Hanja in certain parts of Korean, most widely in counting sometimes. So yes I do know how to read classical Korean written in Chinese script just as I am sure you know how to read classical Japanese in Chinese script.

Then why not talk about the history or link to the database like I did?

>4.) Historians make arguments based on evidence which is what I have done. I never said Seondeok was great. Maybe your English needs work. I only said that the idea that she was a horrific despot who doesn't know how to rule is false and a product of sexism evident in Korean and many other histories given the surrounding historiography.

What evidence? Your links only go to theory. The actual history is very obtuse.

This is theory and this is very western which I think is leading a few people to just assume that you are some random Koreaboo. 

>5.) I actually did link scholarly articles in response unlike your wiki-esque articles. unfortunately half of them require subscriptions, but you can read the abstract in them. The others are shorter niche subjects that relate.

It seems like a few of the articles that you're linking to were linked by Wikipedia or other encyclopedia pages. But regardless some function as a light English narrative at a high school level to flesh out the passages in the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa. **Some of these narratives mention mythological passages or anecdotes, which aren't facts.** I can link specific passages in Korean. But for instance, the story of the peonies. Compare this to a robust history of Silla. If you check your facts, you'd know why the two Kims were ended up in the position that they did, and it wasn't because Seondeok chose them due to her brilliance.

One of the journals that you link to does seem to be a source for another page about some of the structures that she constructed. But many of the others have something to do with the drama and revisionist history / women's studies / anti-confucianism. It's fine but most historians consider those to be light reads. That proves nothing about her record. When you made your claims what got me excited is that maybe you'd read some solid history that I hadn't. Which you didn't because it doesn't exist, except in post-modern conjecture because interest in Seondeok was boosted by the drama.

> 6.) Considering your history with anti-globalist and what seems to be right wing Japanese nationalistic tendencies with offensive victim complex arguments I am not sure what a continued conversation with you will actually do beyond just make us both more frustrated with the other.

Oh this is great. I am not a right-wing Japanese. However, I don't like it when we get an international student/exchange student/scholar/politician from abroad who tries to tell us what Japan should do or should have done. If you are actually Korean, shouldn't you actually sympathize?

>7.) All of your arguments seem to point out I underplay Baekje rather than credit it. Ok so again not arguing Baekje wasn't more formative to Japan than Silla was, only that it was indeed an important cultural link as well. This is just a passing ship argument.

The ties between Baekje, Gaya, Silla, Goguryeo, and the various dynasties of China and their relationships with proto-Japan and early Japan are still somewhat theoretical. I have been to sites in Kyushu, Chugoku, and Kansai and seen very strong evidence of ties to Korea. I know the family relationships between Baekje and Japan and have read through some Japanese and English works including the originals on old Japanese histories similar to the Korean Samguk Sagi. While these relationships are sometimes theoretical, it's fairly obvious that many people from Baekje in particular with certain skills came to Japan over the centuries - and moreso than from Silla or Goguryeo. The court ties were strong and some clans like the Soga profited tremendously from that relationship. Eventually there are accounts of escapees coming from Gaya and Baekje (which have different names in Japanese). 

And as for your claim that I am a nationalist - nations form and take different shapes throughout the ages. Certainly the Japan as it is today would not be without the influence of the nation-state system from England and France. Similarly Korea is a construct and that very fact is what creates tension regarding the different regions of Korea such as the rivalry between west and east. The spectre of Silla still remains.",XavierAzabu,2017-12-08 20:50:16

I made that comment while out drinking and it came out as far more patronizing and disrespectful than I intended.

But I guess the real point I was trying to make is that in China, you study poetry in school as part of the standard curriculum. So it is no really a niche field of study at all - basically anyone who has been educated in the Chinese school system will have learned about Wu Zetian.

By contrast, Seondeok was extremely obscure among Koreans until she got her own TV show. While she is much better known now due to the popularity of the show, people's knowledge of her is also very superficial, since the show didn't really have clear historical sources to go off and just fictionalized most of her personality. By contrast, Sejong is also someone that basically any well-educated Korean person will have learned about in school.

You're right to say that Seondeok's name recognition is not really that low. But I think there's a difference between someone who people know from a TV show which is more a work of fiction than of history, and someone who is presented to every schoolchild in the country as someone who they will need to know in order to understand their own history and culture.

The best comparison I can come up with is that it's like Fireaxis had realized that The King's Speech was a super successful movie, and decided to make King George VI the leader of England instead of Elizabeth or Victoria. It's not like people don't know who he is (due to the movie), but it would leave a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths.",deezee72,2017-12-09 02:28:00

My metric here is Arabic language and culture rather than Arab ethnicity. Of course the inhabitants of the empire were diverse with Copts, Kurds, Turks, Jews, Armenians, etc. all preserving their languages and customs especially in communities outside the cities, with Arabic serving as a *lingua franca* and language of government.

Perhaps it was a mistake on my part to call them ""Arab lands"". My intent was to apply Civilization's very loose definition of ""Arabia"", which apparently includes all territories held by an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East between 632-1258. The games are full of such retroactive labeling, ""Germany"" being another example. Of course the Ayyubids themselves probably never called themselves an ""Arab"" empire, rather simply a ""Muslim"" empire as nationalism as we know it today didn't exist. Civ 3 and Civ 5 sort of got away with this by having Abu Bakr and Harun al-Rashid as Arabia's leaders and Mecca as the capital, but Saladin and the Ayyubid empire fit the bill a little less neatly.

I agree with you that calling Saladin's armies ""Arabic"", whether intended literally or not, is a gross oversimplification. The Ayyubid armies consisted largely of Turks, and Saladin is even said to have spoken to his generals in Turkish.

Asian style cushions, bb/cc creams, multi-step routines, etc. have been popular with beauty bloggers, influencers, and western retailers for some time. Buzzfeed even did articles and videos about this. And a lot of those ""western"" companies you are referring to as trying to capitalize on a trend are ones which make products catering specifically to an asian audience as well.

Its really sad this sort of discussion keeps coming up every couple of months. I remember a friend of mine writing a post up here back during 2.2-ish I think, about the state of rewards particularly how dungeons were dead on arrival. And in the years since then not much has changed.

For me though I think the biggest core issue is Eureka just isn't fun. And I grinded mobs for years in XI, but both the class design and combat design was compelling to make it enjoyable and mask the grind. On top of that the slower pace of combat made it easier to do something else, or more importantly hold a conversation with people while you were grinding. There's none of that here. 

The next big issues is, 1) this was delayed and is insulting shallow. Its just grind some mobs and occasionally an NM pops up. No quests, no leves, nothing. Its the epitome of shallow design. Outside the map itself and the elemental system nothing is new. It's unbelievable it took them this long to put something so shallow out. And 2) they keep taking dungeons away and say its to provide new content, but we wind up with this. Which just leaves me wondering if the devs are just that understaffed despite how much money this game makes the company. Or is the dev team just that incompetent that they can't making any sort of compelling content? I really don't care which it is, the question I have is what will they do to fix things and finally breath life into the game?

And, for me, what makes this the most frustrating is having been an avid XI player for years. And each expansion added new systems to the game. Especially the after ToAU. Not all the content was a hit, but I can't recall anything flopping near as hard as Eureka/Diadem. It's frustrating to see the same company that made expansions that brought Beseiged, Assault, Nyzul Isle, Einherjar, Salvage, and Campaign, just to name some things, can't even make an airship exploration system that features airships or exploration. Its just baffling to me to see such a disconnect where one team creatively pushes the limits of what they can do with a near 2 decade old engine, while the other struggles to even make fighting open world mobs compelling and interesting.",Bahamut2000x,2018-03-14 04:11:11

Every MMO has grindy elements to it but trash mobs is not something XIV excels at as I find XIV more of a technical MMO than a button masher.

What made ARR something special is something you touched on; *it took risks*. Though, in many way, FFXIV did feel pretty similar to other MMOs (WoW in particular), it was a huge deviation from 1.0 and had its own personality to distinguish it from the crowd. It also had something a lot of other games on the market: the *promise* of something better.

The promise continued into the 2.X patches. Innovations were added and the storytelling went through major changes to evolve into what players would fall in love with through 3.0. More promises came in 3.0 and its following patch cycle. Things were getting better, and more importantly, there was a sense that it was going to get *even better* in the future.

FFXIV stumbled with 4.0. It's certainly not a *bad* expansion, but it is missing the *promise* of something better on the horizon. ARR and HW had a clear path moving forward for its story and gameplay. SB has us feeling uncertain about what's around the corner. We're no longer maching towards Ishgard or the end of the Dragonsong War. We're just kind of reacting to whatever is going on. Omega is sort of there throwing references at us. Eureka was not only a secret, but a disappointing one for most if not all players.

FFXIV is, more than anything, missing direction. It's gotten complacent. It's gotten *safe*. Where is the sense of danger, both from game systems and storytelling, that we got from the ARR relaunch? Where's the sense of coming into one's own while still pushing one's boundaries that we got in HW? SB feels more like a victory lap. Almost self congratulatory. Not designed for *me*, the player.

We need things to be shaken up again. Throw away the chisel and just use the hammer on the classes and make something *risky*. Subvert the dungeon and the raid as content. Get players doing something they didn't expect to do - and make it feel meaningful.

I could go into specifics about what went wrong here and there, and what went right. I talk game design all day. It's my job. But what I see wrong with FFXIV right now is pretty simple. The formula is stale. It needs to be changed. It needs a little controversy. A little courage. It needs to take these expectations it's built up over the last 4 years and absolutely crush them just as it did when it hurled a meteor at the world.

Right now we are grinding with no real visible progression besides 10% extra damage every now and then...  

They could have had a variable aggro system, small treasure hunting opportunities, small puzzles, but the biggest thing I think they missed out on is the gear itself. I get they want to make gear as simple as possible, but for Eureka only, they could have made some unique materia to attach to your AF gear. Something like having a wind resistance materia and putting more than one levels up the wind resist, and at 4 or 5 materia it gives you some unique stat (chance to double attack? increases gauge generation?). Maybe a set of materia that has detrimental affects for a strong ability. You can also spread the materia out so you explore all of Anemos, maybe it drops from a coffer that appears at night, maybe you have to do a small jump puzzle, or you have to solo chain 30 of a certain mob to spawn a player specific nm.

You're correct in that FFXIV has been a gear treadmill since day one. This, however, is not exactly anything new to the genre. This is what people play them for, I feel. You get gear, you fight the big bad, you get better gear, you fight the next big bad. In this respects I think FFXIV does it the best of any MMO on the market. The raiding in this game is tight, focused, and approachable. Fights are engaging, challenging, but not unreasonable and the rewards are good. They're satisfying, and the sets all have a unique look to them for a glamour fiend like myself. By releasing gear that is relevant for longer you interrupt this cycle that's kept people interested in the end game thus far.

That being said...

You are absolutely correct in that everything that's not raiding is an rng check box grind. I'm genuinely baffled that Eureka is what it is because it highlights a fundamental lack of understanding in how to do content that isn't focused around gear. This also goes for the change of focus for Relic. In ARR I thought it was super cool that you had to down tough trials and do end game to earn the things to get your relic + upgrade... But then it turned into a way to keep content churn going and it's been dead to me since. I've legit never had a relevant relic outside of Zenith... And I was damn proud of my Zenith lol.

So far, in terms of long term alternative content, we've had like what... Maps, Diadem, PoTD, and PvP right? PvP is probably never going to be fun or engaging in this game with the current approach and basically making a completely different game for the sake of pvp being fun is unrealistic. (Due to the combat system right now not really being good for pvp no matter what they do to it).

Diadem was too much rng, too much grinding, and not enough reward. SO that just leaves us with the only successful things: Maps and PoTD.

PoTD, imo, is fun past 100 because that's where the content shines. It's difficult, it's intense, and you really have to play smart to get deeper. I don't do it to see what I get, I do it to see if I can. 1-100 is just a generic way to power classes and that's fine, really, but it's something that's not related to gear that doesn't give gear either that's still being used.

Then there's maps. Pure rng, pure thrill. The canals are great, the rewards add up but they're also nothing useful. It's all glamour, extra stuff, things to grind and work for in a very different way. It's a want, extra, so there's no real sense of disappointment when you don't win that glamour item but the feeling of satisfaction when you do is immense. These two things both are concepts they should continue with because they work and they're completely different from raiding, the game's main selling point.

How they have yet to try to smash these two things together is beyond me. The ilevels also make it obvious this stuff was meant for 4.1 not 4.25. I wouldn't have cared if the gear launched irrelevant to end game if it was fun to get. I want the dyable AF stuff. I want fancy weapons. But I sure as heck don't wanna not have fun doing it. Doing something kinda grindy can be satisfying if the reward is good... But satisfaction and fun are not synonymous. I'm satisfied when I vacuum my room and it looks nice again. I didn't have fun doing it. I think that's something they've mixed up.

Side note, on the topic of true player interactions being lacking: I genuinely think this is mainly a result of almost the entirety of content just being grinds. Never get more than a ""Hi"" and ""Thanks for party"" in experts. Barely even get a hi in potd. People queue up, turn their brains off, and push flashing buttons. Map parties tho? Hunts? In my experience much more social. Shit... I make more friends playing competitive first person shooters than I do in FF. Kinda telling, honestly. ",Mahorela5624,2018-03-14 17:06:31

You select your loadout to accomplish what you want. It's a puzzle with more than one solution depending on player preference - if you decide to fight a boss with talent A, B, C, it will influence your choice of equipment.

A wheel where you just choose the element that hurts the mob the most. Magicite points? Just place them in one direction (e.g. 12 o'clock; max damage) or two directions (e.g. 12:00 and 4:30; even damage and defense).

FFXIV has painted itself in a corner regarding innovation. If you look back at 2.0 patch cycle you can see that the team did try to elevate the end-game experience outside the constraints of linear dungeons and a unifyied currency but the community reaction was ranging from lukewarm to toxic in each attempt.

- The First relic quest involved no grind and was about beating unique challenges and primals using subpar equipment. A large part of the playerbase couldn't work through it. A river of tears run through the forums because of titan and many people simply quit from endgame progression because of it.


- Amdapoor keep was very tought if you didn't have at least the first primal weapon. Demon Wall had to be repeadly nerfed because people could farm their weekly tomes as they were getting their ass handled to them. Speed runs had to be reigned in because newbies were getting intimidated from running this content after being left behind by experienced players that bolted in and locked them out of the bosses.


- Pharus Sirius was the first new dungeon introduced and was hard as hell. Probably the hardest dungeon the game have ever seen. The first boss killed groups multiple times and people were kicked out of the dungeon because they couldn't kill Siren before the timer run out. The Devs had to nerf stuff because player cried and casuals were starting to dread an ever increasing difficulty climb as patches progressed


- Even though some people were complaining about not being able to kill titan hardmode the team introduced Extreme Primals and a weekly quest in which you had to kill all of them to get a decent weapon. It was fun, challenging and, as you can imagine, unsustainable due to how it alienated most of the casual players.


- The first coil when released didn't reward players with Ilevel beyond their relics and tomegear. It didn't need to because those who challenged it did it because they wanted to prove themselves. There was an entire storyline in there as a soft reward and to be able to claim to have ""experienced the full story"" put a fire under people's ass. The community couldn't handle it... People who couldn't or wouldn't do the coils wanted to see the story and those that actually run the stuff started to claim they felt more quantifiable rewards were needed.


- When hunts were introduced they were supposed to be integral to the end-game, they would live side by side with tomes and incentive people to explore the overworld... The community couldn't even be trusted to organize itself. An ocean of complains about pulling too early, taking too long to pull, not waiting enought people to join, taking too long for spawns, hunts being too uninteresting and dying to early... etc... etc...


- Leviathan introduced the first taste of grind to players. You had to work to get your mirrors and to have a enhanced version fo the primals weapon was a symbol of dedication or at least luck. People hated on it... 


- The first 24 man raid was released late. It messed the gear cycle and was easier then much of the content that was released before... ironically, people love it. The first overall positive reaction from the playerbase was toward an unintended ""catch up"" dungeon with toned down mechanics that sometimes involved doing nothing more then clicking on stuff ( king Behemoth pillars became iconic for all the wrong reasons). The gear was a mixed bag of useless and best in slot that served to push late comer to the coils a bit further. The only challenging thing in the whole proccess, the attunement quest, was deviled as a blight though. The community sent a very clear message that it wanted easy, brain dead stuff and didn't care too much about the rewards beyond their appeareance.


- The initial relic was accompanied by a very long disclosure and discussion telling that it was supposed to be a luxury item that wouldn't be Best In Slot and was to be a more of a life achievement then part of the progression. It was something that player that wanted to dedicate themselves to the game could get their teeth in so they could have a very exclusive skin to put over their other weapons. It was about status, dedication and putting the work in. The community did embrace the relic quest. It cried and cried about every step on the way, but it was pretty apparent how much of the active community put their hearts and souls into the proccess. Every time the relic got to be Best in Slot for any small period of time there was rage and drama, though. The feedback embracing the grind was clear as well as the message that it should not ever be necessary or important in any small way.


- By the end of the 2.0 Patch Cycle we got some serious main quest challenges. The story was reaching its climax and the Ascians became the central point... the community couldn't handle that, though. People raged gainst any sort of challenge in the main story. The last step of the campaign before heavensward was nerfed and nerfed and nearfed until the community itself was split between those disgusted by the ever lowering bar and those that couldn't and wouldn't ever learned to play the game. 


While some people may have some fond memories of 3.0 it was just a rehash of 2.0 with less confidence in the community ability to handle deviations in the core endgame content. Diadem and Palace of the Dead had to be quaranteened in their own bubble of irrelevance so allergic reactions from the community could be deflected by the ""optional content"" argument. If PotD was received as a nice addition, Diadem was a flaming failure both of the times... compounding on the aprehention the Developers seemed to nurture gainst their own playerbase.


StormBlood was the first time I actually quitted from the game. I truly lost hope that FFXIV would grow into a more fleshed out MMO than it already is. The current expansion does polish a lot of the system, animations and game elements that survived contact with the community, but those elements and their design principles put me outside the demography the game values. The current business plan for the game seems to be to provide a 2 year ""ride"" for new players in which they experience a full expansion of content development. Any period after this that they can retain a player through side activities is a nice bonus but the effort of the Dev team is to hook and polish the core content of that 2 year period in which newbies experience all that FFXIV has to offer for the first time. Unfortunatelly this is a very sustainable plan for a game that ains to last 5-7 years... and I fully believe that is the aim of Sqenix in this title. Even though Stormblood was uninspired and ""procedural"" for those that experienced the game since its rerelease, it was also a major finantial victory for the company... it sealed the deal on this business model.",kaworo0,2018-03-14 11:54:09

The reason why expansions forcibly change job rotations is because otherwise people would be bored of the playstyle being no different after 2 years. We have zero choice in how we play our jobs, and everything is constantly made into a grind because SE knows that the game just doesn't have the variety to support our interest in the long-term, so they carrot-and-stick us to try and trick us into wanting the same thing that's a little bit shinier this time. 

We're constantly time-gated and have to run the same thing over and over again because there is zero depth or variety that makes us WANT to come back.

The real problem is that the gameplay is terrible.. it‚Äôs the same repetitive thing and the chance of failure is minimal. Like, grinding in necromancers or fire salamanders in RO is funner than this cause you can easily wipe anytime so you gotta play careful... also the rewards feel unworthy of the effort whereas in RO those mobs can drop decent stuff

I honestly think the problem stems from them trying to make the whole eureka for casual players.. like they could‚Äôve made eureka full fleshed our so that mid-core and hardcore players can also enjoy it. So instead of making casual content called eureka in ffxiv, make casual, midcore and hardcore content within a game mode called eureka. Rn it feels too basic, like the level 1-30 in RO, normal grinding all the way with minimal learning curve or skill. Now it feels like you‚Äôre forcing yourself to go through the content for the relic, when really the content itself should be fun enough to do, and the relic just the icing.

While, yes, that's absolutely something that sets the game apart from others, the want to keep to a single job or two is part of reducing the grind. If they wanted everyone to have a bunch of jobs at 70, that would make the grind worse, not better. Part of trying to reduce the grind was putting systems in place to ease the ability to play what you want, when you want, but at the same time make it so someone who only levels one combat job can do any of the content someone who has levelled all of then can.

Look at the tomestone and weekly caps if you want to see what they're talking about. Most adults who work full time don't have hours upon hours to play everyday. So, if you focus for an hour each day, maybe two, you're capable of staying relevant. THAT is what they're aiming for. They want you to be able to play new content when it drops without a crazy high time investment in grinding out stuff unless you want to. And I think that's ok.

I'm, truly, truly glad that you have posted this, and i thank you for this, i'm not sure if the OP is going to be reading this since this is a popular post and is already flooded with comments, but i wanted to let you know this first.

I started playing this exactly 990 days prior to this one, i think that it was around the leviathan patch, the game totally consumed me, it was fun as hell, the classes were all unique and fun to play, it just hook me hard. FFXIV was the first MMRPG that could catch me for 990 days.

On the first 3 months of playing, i met people from a spanish FC in moogle, what would be my surprise, when i knew that the people which i were hanging out like doing dungeons, teaching me to play, helping me with Titan and discovering me what a Relic weapon is, are today, my best friends that LIVE IN THE SAME CITY, we are all 10m apart by walking, it was fucking awesome and im truly glad that i've met them in ffxiv.

It hurts me, it really hurts me now, the game that i keep playing until today, is at this state, where the friends that i talked about play no more because of the major reasons OP posted:

Dead content. -Lack of true player interactions. -Gear irrelevancy.

And this is basically because the game is boring for the peeps that were around since ARR, same system of dungeons, same feel of gear progressions, same.. and same.. and same... the list just goes on.
Its like the people dont see, that since ARR we got.. 24 man raids, Palace of the Dead and... Diadem/Eureka.... that's all, that's it, there isnt a new concept apart of these in 3 years, i'll repeat myself again;

There isnt a new concept apart of these in 3 years, not a single one, don't count me new classes, dont count me new classes skills, even savage tiers nor primals because surprise, we have a monthly fee for something, they NEED to refresh ATLEAST and as a MINIMUM the quantity of classes and skills here is like also the actual gameplay as the game keeps going, since it keeps going thanks to us, players who pay theirs monthly fee not only to being capable of play the game for 30 days, also for
receive quality and refreshing content and MAKE THAT 30 DAYS OF PLAY being FUN.

I don't care if there are people who enjoy the game in its actually state, if you are one of those its okay, its truly okay but please, dont negate what is obvious at this moment: Final Fantasy XIV have a huge problem going right now, and it hurts me, seeing how the game where i've met my best friends which for pure casuality are from my same city, where i've spend hours and hours playing this, it hurts me feeling like they just want the older poeple stop playing, with this kind of things, where the only content that the game receives so far is only directioned at the same kind of public or people, it's not something it can be negated, since its already happening (and has been for a really long time.)

First is the main story quest. As a returning player i had to finish the post story for a realm reborn, heavensward, post story for heavensward, stormblood. I came back with my friend, he ESC passed through the entire story while i watched it, he ended up finishing the story much faster than me due to my work schedule and hte fact that i actually wanted to see the story. It ended up taking me 3 weeks to finish stormblood. Note i said stormblood and not the post stormblood content required to actually do shit with my friend who finished it all in a few days. I couldnt do dungeons with him, i couldnt raid with him, i couldnt even spend my freaking tokens because i had to do 300+ goddamned story quests just to unlock rhalgar reach token npc. I asked on the forums and reddit what to do about this, and was greeted with, drop 25 bucks to skip the story, which doesnt help me since im basically being told to spend money to delete content. Who freaking designed this, why is it still here? I just returned to swtor 3 days ago, i love that when i get bored of the story i can go pvp, i can go raid, i can go do any dungeon i want. Im not being told to slog through every story quest first before i can deviate off the path. My friend got bored and quit, as before, he hit end game and it was back to 450 tokens a week, 4 or 5 boss fights for tokens and fuck all else to do in between.

Which brings me to the second issue, That fucking token system... it has to go. It was the reason i quite 4 years ago after turn 5. Its the reason i dont really want to log in now. I dont have a lot of time to play. But when i do have time, i dont want to be done in 3 hours because i capped all my tokens and there are literally no other rewards to get. Gear an alt? Cant, my tokens are capped.

What makes it worst is finally, the level sync system, what a great idea with poor implementation. I love final fantasy's dungeons, but everything is so goddamned tightly level gated that when you hit max level you are stuck with 3 dungeons to farm out of the dozens or so available. How does this even happen when games like star wars the old republic exists, that has the same level sync system instead they sync EVERY dungeon to max level, and you can do every dungeon, every raid, and be properly reward thanks to their galactic command system, WHICH MAKES SENSE.

Every dungeon in final fantasy should be level sync to max level, and characters bolstered up to max level, every dungeon should have an easy, normal, nightmare and savage mode. I think there is no need for a bunch of freaking tokens, mendacity, poetic, verity, fuck off. 1 token, and an upgrade system, you buy a piece of token gear, then every tier after that builds on the previous piece of gear with more tokens and more vendor consumables.

Im not inspired by eureka at all right now, ff14 strong point is dungeons, its combat system is slow and tedious, so a grinding system does not even remotely sound fun. I think this month i will play swtor and check back with ff14 next expansion.",SakariFoxx,2018-03-14 12:11:15

Misunderstanding what is fun and reward structure.,968,2018-03-13 22:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/848d1g/a_design_philosophy_flaw_misunderstanding_what_is/,ffxiv,">those of us playing since ARR launch have actually seen very little to no improvement on content areas or significant changes, ilustrated on how basically dungeon and raid design has stayed the same through more than 4 years now.

So while I didn't stop reading here, I do want to point out that the reason I'm sticking to FFXIV and still holding my sub is because of the consistency of this content.

I don't want something new.  I want updated raids and dungeons that keep my sub going.  I want regular content.

And the only thing making me want to unsub at all is if we get less of this content.  And currently, we *are* getting less of this content.  But I'm still here because, frankly, I still enjoy what's left of the dungeons and the raid tier we're getting.  I personally am enjoying the hell out of sigma savage, and I even changed it up by going DPS this tier instead of tank.

I'm not the only one who'd rather have the old 3 dungeons of ARR per patch.  I'm not some small minority of players.  I belong to a group of players that probably hold the majority of the consistent sub base.

And I get that there's plenty of players that want new content that spices things up or does new things, and I get that there has to be a dev team that appeals to this so that the game isn't some stale, endgame elitist machine (I don't even like the term ""elitist"" in this, since many players participate in savage even if they can't or won't clear the 4th floor, or even participate in ultimate content, and they are totally content with this).

But the thing is, we took away from the grind that a lot of players were ok with (3 dungeons per patch, a raid tier every other patch) in order to create content that nobody has ever been happy with (except POTD, and well, that appeal ran out).

You have to remember that a lot of players that flocked to this MMO were hardcore raiders furious at other games not fulfilling their needs, whether it be Wildstar, SWTOR (which killed their raiding community), or even Warcraft players that want to raid and gear race on two games.  These players are what hold the base of the sub, and these are the players that sub models are **designed** to keep happy, since all you really have to do is churn out content and keep it fresh (and yes, you **can** keep dungeons and raids fresh).

The others that flocked to this MMO wanted the community and they got it.  And I'm happy they're here.  But I'm not happy with the constant demands for content in an MMO that do not fit an MMO.  You want all sorts of content, like chocobo racing, gold saucer, Eureka, exploratory content like Diadem, and then when it finally churns out, you forget that we're playing an MMO designed around endgame progression, not social stuff.  It doesn't matter how many emotes SE churns out, or how many open world things SE churns out, it gets stale fast when the core is designed around endgame progression.

I want my 3 dungeons per patch back.  I'm not gonna get that back, and I'm somewhat ok with that because I'm still enjoying endgame for what it is.

But in the meantime I'm watching a bunch of players complaining when you're literally asking for things that won't work, then complaining that it's not working, and then backtracking saying ""well it would have worked if--"" except you forget that this is an MMO that revolves around the majority that keeps paying for a constantly updated endgame.  If they made the grind easier or less, then it would just be a stale endgame where everyone gets tier 3 gearset in a week and then nobody would want to sub anymore.  Then nobody would be happy.

I don't know what else to put here, this is more of me venting my thoughts.  I don't **know** how to make non raiders happy, but I will say demanding random shit like Blitzball and Open World Exploration is not the answer.  You can't make yourself happy by trying to turn the MMO into something that it isn't.

Bottom line, which is me just pasting a paragraph that really sums up my thoughts:

>**But the thing is, we took away from the grind that a lot of players were ok with (3 dungeons per patch, a raid tier every other patch) in order to create content that nobody has ever been happy with (except POTD, and well, that appeal ran out).**",KShrike,2018-03-14 16:26:11

I don't really enjoy much of the group content in the game, even with friends, so I don't run dungeons/trials, the higher level maps are no longer an option, and now Eureka is content I'm not interested in unless it's possible to solo once the hype has died down a little and the mobs aren't being tagged before I can tag them. 

It's been a (mostly) fun 4.5 years but I think at the back of my mind I know I'm probably just done.

took me 6 years to get a Dchap+1 in FFXI. I was ecstatic. Ive never felt rewarded in this game about gear ive ever received. Its all handed to you through tokens. Its a joke. The only things that have made me feel happy to get are mounts and minions. Gear is redundant.

The game designers have forgotten that they‚Äôre working on an MMO. And that actually ties directly into the fact that time is the only currency for rewards.

When all people can trade for almost all rewards in the game is time spent doing menial tasks, you can be sure they‚Äôll find the most efficient way to achieve that goal, right? The problem is that nearly every effective path to any reward in the game is now instanced with the addition of Eureka: Dungeons roulettes, raids, PotD (for levelling up to 60), Eureka.

What this means is that the game ends up funnelling everyone out of the non-instanced world itself and into locked rooms where they all struggle separately in small groups, blind to the rest of the world. Social interaction ends up almost exclusively restricted to idling in cities or around housing area where the only activities you can perform are crafting and market board flipping.

Now I can only speak for myself and I am well aware I am likely in a minority here, but the reason I play MMO‚Äôs - and why I fell in love with ARR at launch too - isn‚Äôt the grinding or the protracted reward structures. It‚Äôs the world, the lore, and most importantly the fact that it‚Äôs inhabited by real people. Flawed, imperfect, confused, happy and sad *people*.

The multiple carrots on the end of the stick isn‚Äôt my reason to be in these games; it‚Äôs reasons to get me to work with or against other real fleshy meat-bag people living through their avatars around me.

You might now be thinking that there‚Äôs nothing stopping people like me from socialising and hanging out instead of ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù content that makes everyone do the same, and you‚Äôre not inherently wrong if so. But let me ask you this: In reality space, how easy do you find it to meet and get to know new people in a large city where everyone‚Äôs already out and about, going this way and that, potentially already busy meeting people they already know? Now add to that fact that in an MMO people can be busy speaking to any number of people invisibly through text without you knowing it.

How much easier isn‚Äôt it to bond with new people in a shared activity where there is also *downtime* for interaction to happen, and where you do not immediately split up and disappear once said activity is over? This holds true in real life and it holds double true in MMO‚Äôs where ignoring people is even easier than real life.

In that regard Eureka might be an improvement in terms of instanced content; at least it blends together up to 100 players and ask them to team up over extended time to grind content, with no time limit. But the joke is that they already had this kind of thing in the game already; the rest of Eorzea itself. Alas they filled that with activities that are mostly only efficient solo, like story quests, beast tribe quests and gathering. The only remaining ‚Äúopen world‚Äù activity is hunts, but that sees people teleport hither and tither with great frequency.

Maybe I‚Äôm just longing for a time gone by in terms of MMO design. It seems the industry unanimously agreed that grind was all there was to learn from the MMO‚Äôs of old, and decided to minimize friction on all levels, seeing things like dungeon finders, roulettes, and instanced content as the way to keep players from experiencing downtime unless they specifically look for it. There‚Äôs a reason people long for XI or vanilla WoW and when I ask people what it is they miss the most, it‚Äôs the adventures these games caused with random people. It‚Äôs not the grind itself they miss, but what was structured around it. Maybe there‚Äôs a way to bring that mentality into modern times without only taking the grind and forgetting everything that made the games such social experiences?

Most of my time actually playing XIV, when not in a city or housing area idling, feels like a singleplayer game with occasional multiplayer events. Except with astronomical demands on my time should I decide to chase any of the shiny carrots dangled before me. That seems to be what MMO‚Äôs are today. And so I keep drifting further and further away from them.",[deleted],2018-03-14 07:29:17

I don't know if it's because I spent 9 years on FFXI which was anything BUT formulaic in its content, but playing an MMO where you can predict what each patch is going to have, what each expansion will have, doesn't feel enjoyable.

It's worked till this point but its becoming stale. Even new content is becoming stale. I won't say XI didn't have its flaws, believe me it did, but if Eureka is supposed to be something akin to XI content it severely missed the mark. And part of it is due to the ineptitude and unfamiliarity players have with this kind of content. Grinding for 10 hours for a couple of levels and barely enough crystals to get something isn't fun. Going to an NM only to get one shot because people dragged and didn't kill adds - and then LOSING the work you put in over the last few hours, isn't fun.

On top of that there is no 'feat of strength' or unique stuff you can get from a raid in a certain timeframe, which World of Warcraft does have. Player retention is better for WoW because its endgame reward structure is better. It's about getting a clear before the next patch in the highest difficulty and then just farming it and selecting people for the next tier of content. It's more fun and more rewarding. 

The endgame in FFXIV needs more thought, I imagine the player retention at max level is awful since its so unrewarding to play. ",[deleted],2018-03-14 09:18:42

The post seems to eventually come to Eureka and how it is ""bad design"", which I won't argue that it isn't implemented in a fun way, but it is implemented in the scope of how FFXIV works.

FFXIV is at the end of the day a casual MMO, it isn't hardcore but has some hardcore tendencies that don't require the cooperation and coordination that say a raid in WoW would have. Each instance is building off the last one, there isn't a mechanic in the game that has not been presented to you in the past in some way. The end game raids are a culmination of everything you've learned. The SB expansion introduced new mechanics, but was relatively ""safe"" in how the content was created. It did new things, but kept a majority of classic mechanics we've all done the past 4 years. But the idea of FFXIV as Yoshida has said before is that it's like a bike, you can get off for a while but come back and play like you never left in the first place. 

I wouldn't say gear irrelevancy is a detriment to the game, as this game is an MMO and it's about getting gear to get better gear to get the next better gear. 

FFXIV is also unique compared to other MMOs as it has a storyline in which your character has DIRECT impact on the story and isn't just a bystander. Which is personally a reason for me that brought me to FFXIV.

There is a lack of true player interactions because most of the content, if not all, is really easy to do. Party synergy is non-existent in this game as supporting abilities aren't a necessity. But they didn't want to make this game too difficult, they want everyone to have a chance at everything. Bard for example was a supporting class, but was treated more and more as DPS and its support abilities weren't very useful as they weren't really necessary for anything. FFXIV is mainly dodge, DPS, hold point, activate point (with the exception of very few variances like Neverreap, and some new instances from SB). The most extreme thing that you might do is tank switch, otherwise content is straightforward. If you want to get rid of the boredom of the grind we might want to look into making the game more difficult. (this kind of falls into the topic of dead content)",zerosyndicate,2018-03-14 19:42:29

There's maybe a 5-10% chance that the new thing will be the greatest thing since sliced bread, and a far greater chance that it will fall flat, and even cause a fandom riot.

That, and people are known to react very angrily when they're a fan of something, and that thing changes. We all know what happened to Metallica in the 1990s, or what happened every time George Lucas introduced a new Star Wars edition.

FF XIV tends to play it safe, because most every time they took a risk with something, it fell flat. They once made a dungeon with multiple routes through it - and everyone just took the most optimal route through it, so now we're stuck with perfectly linear dungeons. They introduced an RTS mini-game - and no one played it, mainly because no one cared about the reward. They introduced experimental content - and people only did what they had to do to get ph4t l00t, and nothing else. They once (back in 2.1) made the end-game dungeons somewhat difficult - and the community decided they'd rather have a root canal than play them, which is why we're stuck with easy dungeons.

That's why we get easy, grind-y content with the occasional story update; because people generally like it better than experimental changes that have a tiny chance of being awesome and a high chance of completely failing. And when failing badly enough can end them, I can't blame them.",TheDragonSlayingCat,2018-03-14 16:02:02

When Alexander came out and I saw the Normal mode versions of the fights.  I'mm all for inclusion but what was special about Coil to me was just hearing about cool fights and getting better to one day see them and perform to my best.  Seeing the content as weekly grind normal mode just kinda killed my interest in the raids because they're not new anymore.

Extending to the rest of the game, I think the thing that I lost and most want to see, is that I want to grind in order to see content, not get better gear.  T9 locking out Final Coil was cool because there was a real roadblock and test to overcome.  Now every boss is just handed out and it makes all their cool shit and ultimate moves and mechanics are just kinda muted in their savage modes.

Fighting my way to cool fights and to see new content is a much better incentive for me to do my dailies and study things up.  In fact the coolest thing for me was when Palace of the Dead came out  and there was a huge dungeon to crawl to see a cool end area and final boss.  Instead the game is so afraid of people missing out anymore that it just hands all the cool fights to people for free in an unsatisfying easy mode.",HyMyNameIsMatt,2018-03-14 01:29:57

1. involve all the classes a player levels in better ways. It's stupid I can do savage and get one gear piece for Healer but all my other level 70 DPS get nothing and i am locked out of getting any other gear piece. I think the game should encourage and help more with alt-classes progression;

2. use ""formulas"" with caution. It must feel nice to have it all planned out that we're getting 2 HM dungeons now, 4 Savage turns then, 1 ultimate here and so on, but i wish they would stop going for the formula at all costs and allow themselves time to think thoroughly about what they're doing. I would rather wait more time for something if it offers me something unique, not reused, if it feels like a better accomplishment in the end. People are going to un-sub and re-sub all the time, but for the while that i'm subbed, give me something to remember, something i haven't seen before (like that cinematic at the end of T12), something that i want to fight and come back for;

3. stop recycling gear, content, etc so much. I'd like new and unique things and i am not impressed when you recolor something or do a Starlight event where i get tabletop food. I prefer to wait for this instead of being disappointed at every step you reuse, and reusing feels cheap.

I played this game non-stop from 2.0 until 3.1 or so. But ever since then, I've been a very on-off player, only playing when I feel like it.
And the funny thing is, in 3.1, I would've agreed to this post. 
But today? I don't agree. At all.

Why? Because there are tons of things people enjoy in this game for what it is, for the journey. I scour through the comments, and some of them even say they want more interesting rewards (unique gear) instead of a more engaging process.

Personally, I love the story. I love the characters, I love the lore, side story and whatever else we get. It's a fun romp every 3 months. I love the areas and how they look, it's pleasant just looking around, or doing things like maps/beast tribes/gathering/sidequesting/sightseeing hunts. They are enjoyable processes,
I go in with my team to try and kill Phantom Train, Chaddarnook, the Guardian and Kefka every week because I think the fights are fun. They are flashy, they have fun mechanics, and it's fun having to do mechanics as a group and really get together. I never do it for the weapon/chestpiece/mount in the end, they are just a part of my eventual BiS.
I enjoy every even patch to go through the calculator and buildpath for my potential BiS, what pieces I should aim for and what path I should take.
I just had a friend redecorate my entire tiny house in Shirogane. I don't particularly enjoy the furnishing aspect too much, and I suck at decorating. But she spent hours and hours on fixing up my house and she made it beautiful. Why? Because she enjoyed doing it, no other reason. That's also a person that mostly crafts and gathers in the game, because they enjoy it.

Just look right now. I can collect and play Triple Triad, play Chocobo Racing and breed Chocobos, do a Gold Saucer event every 30 minutes, do a weekly glamour guessing game which makes use of old gear and incentives you to go out there and craft/obtain pieces you think you need.
I still have an uncomplete sightseeing log, and I had fun doing the jump puzzles. There's a surprising amount of jump puzzles around the world that might've not all have been intentional, but still fun.

I collect orchestrion rolls, check what fish I can have in my aquarium, enjoy seeing how people can fail simple mechanics in 24-mans, enjoying trying to be even faster with expert roulette with my friends whilst talking about whatever. I slowly gear off-classes that I sometimes do things with, usually with spare gear or dungeon gear obtained through just expert roulettes.

Pimping my squadron was fun, and I did dungeons with them not for a grind, but for the fun of it.
Hildibrand is always a good laugh.
I enjoy custom deliveries and their side stories. It's fun and simple crafting.
I enjoy sending out my retainers to do things for me.
I enjoy finding new ways to glamour as I get new pieces.

I didn't enjoy Diadem, I don't enjoy Eureka too much, I loved PotD and can't wait for how they'll revise it for the next patch. I am not too big of a fan of expert trials since they are a bit... bland in my eyes. They are fun to do once and then they become a bit grindy in my eyes.

But those things I didn't enjoy? I just didn't do them. I don't even have a Heavensward relic because it just wasn't fun. Why do it?

I've noticed that alot of people are what I was. Online all the time, doing stuff all the time. That's not healthy, the game will just become a grind to you. I think that it might be better for you to be reflective of your own behaviour patterns, since it sounds to me like you're causing yourself much suffering by begrudgingly going through all this. If it isn't for you, and it has been such a downward slope, how come you haven't been elsewhere since? What's forcing you to stay for so long that you become annoyed? It sounds like an unhealthy addiction.
I promise you, play this game more casually and for what it is, and you'll enjoy it. Take breaks and stop playing when you don't want to, and come back when you want to. I only raidlog at the moment since the game isn't too interesting right now to me. But it will come with things I will be interested in, as well as my want to collect triple triad, or enjoying hunting songs or farming birds. I don't know man. I feel like the reflexive part of your post is solely on FFXIV. I don't know you at all, but I'd say the reflexive perspective could also be used on yourself.

Only read complaints and no real suggestions.
Gear progression is as it is because raiders complained in the past that they want their gear to be the best available gear.
Eureka is a grind, and obviously a throwback to old school MMO. (Heard comparison to FFXI and Ragnarok Online)
It is some sort of fan service in this way.
And I don't think there is anything wrong with it. 
Don't like it?..well...don't play it. The game is full of other things to do. 
With varried content like we have in this game, there is no way to please every player.
Some like crafting, some hate it.
Some like gold saucer, some hate it.
Some only play for raid, some do not care.
Some praised PoTD, some hated it. (I found it less interesting than Eureka in term of progression/willingness to farm it)

And yes you have some nice glamor/minion locked behind this content that some will not like. Just like in any other content, including lord of verminion and chocobo races.

Is it worse, in term of brain activity, than the book step of the first relic when it launched? Is it worse than light farming for the first relic (remember running the first dungeon in the game in a loop at level 50?)? At least we have a mechanic in Eureka with the elemental wheel that requires the player to be a little bit careful when he plays...

People seemed to forget what relic weapon is about. It is basically the content made for people who want to grind for a long time. 
What did people expect?...

What OP and many people in the sub don't seem to get is that this is fun or nostalgic for a large number of people, the grand majority of whom never speak up.

Yoshida has said that relic grinds are not here to be fun. They are grinds, and grinds aren't fun. But it's the only way to balance the content engagement wise with respect to raiding, primal farming, tomestone and time investment, etc. So while he did not enjoy it himself, he knows that the developers need to make something grindy for the relic every tier because otherwise there'd be no real challenge.

Eureka honestly isn't too bad. It needs some adjustments and quality of life changes, but for the most part, it's a nice change of pace. The REAL thing that's driving me nuts right now is the weekly Tome Grind. Oh my lord in heaven, I am so incredibly tired of that grind each and every single little week! It wouldn't be so bad if I could just do anything I wanted and have a reasonable expectation of capping. But no, if I do Stormblood trials, I'm likely to come up short unless I no-life it. If I do Heavensward or ARR trials, I don't get any tomes at all.

I was honestly hoping Eureka would give a fair amount of tomes, if only so I could use it as a replacement for dungeon roulette. No, at this point, while Eureka could use some work, the tome grind a far more frustrating problem for me. It's boring, it's repetitive, and it feels like an obligation. The only factor that makes it bearable for me, is that I can ignore it once I get all the pieces I need for my main class. But, that doesn't really work for people that play multiple classes.

What I think I'd prefer, is that they put in some sort of token's that drop randomly for both trials, dungeons, PVP, Eureka, WHATEVER. You need X and Y number of tokens to get gear, but you can farm as many of those tokens you want per week. The kicker would be that, while you can farm as many as you want, you can only purchase one piece of armor or an accessory per week, with the weapon being acquired differently.

So basically, if you have one week with a ton of free time, you could theoretically get several weeks worth of tokens farmed up for the future. I'd personally appreciate that sort of flexibility. There are some weeks where I don't mind jumping into a ton of dungeon runs, while other times I just want to farm birds, doggo's, or spend my time learning how to clear one of the raids.

That doesn't change that the game probably does need a new piece of tentpole content. Nor does it change that Eureka isn't where it should be at the moment. Regardless, I don't think Eureka is the core or the problem. If the rest of the game felt fresh, people wouldn't care as much that Eureka still needs some work. I dare say, people would probably be excited to see where they were going to take the content once they started building it up.

But, while I still enjoy the rest of the game, it feels like it needs a major shakeup.",Wolven0ne,2018-03-14 08:22:18

This kind of content is not new, it's the bread and butter of MMORPG, as devs have to find some way of making us stay online longer.

I have been reading a lot about Eureka this past few days and I think the question raised the most, even though most people don't seem to put it in words to themselves, is:

**Why do I keep playing ?**

Now please understand that I am in no way trying to insult anyone with a disguised ""If you don't like it, don't play."" The question is personnal, it is about your own relationship to the game. It is one I have been asking myself a lot on MMORPG since my early days on FFXI and WoW.

Asking oneself why one keeps playing a game means understanding what the purpose of a game is. And the answer is always the same: the purpose of a game is to entertain players.

Entertainment has a different definition for different individuals: it may be being challenged to do something, having a way to goof around with friends, doing something pleasant to forget real life for a while, you name it, it can be whatever you feel like.

The point is: entertainment is supposed to make you happy. It's implied that you wish to be pleasantly entertained. The reason -as human beings- we do anything is either because we have to, or because we want to. We do what we must because we have no choice, and we choose to do what we like because it makes our lives better.

Eureka seems to be the last straw that breaks the camel's back for players who do not wish to question their relationship to the game.

Ask yourself why you keep doing this. Gear, glamour, the achievement of managing something in game, etc. You get nothing tangible out of it. You are supposed to be having a good time, to be having fun, to be able to think fondly on your game time and feel happy about it, and nothing more.

There is no actual meaning to anything you do in game. Why are you doing Eureka ? You want the relic weapon. Why ? Is it going to be better ? What is it going to be better for ? Do you want to slave over a piece of equipment for the sake of having it ? Even when you dislike doing it ?

**TL;DR:** Don't keep at something you dislike doing, and complain to the devs that they're not doing a good job. You're not going to miss out, you're not going to fall behind. It's a game. No one cares, no one is impressed. Stop forcing yourself to do things that you don't enjoy in the hopes that things will change.

It's not your job to create content, you're the consumer. Say that you don't like it, don't play it, you may even take a break from the game and play something else for a while. If they see that people don't care for the content and leave, they'll do better. Or the game will die, but all things do eventually.

I‚Äôve moved to guild wars 2 from ffxiv, and it‚Äôs a great game. I decided to craft a legendary weapon. The path to doing that is perhaps more fun and interesting than anything I‚Äôve done in FF. It encourages, or even requires, the player to engage with nearly all of the different content in the game‚Äîand that has far more variation: small party dungeons, zone-wide open world events, pvp, crafting, achievements, minigames, zone exploration, jumping puzzles... the list goes on.

The reward system is mostly incremental, giving each step more meaning as you have small concrete goals that act as stepping stones to the larger final goal.

In all, it seems to me that gw2‚Äôs content and reward systems are far more enjoyable than ffxiv‚Äôs. The combat feels more rough and tumble and not as polished (although this is partly by designed), and the graphics and world design probably lose out, but in terms of actual gameplay, gw2 pulls very far ahead. Even the glamour system is better. ",thaumielprofundus,2018-03-14 12:25:37

Like, they've tried Diadem 3 times now, to pretty significant negative response each time. That's actively taking risks from a design perspective, gambling that more resources and time will 'get it right' when it would be easier to stick to a two dungeon/patch thing or just do more deep dungeons. Most every other major patch introduces something new (PotD, Diadem, Gold Saucer, etc) that breaks up and offers new gameplay. Similarly, SB has seen a lot of new types of sidequest features (the picture-clue hunts, dart minigames, etc) more varied and interesting use of solo instances, etc. 


If anything, the game is actually quite experimental in most content, to the point that basic stuff (dungeons) seems to get done with essentially the bare minimum most of the time, while resources are pushed to riskier areas (Diadem, PotD, Eureka, Ultimate, etc). Some of these work, some of them don't, that's the nature of experimentation. Overall, they've probably had more hits than misses with this. They also have a fairly good track record at adjusting things the second time around to be better (Gold Saucer, Even low level PotD after coffers and whatnot). 


Where there are issues, I think they're pretty much two-fold, and don't really hit on inadequate risk-taking or experimentation. 


1. Inadequate feedback mechanisms. It would be great to have a test server for PotD or Aquapolis or Eureka; no story, no spoilery stuff or new raid battles, just new things and systems in a stripped down version. Yes, this would dampen the surprise, but it would also give a very good opportunity to get feedback like ""Put more dailies or miniquests or whatever in it"". More fundamentally, we need surveys and systematic means of gathering feedback on new types of content from a generalizable and broad sample of players. People want to share their opinions or communities like this subreddit wouldn't be so big, but the devs apparently only found out about Ungarmax a week or two ago. When feedback does get attention, it's often in a weird or haphazard way that doesn't really catch a lot of opinions. Someone got to someone high up at a fanfest and publicly asked a question about chargeback suspensions or something, or there's a dramatic event or blowup on the forums or a few angry voices blew something out of proportion. This suggests that there simply aren't good mechanisms of communication between players and devs, and that's an issue. Hell, put periodic surveys in game. Give tomestones for completing them and make them short and easy. Some of Eureka's biggest problems (the lack of anything, such as a few easy dailies or whatever to break up/mitigate the grind for a casual or slow playstyle and the very very slow leveling process) would be incredibly easy to fix if the devs had feedback and info before this mess went live, or had a good way of getting it now. 



2. The backbone of progression is quite simple and inflexible, and revising that means revising the entire battle system to a fairly significant degree. This means that loot is somewhat limited. They've pushed around this a tad (rng diadem loot) but never in a good or interesting way, and it's hard to see where they *could* do much more with the game as it is. What would be needed to make rewards more interesting are ground-level changes to the way gear works. That's unlikely to happen mid-expansion simply as it would be a logistic nightmare, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised if, with 4.X swapping jobs up and adding gauges to diversify jobs a bit more (perhaps a few too many gauges), 5.X turns to gear and helps that out some, but there's a lot to do for an expansion, and making core changes to the basic game system means everything needs to be rebalanced and designed.

I've played about 12 of the 14 months since I've started and I've found it interesting how things are structured, how they differ and how sometimes the design goes against its mission statement and even creates deficits in job population that fuel the dev team's perception of what players want.

I've heard it said by Yoshida the majority of people prefer playing DPS so they made more DPS jobs for Stormblood. I don't think that's true, I think the design of the game rewards healers and tanks better more quickly and pulls them out of rotation for so much content they are desired in.

But it's a chicken and egg thing. They have incentivized the hell out of playing tank, but there's this myth among players the role is stressful. It can be at higher levels especially when it feels like there's a contest going on between the tanks.

When I've tried to learn to share tanking duties it's more like pickup co-tanks want to fight for aggro. I've even seen his go down in Sigmascape 3.0 where the MT just wants it all and detests letting the OT help out.

Solo tanking though? Nah, no stress. You get the snippy healer or DPS every now and again, but I've never seen tremendous stress thrown my way. 

I've seen this sort of player myth creation in FFXI. Ranger and Corsair were ""too expensive"" (You DPS with cheap stuff and weapinskill with the good stuff) Just inviting a Beastmaster was said to lower group EXP (not with crafted jug pets). Also work pointing out WAR, PLD, MNK, DRG, SMN and BLM all had turns and being deemed useless and that was never true. Players create myths the devs sometimes cannot control or contain.

The myth that tanking is this super stressful job people will totally hate you for if you slightly screw up is bullshit. Same with healers. I had a healer in Qarn that must have gotten my Warrior killed six times by not healing fast enough and never once did I bite her head off. It's Qarn. People are still learning. I just keep that as my assumption because it's the healthiest one I can think to have.

So that exists and plays into the dev team's beliefs because, well, my tanking queues are still instant. I do doubt the chicken little reactions about job adjustments and new content are taken as seriously. I mesn, just weeks ago the idea the WAR buff was actually a nerf was going around.

Going back to lockouts and reward loops, for raids would following the structure of the 24-man rewards wealth be so bad. One piece of armor a week, no dumb cranks, bolts and such. I walked out of the 4.1 Rabanastre pretty happy even with the lockouts and kept queuing into it until a few weeks into this update.

Five weeks vs. About 2 1/2 months for a full set of armor and a weapon. It's clear which is better to me and people would move into other roles to  go back and get reads there again later.

If there was any threat to Savage, it's not going to be the speed-running and world-first types or people that just want the extra challenge that will suffer. They would still find each other.",Faeona,2018-03-14 01:58:11

Unless you raid, it takes 15 weeks to get a full tomestone set that is current.  Then on top of that it takes another 12 weeks (shortened by hunts) once the 24 man releases and you can get your weekly upgrade mats.  

That means without raiding you are locked in to a single job ( with some gear sharing minus weapon working the same role) for an entire raid cycle.  

If you do raid, this can be shortened based upon a combination of luck and group success, but there is no REAL ability to switch jobs in meaningful content unless you stick yourself behind the eight ball.  If you want a system where people can freely change, you can't have that these arbitrary limits like we have with tomestones.  What we have isn't really choice once we buy the first piece of gear at the start of a tomestone cycle.

It's supposed to be a grind. The reward's overly bad, but that's the design. It's always been that, a glamour. The few times relics were BiS it was just some small substats over the endgame raid weapon, and it was often just a month or two before the next raid weapon came out.


Should FF14 change how rewards versus time works? Maybe. It's annoying as a hardcore player seeing people walk around in dungeon gear just as good as mine. But the game's catered to casuals, and if you can't do the Eruka grind, you're not the type who would suddenly find themselves beating Ultimate Bahamut no problem.

I still love the game but I do feel that I'm burning out on it a bit. I only have a limited amount of time to play each day so I always find myself doing the exact same things: Assign two ventures, do an alliance roulette, do a trial roulette, do the mini cactpot, do three Ananta quests.

I hoped that Eureka would offer a compelling alternative to this routine, but it doesn't. It's just insanely grindy, for worse gear than I can get from Mendacity tomes.

I think that part of the problem is that there's no real variation in playstyle. Every level 70 is geared in basically exactly the same way, and the best gear is the one with the highest number. There's no variation in sub stats or special gear abilities.

Every properly equipped bard will have *x* gear with *y* materia melded to it and they'll carry *z* weapon.

That being said, FF14 has all the tools to do this. However, several since Heavensward, it seems to be their intent to shy away from this as much as possible. Gear is seldom interchangable. If it's cross class gear, the stats rarely transfer gracefully, as classes have their own secondary stat weights. Cross class skills have been taken away and replaced with cross roles. Gear is timelocked, so you cannot gear two different classes with ease. Even levelling alt classes have been timelocked. Fates have been replaced by dailies.

Then you put things on the table, and realize that the GCD system which is pillar on this game, is greatly limiting the potential to bring new stuff to the gaming experience of the game. At the same time, Yoshi said once that he doesn't expect that people play 24/7; basically, the idea of this game is to get back once new content is released, you enjoy ""the new stuff"", then move on to the next game until there's another update. It's gonna take lots of time until they stop holding to this idea, and this means that things aren't going to change at all...... if we don't keep doing things like the big ass upvoted Eureka thread noise, but for more consistent elements: the ones you're stating. Personally, I play little because I have rl stuff to take care of, so I keep enjoying a regular Expert run, or some Savages, or some EX primals, etc. while I focus on my main and alt-gearing in the process. I keep enjoying it because of the time factor, and so we get back to the topic of what Yoshi said once about how many time this game is meant to be played. A pathetic excuse that I hope they throw soon to the trash.

Edit: I do play since 2.4 or so, just saying, about my personal take on enjoyment for this game which I stated.",Goltana,2018-03-14 13:16:24

Most if not all of these apply to literally every long-standing videogame in history. Also, the ""fun factor"" isn't made equal and doesn't equally apply to every player. This is one of the hardest things designers have to deal with. There isn't a textbook solution for this. 

If you play *any* game for enough time, you'll get sick of it. It doesn't matter how much content the game throws at you because it's extremely unlikely that the core structure can be changed. Professional players deal harshly with this too, and I don't think anyone in their right minds would argue that Counter-strike or Dota are badly designed games.

Looking into game design as an answer to what you feel is a great idea. But before anyone does that, try looking at the basics first.

For example: The fact that no videogame can truly hold any player's attention for literally years, because that is not how the human brain works unless that particular person is extremely passionate about the task. And people who are extremely passionate about anything at a very small minority in any hobby.",A_Literal_Ferret,2018-03-14 13:46:14

 the over world's scenery is amazing but its empty and boring leaving leveling to be dungeon spamming and fates doesn't make it any less boring.

 game play is too WoW like with CDs and class specializations (tanks, dps, Healer). 

final fantasy games have been about strategy between tactical gear switching, usable items, elemental resistances and weaknesses, buffs, status, magic etc.

 End game and optional content is grindy.

 pvp is boring and imbalanced (probably the worst iv'e played in an mmo).

crafting needs an incredible amount of time put in to be successful at making a profit.

 Raid content is just hard mode content you've already seen. the Ts were more interesting because exceptional raiders were the ones to experience new bosses and fight them and that seemed rewarding on its own.

I saw my friend grinding Sephiroth 7 hours a day to get rewards, which I knew would become obsolete in a month. So I just didn't care. Now in Stormblood, I just got 4-5 Seph weapons like candy, due to the boss being so easy now. Didn't even have to try.

I do believe that level sync is part of the problem. When something stops being a challenge, the reward becomes moot (Also, mind you, a grind is not a challenge), There's nothing cool about a cool weapon when it's so common AND obsolete. If weapons and equips had special properties instead of just better stats, it would be more interesting. We could have... builds, variations, playstyles, and not a threadmill. Imagine some monk fists that make Elixir Field transform into a horizontal beam instead of a circle aoe. Waaaays to add flavor to the game, but everything is a threadmill.

Today I've spent 3 hours in Eureka. It drained everything that I loved about this game from me.

I fell in love with FFXIV due to great story, decent progress, lots of side activities to explore, amazing music, wonderful visuals and lots of casual side activities.
Eureka feels like it's an MMO from 18 years ago. It is slow, boring, grindy and devoid of anything but enemy killing. It depends on having a huge community to keep things moving, else it is a complete slog.
by the time I entered, most were in levels 8-13. Meaning I had to death run, or grind by myself. I did death run after 1 hour and only 1 level gained, but I could not get much experience from fates, feeling forced to backtrack to mindless killing on lonesome self.
Eureka breaks all the rules of fun co-operative play. - it has no quests or mysteries. Just enemies. - leveling takes a very long time. - it leaves newer players behind - it will become inhospitable once the hype dies down as there won't be enough people to keep it going.

Honestly this is worse than diadem. It is completely not what I expected and I can not see the appeal for it. I would be regretting resubbing now if not for the fact that I have an alt to level and the ability to experience the whole story all over again. However, I feel like Eureka was a mistake and is totally not the way forward. If this is SE's way forward, I fear about what is to come.

I really only play one job at a time depending on the ""balances"" made per patch. Currently Sam is my main and I obviously won't be raiding on that because it's not ""utility"" enough, and outside of warrior none of the other jobs are rewarding to me because the jobs that have the most potential to be fun imo do little damage and I'm a DPS main, take ninja for example, it's worse than basically every other job in the game (DPS) until very high level of play and even then an equally skilled player of another job will wreck your DPS. My personal biggest issue is this DPS vs utility mindset where certain jobs are simply better than others based purely on numbers and not player skill, at least the disparity shouldn't be so massive that certain jobs per patch are seen as not worth brining to a raid etc. 

In term of grind, the grind had always been worth it to me because it shows how far you're willing to go and the skill level you're willing to play to,it's a badge of honor having something you know the majority won't get because of the effort it takes.

Then Heavensward was around the corner, I preordered and started leveling a Dark Knight asap. Once again, I enjoyed the story a lot and was also pretty excited, as I would finally be able to do endgame stuff too. So I hit 60, concluded the main quest, did the two new dungeons, unlocked, tried (and failed) at Bismarck Ex and.. then I just sat there. I still remember how slightly confused I was. What was I supposed to do from here on? Just grind the same few dungeons over and over again.. so I would be able to then do the same with the primals and raids? Surely there had to be some other kind of progression, I thought. Well, we all know the answer to that.

Suddenly, the game that had grown to be my favorite MMO felt completely different. No more story, nothing to diversify the endgame in any way. Just repetition of the same few bits of content over and over again. I tried to ""enjoy"" that for maybe two weeks, then just quit disappointedly.

Fast forward almost two years, 3.55 dropped and with it I returned to the game. And once again I grew to love it. The 3.x story was epic, the dungeons were well made and Hildibrand was as funny as ever. I preordered Stormblood and was really looking forward to it. The leveling part, that is. Didn't expect much of the endgame this time, but I was still curious about it. As criticism was quite loud about the monotony up until then, I was pretty sure they'd concoct something for Stormblood.

When I reached 70 and it turned out to be pretty much the exact same thing, I was baffled. But I had still hope. Since they had overinflated the whole Eureka thing so much and even delayed it for long, I thought that'd finally be it. A different kind of endgame activity.
But, once again they managed to underwhelm and disappoint me, as Eureka proves to be shallow and hardly different from the old relic grinds - or any grind in this game, really. At this point I have just given it up and won't return until around 4.55. When it will finally feel like the content presented is worth my money again and doesn't just try to waste my time.

Honestly, I find it unbelievable how a team that creates an excellent game with so many different things to do can fail so badly at creating cap content that remains fresh and, most importantly, fun for longer than the first time / a few days. It's a real shame.",[deleted],2018-03-15 11:49:29

For combat, I think that more focus should be placed on individual skill. Give ninja more shukuchi stacks, give DRG multiple stacks of elusive jump, let BLM and other offensive mages warp to a position rather than another player, give healers and instant immunity shield for 1 attack, etc. I'd much rather see this than a flock of sheep running away from an AOE indicator, all at the same speed to where you can just follow others around.

After adding all of this, crank up the difficulty of the bosses and make more random chaos happen within. Maybe make the AOEs hit a little less hard than an insta-kill as they do now on fresh content, and happen more frequently (so that players can learn what is happening in the fight WHILE they try the new content).

This could be a terrible idea, but maybe there could be an individual skill rating system so that each player's skill is gauged in matchmaking, and the boss acts accordingly. Maybe targeting the higher skilled players more often with AOE, or possibly just setting the boss difficulty to an average skill level altogether. This would give some interesting variety to the fights. I would imagine that this skill number would have to be invisible in order to avoid a lot of problems with elitists and such.

Moving quickly through mobs, tackling higher level mobs than maybe we should have, having people die when they were too cocky or out of position made it a ton of fun.

However I sadly know that the progression starts to really slow after your first few levels and near then end when our EXP buff ran out and we were just farming the same mob for 20 min, I could feel the boredom set in.

It would be cool if there was a system in place that rewarded people moving from a mob to a different type of mob to keep it less stale.

If you succeed in making your way through it, then you unlock the final room, which holds a boss. Smack it, get a lot of loot, tomestones, gil, the works and return to the main instance.

Purely vertical progression is *awful*. I'm a raider between midcore/hardcore and I absolutely do not care about gear in this game.

I play simply to clear new content, for the fun of the fights. That wears off relatively quickly, especially on non-savage/ultimate content.

I prefer games where almost nobody is ever actually maxed out on progression, there's always something coming even if it's minor.

Like the OP says I think the same standard content cycle of grinding tomes in the same 2-3 dungeons each patch for gear so you can do a 4 boss raid and maybe a trial or two and sometimes taking a break to waste time with whatever gimmicky mindlessly repetitive side area was in the latest patch has worn out its welcome. 2.1-2.3 had some rough times as they tried to figure out what the gameplay loop would really be, but the game has been the exact same since 2.4 with the occasional shake-up in abilities with a couple of new jobs in HW and SB. 

Unending Coil seems like the first new successful idea since PotD, which itself was the first good idea literally since 2.4. They need more different types of the regular raid/dungeon gameplay, not these constant ""open zone"" grindfests because they're literally all just worse than FATES which have been around since 2.0.",Totaltotemic,2018-03-14 00:55:31

I bought Horizon Zero Dawn as a palate cleanser. The enjoyment I got from that offline constrained experience put FFXIV in a very unflatering perpective.


I really don't now what unique or worthy feature or experience the game aims to provide to their veteran playerbase. I can see what it offers to newcomers, but not to those that have been around for an entire expansion or more. The original selling point, the idea of ""seasons"" as in a TV series... you need good engaging writting for that to seem worth, but FFXIV is just boring and seem not to have any real stakes. There are not great plot twists, relatable characters or immersive world.


For FFXIV formula to work it should be delivering Game of Thrones Level writting so endgame content is just about picking more details about what is happening behind the scenes in the story and killing time between instalments, unfortunatelly it is very far from it. The last time the story was engaging in a patch was when we still thought the sultana was dead and the last time I was thrilled by the story in an expansion was when Shiva discovered she was delusional.

They took an established formula. They copied damn-near everything WoW had at the time of it's success. From the fetch/kill quest hopping to the linear dungeons and scripted boss battles. Not to mention the currency grind at cap. They embraced tab-targeting and established rotations rather than situational abilities. It could not be anymore blatantly taken from.

After that I think you hit the nail on the head. POST 2.0 innovations were added. But they weren't in places where they needed it the most. Even to this day, we're playing a VERY similar end game to what you find in damn-near every tab-target MMORPG. It's nothing special here. You grind currency while running old content. You do that until you can enter raids. They plop in newer versions of said content to keep the treadmill going. The core of the game really hasn't changed and probably won't. So, instead, their innovation continues to fall outside of their little safe bubble. Some of those stick (PotD, Treasure Maps, Aquapolis, etc), others do not. 

But regardless, again, I think you nail it with things needing to be shaken up again. I've seen cries for Mythic + type content. I say fuck it, why not? They've copied damn-near everything else. It'd be easier to use old content and make it more challenging. Some are crying for more trial content toward the relic grind. Again, I say why not? We're asking that the horizontal progression of the game be slightly modified to be interesting, right? It's not a huge request that we have the ability to move away from mindless grinding, whether it's end-game currency or relics. And these solutions aren't even really all that dangerous. As long as it doesn't break their established foundation. End game tomes wouldn't go anywhere. The mindless dungeon grind stays in tact. We just get interesting alternatives. 

Great to actually see another game designer up in here. I'm an artist, but I work with you fuckers all damn day. I've picked up a thing or two! Good stuff here. I'd like to see them think outside their WoW box a bit more when it comes to their path to ilevel cap. Rather, the options of which to take to said cap.",dezolis84,2018-03-14 01:44:56

After that show of spectacle with Shinryu vs. Omega, we ended up not seeing Shinryu again until the final boss fight of 4.0.  The Ruby Sea is by far my least favourite zone in the entire game, mainly due to the swimming.  A lot of the enemies you're supposed to farm for materials are spaced so far apart and the drop rate so low that it just doesn't seem worth it.  I'm especially looking at the Gyuki when I say this.

Hauke Manor Halloween showed us that they can do objective based content that can be randomized but still engaging - involving stealth mechanic.

Not so much now.

Its also a lot easier to look more favorably on those risks in hindsight, when in reality, they only look so good because we are contrasting it to the mire it pulled them out of.

Another part of the problem is about this game's identity. The issue is that this game billed itself, and fans word-of-mouthed it, was as a story driven MMO. ARR had story coming out of every orifice, to the point many complained there was too much fluff, filler story. And there probably was, similar to scenes in old tv shows that didn't yet have the writing down like today's productions. And so they'd be stuck with not enough time to introduce a new topic and flesh it out, so there'd be a 4 minute scene that literally did nothing. You could totally remove it and the plot is completely unchanged. And rightfully, players complained about this type of thing in ARR, and in HW they did a good job of dialing in the story. Yes, it was cliche at points. But it hit the appropriate fantasy marks, tugged on the correct heart strings, had some interesting new jobs, and concluded with a solid *probably* happy ending.

SB, I actually think was alright on the 4.0 release. You can't really judge it next to the entirety of HW. But there are issues. First off, the playerbase complaining about quests. And so what happens? We've received only around 20 MSQs in 2 subsequent patches, combined.

This is no longer the story driven MMO that it was originally marketed on. Its a dungeon crawl. And that's really bad, because battle gameplay is far from this game's strength, made worse by the fact that there is zero character customization in this game. This probably started to become apparent towards the end of the HW cycle. But it was somewhat masked by the initial SB story and the new zone progression. But we see now that they really have little else to offer here, as the majority of new content is just dungeon crawl or full party line dancing with props.

Its not just that its gotten complacent with SB, its that they gave up its very identity with SB.",ironmantis3,2018-03-14 08:31:09

Phew, was worried people were paying you to write statements like ""Ultimately, it's the game's death and rebirth that is the secret to its success, just as death and rebirth is the secret to anything (or anyone's) success"" for a second there!

The only risk ARR took was remaining a sub-based game. SE took a risk in a business sense by shutting down 1.0 and allowing Yoshida to do what he wanted to do with the game to the largest extent possible, but as a game itself XIV is nothing if not conservative.

Your post is more wordy and meandering than a fetch quest to find cheese when we should be fighting Titan. It would be far more interesting to read substantive analysis of XIV's game design from a game designer, rather than throwing out phrases like ""make it feel meaningful"" which is about as useful on a game design doc as ""make it good"".

More promises came in 3.0 and its following patch cycle. Things were getting better, and more importantly, there was a sense that it was going to get even better in the future.

I highly disagree with this, personally. 3.0 is really when the seams began to show and a lot of people began quitting the game in my own personal experience. Gordias was a mess, they had royally screwed crafting and gathering, and it was the first time we were getting a taste for the slow down in content (there was a MASSIVE lull after 3.0 released) as well as the lackluster job done balancing and designing the jobs (BRDs changes still stick out as a sore spot for a lot of people in 3.x).

2.x gets a pass since they were largely trying to patch together the mess that was 1.x. That stopped being the case once 3.0 hit and they had to show they could take risks and build their own game. They failed to do so, and are mostly *still* just trying to lug around the corpse that is 1.x, which is incredibly evident with all the limits that are imposed on them and the massive amounts of QoL fixes we're still getting to this day. Very likely because SE won't give FFXIV the resources it needs to fix it's issues at a steady pace, and is just being used as a cash cow at this point to keep SE alive (which is evident by all the cash shop additions that could have easily been actual rewards to sustain content, like the latest Hildebrand outfit).",SenaIkaza,2018-03-14 11:45:33

This was the case in XI, and in XIV it's still the case. I'm surprised so many MMO ""fans"" don't understand this simple concept. You're paying time for content, content that is stretched so far that it barely passes for fun.

Where the carrot comes in is the social aspects, the achievements, the ability to troll players, and the ability to use pure skill to overcome challenges for content in which that applies to.",sord_n_bored,2018-03-14 18:09:06

You can then further upgrade these various boons by killing the respected NM within that tier of elemental bosses series. For example: one boss could drop HP Boost Boon Level 1 (5%HP) then you kill higher tier to keep upgrading this to level 5 (15%HP) and further on to max at 25% HP boost. Another can give Defense Boost, Critical Hit Rate, etc... This way players can have up to three boons equipped, giving them ways to customize their load up - but still somewhat limited and not game breaking.

People who don't have time are forced to restrict themselves to a single job because the game is so stupidly obsessed with grinding like a mad man to get anything done.


I never understood that idea behind weekly cap, people who have lots of time will have the gear you're intentionally locking in little time wether you lock it or not, so why bother? instead of bloating the playtime by forcing people doing tedious tasks for a meagre stat increase, how about simply having another carrot to keep you interested in the game after getting your gear? how about for exemple giving the options to trade tokens for mats that are used in the new glamour items? (you'd need quite an amount of course otherwise you'd just remove any reason for crafter to sell those) or stuff like that, ofc that's just a basic idea.

I'm not saying it's the best way to deal with it but at least it's a start you can develop into something more interesting. Or maybe I don't know, make dungeons less repetitive and a bit more random to keep a minimum of entertainement? I doubt there are many who enjoy doing dungeons after 5 years of mindlessly repeating their rotation on monsters whose only real danger is if your healer falls asleep on you. 


They're so afraid of stepping out of their comfort zone that everything is starting to look the same, even Eureka which I enjoy for it's ideas is still the same basic zerging and the only way to actually make it somewhat novel is to try to solo it, I really had a hard time believing that THIS is what took 17 months to create. I mean the elemental wheel and the map I can understand, the former probably took a while to find the idea then develop it before coding it, the later is quite large and varied, but surely more could had been done in all that time, I'm no pro in coding but surely they could had done something like taking the levequest's system and tweak it to fit Eureka to give us side objectives or something.

Even if it differs from the FF14 classic formula. Pretty much ""reinventing the wheel"" but still stay within the core gameplay constraint.

As it is now - Eureka is Diadem 1.0 Dino Island - a bunch of people semi AFK waiting for the next NM announcement, then everyone go at it and kill them.

I've played since ARR Beta Phase 3, and personally i fell of the treadmill during the initial ARR end-game because my personal schedule would not allow me to join a static, and I really don't need the drama and stress that was inherent in that scene anyway.

So I became a much more casual player wandering around doing the things I want to just because I want to. Now that I completely overgear the ARR EX primals, I can do them and farm for ponies. There are a lot of things I do now that I would not do while they were stress filled grind fests. 

On the other hand, I have had several friends who inserted themselves into the raiding scene way back when and gradually they have become burned out and got bored and jaded. They would log in after each patch almost literally holding a to do list so they could burn through the new content in a day or two and go back to their routine of capping tomes each week. Ironically their play style became ever more defined by these things and ever more chore like, to where they felt that they had to do these things or fall behind the group. Eventually they burned out.

I found that their view of the game gradually became more and more jaded as their routine became so tightly focused on capping tomes as quickly as possible. In effect they had redefined the game into that tome capping only, everything else was seen as pointless because it couldn't help with that and was therefore a waste of time. It's no wonder they they became bored, burned out and jaded with the game, they unintentionally 'walled' themselves off from the majority of the game.

Some have left the game, some just hang on being jaded and bitter.  One of my friends who went through this realized too late that they'd done this to themself, and that being a filthy casual who just playes around the theme park was more enjoyable. It was too late because although they knew this, and recognized it openly, they were too far gone. They were scathing about the end-game and raiding communities that they'd been part of when they finally left the game.  

The lesson I take from these experiences is that people burn themselves out in this game and stop doing the broad range of content, they stop admiring a sunset, or the night sky, they stop enjoying the NPC banter and chatter, they see glamor as nothing but a distraction, their view of the game is filtered by end-game and progression.

Now, end-game content and progression is important, very important, but it's far from the only ting available and it's far from the majority of the content in the game.There is so much more to do, and that's not even including doing content with friends and chatting back and forth while you do it.

I wish that people would not become so narrowly focused, but having seen it happen so often I know that without ever intending to, many players focus too narrowly and eventually burn out.",Kosmos992k,2018-03-14 16:39:37

Ranger and Corsair were ""too expensive"" (You DPS with cheap stuff and weapinskill with the good stuff)

I mean, having to buy ammo at all made it more expensive. For a lot of players, making gil was a real problem. Just affording normal gear was hard for them, adding on constant ammo purchasing just made that worse. 

>  Also work pointing out WAR, PLD, MNK, DRG, SMN and BLM 

DRG was straight up GARBAGE until the 2H rework. I'm sorry, but it really was. Something like 10-15% of your total damage came from your wyvern, and it died so easily that you were just not worth bringing over any other DPS if you could avoid it. I lived that pain. 

Yeah, eventually they got Spirit Link buffs, Call Wyvern was moved to a more reasonable call time, and Spirit Surge was actually useful on HNMs for the def reduction on normal jump, as well as Angon merit giving them more def reduction as well. But for a pretty solid amount of time, DRG was trash. 

Depending on the context, some of those other classes could be seen as 'useless'. I'm not inviting a BLM to a TP burn. The PLD can come if they can sub NIN. PLD/NIN did pretty good damage to merit mobs. MNK was great in bones parties, and merit in general. At endgame they were situationally useful on cheesing some things with 2H, but most of the time you'd rather cheese those things with kclub DRK. On other things where you get swapped in for WS, they were -okay-. Could open Light or Dark, same as DRG. 

SMN was just a fundamentally broken class that got to play as a shitty white mage for the majority of their existence, but they had some good buffs for endgame. 

Just never let anyone know you had a BRD. You'll never be allowed to play your DRG again. Worst decision of my XI life. ",Ryuujinx,2018-03-14 03:52:01

FFXIV's battle system makes the process itself even more tedious that it sounds on paper thus anything that seems fun on paper will end up being not living up to it's hype. Griding exists in all mmo, doesn't mean it has to be barebone levels of boring.

Even as novel as the element wheel is, it's so barebonely implemented in game that it's little more than an idiot check as all you need to do is take a look at what monster is there and switch your wheel accordingly, but since all mobs are in pack of the same species and you have little reason to move you'll only touch it once, the presence of the turn value is completely irrelevent due to that.

Now, if for exemple the wheel had a more in depth system such as placing a magicite in a slot affects all stats instead of one like for exemple +25% on the slot itself, +10% on the adjacent slots, -25% on the opposing slot, -10% on it's adjacent slots  and have mixed packs of mobs with mixed elements you'd need to pay attention to the element of each monster because you're limited in the amount of times you can turn your wheel. 

Heck let's be crazy and lower the monster's stats a bit so that you can actually fight packs of them instead of 1v1 (and have them move as pack instead of individuals ofc), now you'll need to be even more careful with your wheel because you'll have to deal with that in real time instead of per mob basis.

Now it doesn't have to be exactly that but I assure you that entertaining content makes grind much more bearable if not enjoyable.",Phyllion,2018-03-14 05:53:05

Some players want to see horizontal gear progression with grindy means to obtain them. They want to be permanently rewarded for a grind that they did. When they become uber, they want to stay uber. 

It's hard for a returning player to want to resub, knowing that he's hundreds or maybe thousands of hours behind on some BiS loot grind that came out sometime when he wasn't playing.

WoW with Legion did somethings I really liked such as bringing the world to life outside of instanced content.  NPCs are active in those zones doing things like participating in battles / wars (unlike FFXIV where NPCs only spawn in certain fates to do events no one cares about story wise), and as WoW always does it kept raids sync'd with the story (like 2.0 did with coil).

The only reason I don't play WoW is two fold now...

* One, the game is bloated due to its age. It has become very difficult to navigate if you've taken an extended period of time off with all the systems in place and it makes it hard to figure out where to start back up / get caught up.

* Two, the combat of WoW is from an older era. FFXIV's combat with a longer GCD mixed with off GCD abilities feels more fluid and rewarding than WoW's mash the button style.

But in terms of which company takes more risks and does more with their game? Blizzard hands down. It shows with each xpac that they take a risk. Some are great (WOTLK / MOP / Legion), some are meh (BC), and some are terrible (Cata / WOD) but at least they mix it up which gives me faith that if I don't like it today, I may tomorrow and for a totally different reason then when I first started in vanilla which is good.

That's what I want out of FFXIV. I want reasons to enjoy it that didn't exist when 2.0 was a thing. The only difference for me has been story mode raids.

There are some really important innovations, though. To be brief, the salvaging of 1.0's crafting (for the most part) was one. Indicators for enemy attacks was a big one - and really the game's primary selling point. The way the game handled the narrative had some innovations throughout (for the genre more than the industry at large). In a more structural sense, though, the development pipeline allowed the team to release frequent and regular major updates unlike any other MMO on the market - even WoW. That led to all the innovations later on. The majority of game development is fairly invisible to fans, but we can get the sense of some amazing stuff happening behind the scenes with the FFXIV team and that's probably the main contributor to the level of dedication of its fanbase. So I'll defend the risks and innovations that started at 2.0 even if it is largely derivative of WoW. It stands out in the MMO market for sure, where innovation is generally pretty slow.

That being said, I do agree that the best innovation happend post-2.0. Personally, I find the 2.X - 3.X to be the game's strongest period (even though I personally couldn't stand 3.0 bard). A lot of 4.0's innovations happened day 1 and haven't really been added to in the 4.X series yet. I felt a significant improvement in class design, encounter design, and a streamlining of lots of little tertiary systems. Lots of good tweaks, but nothing to shake things up and keep players on their toes. The Omega raids are symbolic of this. They are extremely competent encounters using safe and familiar icons tied to proven reward systems that are all so calculated to push all the right buttons that's it's like a high quality massage chair. Satisfying, but mechanical and impersonal. As least from my unique perspective. From that point of view I kind of find the misstep of Eureka a breath of fresh air. This comes from being a designer in a field that you interact with. Sometimes interesting failures are more enjoyable to than bland successes. I can see what they are trying to do with Eureka and it's kind of interesting and that blemish makes FFXIV's otherwise polished surface a little more lovable. I just hope that this isn't a sign that they're already out of ideas given that I don't have any other big things to look forward to at the moment.

The main issue with that design philosophy is that classes can feel incomplete or even weak if you don't have the right legendaries. 

And then it raises balance concerns. Difficult content has to be designed around top-level gear, which means it's designed around having a good set of legendaries. So if you don't have those legendaries... tough luck.

FF14 takes the exact opposite approach, where items are literally just stat sticks. This makes it so that it isn't exciting to get new gear. ""Yay - this new weapon I got is 10 points stronger... how exciting!""

I think I do lean toward having unique effects on gear, though. Simply because it's more fun. RPGs are all about getting awesome loot. It's hard to get excited if the loot is just number upgrades.",yuriaoflondor,2018-03-14 01:20:36

As a fan of offline RPGs who was totally confused when coming to this game and all its unintuitive features, I'd love to see oldschool-RPG gear: weapons that damage certain kinds of monsters more; armor that defends some things better than others; weapons that increase spell speed versus others that slow down your spells but make them more powerful; weapons which do variable damage depending on how far you are from the enemies when you hit them; maybe armor that lets you move faster walking on the map.

At the very basic level, the content is **fine** as a barebones map. Which is my complaint. What they have is very simple and alone it is very safe to implement, and nothing innovative was done to amaze us. Eureka is a controlled environment and is easily the best place to hold a pseudo PTR for something like unique stats or materia with bonus effects. If that's too much, fine, add treasure maps for Eureka and add something gatherers can do. Maybe we try to rebuild the abandoned aetheryte areas and have crafters involved with setting up a fort by crafting, if no one can craft that's okay, you'll do something similar to what fates do by picking up logs from the nearby forest and turning them into a makeshift dam that's slightly less efficient. Then during the night some undeads will try to attack the makeshift base, prioritizing the walls you created while you fend them off.  

Right now the grind feels off for a variety of reasons, but for example when you level normally you get new skills to play around with while you grind. Or something like merit parties where you build up limit points and spend them enhancing your basic attributes or abilities. This....this is more akin to Natalan wolf parties from 1.0 except you're already max level. Diadem might have been a trainwreck, but it had some things I thought they did right that they completely removed in Diadem 3.0.  

I have played Eureka to Elvl 10 and the most interesting thing so far has been the different ways mobs behave around you and the day/night spawns. The NMs aren't complete pushovers so that's also nice. My opinion hasn't changed from my original post though.  

TL;DR They could have done a lot of cool things and my original post never meant Eureka is fine and doesn't need change. My post is that Eureka is fine for what it is but can be so much more.",nawga,2018-03-15 06:07:28

As far as the cap, it's more that people can't get so far ahead in a short amount of time. It helps keep the player base at least somewhat together in gear.

As for the job thing, yeah, that was my point. It's good to give people who want to play them all the option, but it'd be bad if they started designing content for people who have everything levelled and geared. I'd guess a significantly lower portion of the playerbase has a tons of 70s.

You get a set of level appropriate gear, but it isn't the end because you can swap that gear mid combat. Your set may be good enough to get started, but you can carry more situational gear.  So you have macros that switch gear to be optimal for a skill just before you use the skill.  Or you have idle sets that prioritize recovery and damage reduction stats rather than dealing damage so that you can limit danger between pulls. Or any number of other reasons.  Nearly every piece of gear has a use to someone at some point for some ability and even if it isn't the best item it is useful as a  stepping stone until you get the better more optimal one for a particular situation.  

The other thing I like is that the rewards from completing story missions or long chains like the relic remain useful or perhaps the best available.  Rajas ring from completing the second expansion is still one of the best rings in the game even though it is from something released 14 years ago and the level cap has gone up 25 levels since.  It makes accomplishments meaningful rather than wiping them out. Yes FFXI had a major gear reset with Abyssea and then a minor one with Adoulin (largely because you could upgrade your old gear from grind quests up to current level), but it was needed because to be perfectly honest there was really nothing left to add at level 75.  There was only so big a stat pool available before you stopped being able to make horizontal gear items and just had to make something 100% better.  ",Harieru,2018-03-14 09:35:49

Then SE can continue to release upgraded fights of Shiva with new and harder mechanics and with the older Shiva gearset, it will give you a leg up on clearing this fight because of the bonus stats against her.  Then every new Shiva fight can drop new augments or whatever to upgrade each individual piece of your gear and this can continue indefinitely and not feel stale fighting the same fight over and over.

No. Horizontal progression allows for the community to get even more elitistic and simply not allow you into a party unless you have *that* specific piece of gear, with *that* specific passive, because otherwise ""it's a waste of time, we can find someone else.""

You're talking about the community that pushed ""skip soar"" to its extreme limits and you want to *gate* gear behind horizontal progression? With all due respect, you're out of your mind.

Go try to be a part of a group in FFXI. Provided you can even stomach getting to cap lvl, try doing that for one (1) week. Just... ask around for a party to do endgame stuff with.

Go ahead and experience what horizontal progression *actually* does.

An horizontal progression system instead has different types of gear for different purposes. In XI for example you had equipment that was designed to enhance specific abilities either through stats or passives and you could swap your gear at any time to take advantage of this. This also created an inventory nightmare situation and the necessity for third party tools on PC because the game's UI was not designed to manage this system at all.,LilitthLu,2018-03-14 14:51:37

Horizontal Progression is when progress can be made in multiple directions so that a single job has multiple ways of expressing itself, responding to situations, and varying the gameplay experience. 

So, for example, you could use equipment that augmented abilities that fit with the situation, role, or desired gameplay by maximizing haste stat, focusing on att and/or acc, maximizing your TP accumulated on hit or trying to increase the % of times of your double attack or triple attack proc. Moreover, you'd want to macro in equipping certain pieces that augmented or enhanced abilities or spells for when you used them, but reequip your ""TP"" or ""Weapon Skill"" piece immediately afterward. 

In the end, this obviously requires more work from the player to be able to ""gear up"" for different situations or desired gameplay, but has the effect of making your gear feel special and more customizable (way less of a feeling of strickly being told by developers/creators that the latest highest iLVL piece is what you have to wear).

Very few MMO's actually succeed in horizontal progression from a statistic perspective because you have to allow for situations that are not as inclusive as the vertical ones where everyone at a certain progression point is viable for certain content.

Other examples of horizontal progression are the chasing of glamour items in FFXIV.  in GW2 it was somewhat like chasing different objectives that give you cooler looking gear that isn't better than the standard stuff but was flashier or making a gear set that allowed you to play at similar effectiveness but in a different style/spec.

Maybe a certain weapon will increase how frequently you attack, but this other weapon makes a particular weapon skill more effective?

Instead of focusing on simply increasing your stats to higher levels, you try and maximize your effectiveness and party synergy to clear difficult content. It also has the bonus of making gear stay relevant and valuable for MUCH longer.",[deleted],2018-03-14 15:45:01

Something that's i120 is worse than something that's i150, is worse than something that's i200, etc. So there isn't ever really a *choice* in what gear you're using, because for nearly all cases, there's a very clear superior choice. One exception is basically that the top tome-set of the previous expansion are going to be superior to the purchaseable sets / dungeon drops about 2/3 the way into the next expansion. The other exception is when you're in the most current raid tier, BiS isn't always the highest ilvl gear because of stat weights. For most people the stat weights provide a negligible difference, but sometimes when you're in a really high-class static, the extra Crit over Skill Speed provides the difference between passing an Ultimate Coil DPS check and failing it.

In Horizontal progression, there isn't as clear a direct lineage of gear. Something that's i200 might dwarf something that's i250 depending on the content. An example would be if the old Element system was in play (sort of like it is in Eureka), where armor that provides you Fire Resist might be more advantageous going into Ifrit than armor which just has outright higher defense. The idea behind horizontal progression is that there are options for players to take, in order to minimize/maximize their abilities for content. This doesn't necessarily mean exclusively for gear either. In games like *Diablo,* you're allowed to choose the skills you get as you level up, as skill trees. Rather than only choosing Role Skills like you do in FFXIV, you're basically choosing one of several builds for a job, where unlocking certain skills is dependent on you having already unlocked others, and some skills are mutually exclusive.

Horizontal Progression would mean that the drops from Ifrit or Shiva might still be relevant today, because they might give us abilities or skills or resistances that would qualify them over other drops in certain pieces of content. If you got a blade from Garuda that was +10 Wind Damage on every Auto-Attack, for example, then that sort of thing would help you against fire-based mobs. If you got a weapon from Temple of the Fist that enables anyone using it to use the skill Brotherhood, then equipping it to non-Monks might become a viable strategy in certain raids over just using the highest damage weapon.",shinginta,2018-03-14 17:22:22

We currently have a heavy favor towards vertical progressions; moving up ilvls each patch. While there is very little horizontal at the moment; choosing the i300 head with crit/det vs the i300 head with dh/spd.

horizontal is usually, but not necessarily, about customizing your character to your playstyle while maintaining a level of power equal to other people. So you might focus on improving a specific ability, while another might go for a more general boost all abilities to a lesser amount. but both of you remain at the same overall power level. 

Sometimes its also about making specific things easier with specific gear just for those places. WoW did this early on (haven't played in forever not sure if they still do) with making elemental resistence really matter. If you went out and got a good set of fire resistance gear then molten core would be a lot easier than thsoe who didn't get this gear. but this gear wasn't more powerful than other gear it was just good for this one specific place.

My anecdotal experience with people wanting to come back and catch up is the opposite, though.

It's also okay if they do content for people who have a couple jobs at max if they don't make it the requirement for everything but rather something on the side to reward you for your time invested. (Also there's probably a number of people that don't bother leveling jobs because they know they'll have to grind for the job THEN the gear with those tedious lockouts, there's a reason why so many jump class at the start of an expansion, it's cause it's new and starts not too far from where you are so it doesn't take too long to catch up)

So yeah, it'll be different. I don't think we'll be seeing many of those posts about people 'completing all the relics' for SB. You would have to be a masochist to go back there when it'll be completely empty, doing fully synced content the whole way.",Yashimata,2018-03-14 02:19:34

So frequent rewards coupled with a way to grind through all your other classes was good content to make that grind less grindy.

Honestly, the fate and dungeon farming for the ARR and HW relics served the extra purposes in getting experienced players in lower level areas so that new players had help in exp providing events and a reduction in queue times for content players needed to clear.  The grind served a greater purpose.

Eureka is a level 70 grind for the sake of being a level 70 grind.  It doesn't help non-70 players, it doesn't open up being able to level other classes in yet another separate leveling system, it doesn't provide content outside of just kill mobs.

Not exactly loot, but SMNs were an example. Remember Avatar showcasing? Which really only means it's still horizontal progression. 

Only, instead of there being 1 horizontal progression, there were many, all of which locked behind extremely hard grinding and/or botting and/or being filthy rich and just buying some of the stuff you need (or that was buyable anyway lol).

I was thinking of something along the lines of Dungeon Fighter Online, if you've heard of that. In that game, there's several sets of end-game gear you can get, and each one affects your character in vastly different ways. There's one set that lowers the cooldowns of your moves drastically (but you use MP much faster). There's also one that procs a ton of other effects to happen whenever you hit enemies, causing all sorts of crazy AoEs popping up all over the place as you fight. The set you happen to get at the end of the game (all through sheer luck, of course) decides how you play your character until you get the next, much better set.

It's not a perfect system by any means, but it's definitely fun to try different sets if you get lucky enough. Stupid drop RNG... haha xD

EDIT: That does seem really neat though. Having items stay relevant for really long periods of time is cool. In FFXIV, they could've done something like gear with horizontal progression in Eureka, but have the effects only work in that area.

Umm... I didn't imply *any* of what you're saying. I can only assume from all of the italics that this hit some sort of soft spot. I'm sorry you've had such a bad experience.

First off, to give my point of view, I've come from games like Dungeon Fighter Online and PSO2 which *do* have some horizontal progression as far as skill trees and gear. Of course, both games have an optimal route to pick which was decided by the majority of the playerbase, but both games still give you several options to choose from *and* both games are very successful. I've played quite a bit of DFO and for end-game content, certain gear sets are preferred, but most are passable and can still get you in a group. I'm not saying to do things like FFXI did, which I'm assuming wasn't very good judging by your response, I'm saying that having some semblance of choice increases the complexity in building your character and adds a bit of diversity. Even if everyone ends up in the same place at the end, the journey for everyone was different.

FFXIV is the only MMO I've played that's literally given the player no choice in how they build their character (apart from looks and... 30 stat points). If you're a WHM, you HAVE to do these things and get these things. If you're a BLM, you HAVE to do those things and get those things. Everyone's journey is exactly the same. There's no room for creativity. Your rotation has to be this, otherwise you're crap. I feel like this actually increases the elitism, because now it's about how you play your class, or, in some cases, if your class is even viable, rather than what you're wearing. There are people in FFXIV that have spent their entire time playing their favorite class, yet can't join in end-game content, because*nobody wants that class*. Don't you think that's a little worse?? In DFO, any class can be good with a good gear set, and all of them are accepted regardless of who they are. That's what I mean. If FFXI failed in this aspect, maybe SE just doesn't know how to do proper horizontal progression.",KingofDefeat,2018-03-14 14:58:23

You're right in that the gear lockout doesn't stop the edge players from progressing and such, and it is an annoyance coming from that perspective. 

And I also agree with your point about how they should make content that is available after the gear, instead of the other way around, too. Unfortunately, right now gear is the only reward offered for content, aside from just the thrill of clearing content itself.

And the job thing I more or less agree with too. I think it'd be nice to allow people with jobs levelled to swap on the fly. Hell, I'd love to swap which tank I'm using in dungeons for boss fights vs trash mobs. Itd be lovely. I just don't think making content centered on job flipping would be well received by the general player base (though, to be fair, I could be wrong on that.)

Now, as for the lock out thing. I'm kinda half in favor of it and half not. Like I said, I agree with you for the most part. It's mostly an annoyance for those who have the time to invest immediately to progress. (Though then the lack of content after the gear grind becomes what people complain about, which is a whole other issue). Back in college I had time to play constantly and yeah, I remember getting mad at the cap.

Now though, I have a full time job and significantly less time to play. Capping each week becomes an easy goal. Hell, I'm at work now but when I get home after my shift I'm going to run expert after a shower so I can get my roulette for the day. It's a simple and easy thing for people with quite literally zero time to shoot for. So, in some respects, I understand and actually like having the cap. It puts a solid top on what I can do each week in addition to getting my Savage chests and pages.

So...yeah. I dunno, I'm actually kinda torn on it and easily see both sides of the coin. It's just nice knowing that, as someone who doesn't have a ton of time, that I'm not going to be blown away by players with a ton of time immediately on ilvl. I mean, I realize that some people have gotten or are on their way to Savage sets, but that requires skill and effort, not just time. And I'm ok with that.

But if some players could have a full set of tomestone gear day one just because they can sit there and play would be a little deafeating. So...yeah. Now I'm just blathering on. Sorry.",Azyryu,2018-03-14 05:55:17

Some people use windower to run scripts for it or gearswap add-on, which were third party, but you could also do it with the regular macros that we're limited in how many lines they could have.  They have since changed how swapping works and you can make a gear set and it takes 1 line for the whole set rather than a line per piece.

The fun of it was getting an item and figuring it into your sets to optimize things  and being able to squeeze out a little more DPS or another heal etc.

I've played FFXI since it's release (and, yes, I still pay my subscription at the very moment lol--even if I don't log in every day) and (1) it's true that the gear grinds could be the definition of defeating and discouraging, but (2) they did succeed in creating gear stat system that made gear infinitely more interesting and desirable than every MMO since them that I've seen. (1) is an issue of progression, not stat mechancis (i.e., triple attack, occ. attacks multiple times, augments ability to [yada yada]). 

It's an amazing feat to have a pair of level 7 boots and a level 24 headpiece remain relevant for nearly 50 levels beyond its level. There's something nostalgically enticing about the grinds for Lizzy and the Emperor, but I won't pretend like I was overcome with excitement WHILE I was actually sitting there kicking sand waiting for the fuckers to spawn only for a chance to see the drop. As such, developers need to look back at the last near-2 decades of MMOs and reimagine more engaging ways to implement that grind, but simultaneously recognize that the gear systems outside horizontal progression are literally pieces of poop shat by an animal decaying on the ground with life expectancies of < the remaining fucks many of us have in our inventory space. 

It's not the gear that keeps us grinding EX, savage, relics, etc., but the cosmetics, the fights, and a fool's hope lol. But could you imagine getting gear that upgraded it's iLVL (rather than tossing for new gear) every patch that actually augmented your oGCD abilities, occasionally added extra auto attacks or multiplied GCD potency. There's so many ways relic gear could be used to diversify and enrich the fighting and theorycrafting, but they do seem to be afraid of two things: (1) making non-raid content rewarding (like you mentioned) and (2) imbalances even for a moment.

That said, that issue could easily be fixed with more options to gear up, for exemple something similar to 24 man; those who have lots of time could just gear up farming like crazy, while those who don't could do some content that gives one piece every whatever amount of time the devs see fit so that you will gear up slower than them, that's only natural, but it wont take you years either.

Another option is simply increase the amount of token given by the daily roulettes, those who grind like crazy will still get their stuff in no time, those with less time will enjoy the sweet sweet bonus and can even take the luxury to spend their time doing something else :p

I'm all for having more interesting gear, but I feel you should at least have to commit to that modified playstyle and/or set of bonuses for an entire fight.

A large portion of people that play this game eat up all of the collectible crap SE throws at them and are willing to pay large portions of their money and time into getting this stuff. This could be where FFXIV makes most of its money, because it's always the part of the game that's focused on the most. At every big event, it never fails that whenever the audience is given the chance to ask questions, they'll ask about mounts, minions, and housing stuff. This game has the highest amount of pointless collectibles I've ever seen in any MMO (aside from outfits... lots of games do that).

What urks me the most, is that even my friends that I play this game with just absolutely love all of this stuff and will defend SE to the grave, despite knowing many, many important aspects of FFXIV are seriously flawed. Their slow update cycle, their so-called ""events"" that are just ""talk to person, get item"" quests that you do once and forget, constant repetitive content that follows the same tired formula since day one... I dunno... it's honestly getting to be a little too much for me... ><

I want the game to be good, because it has its moments in raid content, primal battles, and other similar content, but it's hard to deal with getting quite literally no interesting content every 2 months.

I also want the gearing to take a little while. When everyone is geared, the newest content (like Savage) gets easier. By a significant margin.

I like the challenge that's offered before things get easier. So, the general populace taking a while to get over geared for the content means there's a few weeks of throwing yourself against an actually difficult bit of content for a bit.

I also realize I'm probably in the minority here, but I love the first few weeks after new content drops when it's hard to get through and there's a lot of wiping. That's fun for me. So the longer people take to gear, the more time we get at min ilvls for content.

Don't let the opinions of players who've been playing the game for a while ruin your experience, especially if you're having fun.

We're just upset, because SE doesn't really take risks with the game, making new content seem stale. The crap I'm saying is coming from someone who only does the story and the battle content. FFXIV's crafting is pretty extensive if you're into that, and like I said in my post, there are tons of collectibles and achievements you can get as well. The game is really for people who just love doing everything a game has to offer. Since I only play the parts of the game that I like, I only get part of the experience, which increases my disdain for it.

Another thing is Japan is more global with brands like Shiseido, Shu Uemura, Suqqu, Koh Gen Do etc available everywhere and in big department stores, while the same can't be said about Korean brands.

RMK and Suqqu are other ones, I have family members who are really into both.  

I use Koh Gen Do and ettusais for base products, both are Japanese.  I also use Chantecaille Just Skin which is a tinted moisturizer made in Japan.

>MHJ‚Äôs agitation is reminiscent of certain types of politicians who are gaining traction today: those who claim to represent the grassroots, the ‚Äòcommon man,‚Äô while stirring hostility towards the elite. A by-the-books populist tactic. They ride the wave of social conflict, stoking people‚Äôs anger and then presenting targets for that anger.

Exactly. I had mentioned in one of the earlier megathreads how MHJ's tactics reminded me of how Donald Trump, an Ivy League graduate who was born into the New York elite, had weaponized white working class rage against the system... despite being a part of that very system himself.

This is also a good reminder that just because criticism is coming from Koreans, that doesn't mean it is necessarily valid. Yes, they don't need translations and they're far more attuned to what's going in their own country, but that doesn't mean they aren't susceptible to bias or misinformation.

Keep in mind that Tablo and Epik High's career was almost completely destroyed by a wild hate train fueled by patently false allegations of academic fraud. A wild hate train which was driven entirely by Koreans and continued even when the allegations were disproven.

At the end of the day, Koreans are just people. They just happen to live in Korea, that's all.",healthyscalpsforall,2024-05-20 12:34:55

The article is right: South Korea is indeed vulnerable to the rise of a Trump-like character coming to power. The MHJ phenomenon really made that apparent to me. American kpop fans picked up on the similarities between those two right away. It‚Äôs somewhat concerning because it‚Äôs the progressive side of Korean politics that sided with MHJ, whereas in the US progressives were the camp that continually fought against the orange man. I hope Korean civil society is up for the challenge if they see that rise.  

The feminist icon being applied to MHJ is the most disgustingly aspect to this.  The hate she directed to Illit and LSF members was disgusting.  She knew the power of her words. As it was happening and continues to happen, she never said a word to stop it.  What she said about the female employee shows how she doesn‚Äôt care about other women.  She‚Äôs no feminist icon.  

I just want Hybe to fire her and get her away from my favs. If some other company wants to hire her, that‚Äôs on them.  Hybe was already stupid for doing so.  The money she brought in is no where close to compensating for what Hybe is going through currently.",Bear4years,2024-05-20 15:16:11

I was right!"" moment. MHJ is probably playing a lot on those feelings too. 

It's also super easy for her to frame herself as a lone hero against an evil capitalistic company who wants to steal her job, replicate it and eventually eliminate her completely.

MHJ represents the half-4ssed society we live in, on one side we fill out mouths with words about equality for women, but on the other side we only want ""safe"" women that carry on the same old values imposed by men, women that want to change the system don't have a chance.

This part reallt got to me because its exactly how I felt seeing her and seeing people not even paying attention to the other things being said. Because I have seen first hand this type of politician becoming president with people going: oh but he is so sincere, he is honest and authentic. with no regard if its true or not. 

I've always liked NewJeans (I even have their bag here lol) but have to own up to being biased against MHJ because of Cookie and her dismissive nature and the clear outrage marketing she used with them. You could say I liked newjeans despite of her. The minute the audit was announced her first statement was directly comming for ILLIT, and we know who gets the hate online. That move was something that just put a bad taste in my mouth and I have to own up to being kind of against her from the start because of it. But that didnt stop me from supporting the newjeans members, I wish them well.

MHJ is extremely skilled at marketing (and at doing so in ways I would argue are unethical). I especially appreciate you pointing out how ""her story is filled with elements that progressive media find compelling,"" because that has been a frustrating point for me.

The go-to response of people defending MHJ isn't a refutation of facts/allegations but instead accusations of being a ""corporate bootlicker"" or ""Hybe stan."" And while I believe hatred of corporations is more than justified and that corporations, including Hybe, are ultimately bad for art (I do think Hybe has a ""style"" for their girl groups that does follow after NJ's success, and I don't personally find it appealing), it also neglects a key fact: that corporations are comprised of people.

Now, corporations also forget that. All the time. For example, it's telling to me that Hybe didn't intervene to protect its artists after any of the other scandals like ""Cookie,"" but only when Hybe's profits were threatened via MHJ's plotted coup.

But at the same time, in this case, it's not so simple as ""both suck"" either. If MHJ did what they allege, it'd be harming not just the big-wig rich guys, but also the smaller people who are just scraping by on a salary. In fact, before the bosses take paycuts, the smaller people would be fired. Even if you believed she was a small girl taking on a big corporation, it's not a zero-harm situation.

A lot of progressive sites seem to be well-meaning but oversimplify by making it a human vs nonhuman situation, when that's not actually what the situation is. And that isn't to say that you shouldn't stand up to big corporations even at the risk of others getting hurt at various times. You should. But you gotta acknowledge teh complexity here.

And then in this particular case it is so obvious that MHJ isn't standing up to Big Corp for the principle of it, but instead for her own prestige and success. Those texts were released deliberately to show just how fake her maternal, small girl, and feminist image was, but the facts are that those texts exist and there's no context under which most of those texts are acceptable.

So basically, Hybe can suck as corporations do, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't be in a ""business right"" situation here, or that MHJ and Hybe are even ethically equally wrong when it comes to this.",lilysjasmine92,2024-05-20 21:33:06

Definitely provided a detailed explanation of why a lot of Koreans are siding with Min Heejin in her current dispute with HYBE.

I will add insights from my personal experiences: Min Heejin has been very popular among the Korean public for over a decade. Most Koreans I have met (and talked K-Pop with) have always spoken highly of MHJ. The reasons are her ‚Äúcreative genius‚Äù and wide range of concepts over the years. I am on the older side of K-Pop fans now, so I‚Äôve spoken to people that grew up listening to the likes of SNSD, SHINee, f(x), etc. I can say Koreans have always had a really favorable view of MHJ.

I‚Äôm going to be honest with you, I have actually never heard anything negative from Koreans regarding MHJ. In fact, all the ‚Äúgrooming‚Äù and similar allegations on MHJ I‚Äôve read over the years have always come from Western K-Pop fans. I guess this is another scenario in which Koreans usually see or analyze things differently from Western K-Pop fans. 

With this, I am not trying to excuse any past behaviors from MHJ. What I want to illustrate is that MHJ has been loved by Koreans for as long as I can remember, which is why I am not surprised to see most people siding with her against HYBE. And once again, these are insights from my personal experiences, I do not speak for everyone.",KyeodeurangiMerchant,2024-05-20 20:07:30

Like as soon as I heard this is the press con, I could see she‚Äôs trying to use Sakura and get all those nationalist and xenophobic people to hate her.

It is just more narrative forming:

*The enlightened journalist bemoans the naivety and stupidity of the masses, who of course are always manipulated and cannot come to reasoned conclusions. The foolish mob can't hope to understand complexities like the journalist can, and so they easily fall under the sway of a villain (or in this case, villianess).*

Note that in this narrative, the good vs. evil dynamic is cleverly maintained:

*MHJ is the evil witch who has captivated the silly, uneducated peasants and turned them against their, admittedly flawed, but ultimately good, king (the industry). She has also cast an enchantment over the naive young ladies of the court (New Jeans) and seduced them away from the protection of their, again flawed but ultimately noble, father (Hybe).*

It‚Äôs fascinating and a really great read. Seriously appreciate it.

To echo a lot of the other commenters (and I am NOT a big hybe fan), I saw through MHJ‚Äôs BS the second all of this started coming out. I didn‚Äôt understand why people were eating up her words when she‚Äôs a Gen X millionaire that makes money off of marketing young girls and boys to older men in a very‚Ä¶ specific way. Definitely not a lowly worker trying to get by. Again, no way saying Hybe is 100% innocent, but this issue has gotten so much bigger just because she‚Äôs dragged in other literal CHILDREN and young women into this conflict.

I definitely was confused when her press conference seemed to turn public opinion. This article, along with a lot of other folks explaining why it turned public opinion, has really been eye-opening. I initially couldn‚Äôt tell if it was my own bias‚Äô speaking ‚ÄîI have purposefully distanced myself from NewJeans even from their debut as the way MHJ capitalizes on their age and pushes an ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô persona has always kind of grossed me out. I also didn‚Äôt like her from even before NJ debuted, lol. (Before anyone comes for me: I know MHJ is not the only one in the industry who does this.) 

I think Hybe fumbled on hiring her in the first place, and that‚Äôs what kind of gets to me about this situation too, and why I think Hybe (specifically BPD) are still at fault. She‚Äôs a marketing genius ‚Äî and I truly, truly do believe that ‚Äî but it‚Äôs clearly at the expense of the minors she manipulates and the employees she abuses.

Feminism and the youth of Korea have it far, far worse than their older male counterparts, who are sitting cozy in the system made for them (in comparison). Then there's this kind of story, about IDOLs, involving what was once MY safe space to relax? And the camel's back breaks.

But to give grace to them, crowdthink is a terrifying thing and it robs the individual within a crowd of their reasoning.

The amount of love the general public has for NewJeans is almost unprecedented. And it's not just that, but because of their young age and concept of 'just teens making the most of their childhood', many people feel very protective towards NewJeans.

Just as an example, there's a little joke in Korean where people say, ""<blank>Îäî Í±¥Îì§ÏßÄ ÎßàÎùº"" or ""Don't touch <blank>."" It's mostly light-hearted and is used when someone is teasing a well-loved thing. In the kpop space, you might see it in the comments of any singing show where someone covers a difficult-to-reinterpret song. For example, in [Sing Again 3](https://youtu.be/p2lCK5zVPKM?si=cp3DHj8MoI_ND6A3), when this contestant says he'll be covering NewJeans' Hype Boy, the response by one of the judge's Code Kunst (who's much more in the RnB and khiphop scene) jokes and says, ""Don't touch NewJeans!"" I've only heard that for legendary artists like B.E.G, IU, BTS, etc. Mans killed it btw, have a listen.

There's a reason why MHJ made a big show to try and align herself with NewJeans as much as possible (and is still doing so), because she knows that any entity that is labeled as an 'enemy of NewJeans' is sure to have hordes of defenders for them.",FullofSeoul,2024-05-20 18:50:03

You're right that it's always important to consider whether or not something is arguing in good faith or just countering with their own narrative.

But not everything is just storytelling, and not all ""narratives"" are inherently false. Just ones that try and divide a complex issue into a simple, good vs evil. You might point out a different interpretation of the good vs. evil narrative, by saying 'the masses are naive and stupid' and that HYBE is the 'flawed but noble' father, but both are untrue too.

HYBE has many flaws, and like I mentioned, may well be guilty of the things MHJ is accusing them of. That does not change the fact that her arguments center around accusing HYBE of other things and does not directly address the core issue of embezzlement and hostile takeover of management. She can go ahead and attack HYBE as much as she wants, so long as she can directly respond to and deny the allegations levied against her. But she hasn't.

And I'm not sure you really understood the article, or just feel called out as being part of the masses, but not once does this article blame the public. As many people as there are that loudly support MHJ, there are equally as many people either checked out from the conversation or staying neutral or making their own ""reasoned conclusions."" This article just focuses on how certain populations may be more susceptible to her rhetoric.",FullofSeoul,2024-05-20 14:25:33

I can't deny that this article is biased against MHJ, but I also don't really think it's a corporate attack. Like I mentioned, the core of this dispute is whether HYBE is allowed to fire MHJ.

Both sides are certainly no angels and HYBE has a lot of things to be rightfully criticized for. Things that MHJ does bring up. But just because HYBE are pieces of shit doesn't mean that MHJ can't be fired.

And to be completely honest, this article isn't even about that specifically. It's about how MHJ did not talk about her embezzlement or the attempted takeover of management rights, but focused on separate issues. Honestly, she's yet to adequately address any of the things she's been accused of. 

And lastly, Hybe telling MHJ if NJ can step on Aespa is just proving my point, no? SHE brought it up in a press conference that's meant to defend her position. Even if BSH is a dumbass that's saying he wants to stomp his competition, what does that have to do with MHJ wanting to (allegedly) tank ADOR's stock to try and attempt a separate buyout? 

Don't get me wrong, it's a horrible thing to say, but it doesn't address any of HYBE's accusations, brings AESPA into the conversation unnecessarily, and puts a target on BSH's head. Same thing with his ""are you happy lol"" text that she released. It's meant to garner a visceral, 'ew,' from onlookers and distract them from the corporate malfeasance.",FullofSeoul,2024-05-20 17:46:51

To piggyback on your point about the digital narrativization of reality,  now and then there are even moments when I feel like I was riled up online and I had to pause and asked myself why and dug deeper. Not a very comfortable or flattering admission but 9 times out of 10 it basically always goes back to some existing societal or systemic issue that nobody can change in a snap of your fingers so it ends up being projected outward. At least we can try to recognize it and not use it as a fuel for hate.

I saw you mentioned Tablo somewhere and I actually was thinking about him too. I listened to the TaJinYo podcast recently and the part that stood out to me the most is when Tablo started fighting back on his anon antis, one of them turned out to be a stressed out teenager whose dad personally came to apologize and begged him to drop her lawsuit, which he did. 

So yeah, in many ways I understand and empathize with MHJ‚Äôs feminist supporters and even wondering would I react similarly if I was in their shoes. But on the other hand, I guess you can say I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in the U.S. so I‚Äôve seen this kind of story replaying itself multiple times lol.

Yes that was one of my comments. I'm glad it helped inspire this much more in-depth post!

I was specifically reminded of Trump not just because of the similar playbook, but just how transparently empty it was. Like there was no way I was buying Donald Trump as this anti-establishment hero, just like I can't buy MHJ as this feminist icon. 

So it was kind of maddening to see it work on so many people. I don't know, I just saw through their tactics because it never seemed credible to me. 

Then again I've seen this playbook so many times, it's so old... I saw it during Brexit, I saw it during many European elections, I saw George W. Bush use it, I look back at history and I see Hitler using it... It always disappoints me when people fall for it

They start ingraining this when they're really young, to the point that one mother said she had to take her 4 yr old out of a school and put him in a more lenient one because he was showing signs of burnout. 

A FOUR yr old was showing signs of burnout.... 

He was so depressed that he couldn't muster the energy to draw like he used to, and ended up thanking his mother to no end for ""saving"" him from the intensive school she took him out of.

Meanwhile, they move onto talking to some of the other others who laugh off any claims that the amount of studying is too hard on the kids by saying,""It's not like they're going to DIE from it."" They all continue laughing as if that's nonsense. One mother says she wants her son to get the best grades, to be well liked, and grow to 6 ft tall, except she's not laughing about any of this, she's dead serious. In my head I'm thinking,""How can he socialize when he spends his whole time studying??""

It's a rehash of an ancient argument: 

*The masses are sheep, and the shepherds, while flawed, are still better than the big bad wolf.*

Everytime someone, anyone, challenges an existing power structure, or is in the way of an existing power structure, this same argument will be trotted out to explain why they appeal to ""certain populations"" of the general public. These arguments and examinations are not novel. 

*X is a bad guy. Sure, Y might be flawed, but X is not the answer. X is only taking advantage of admittedly real injustices and problems. In reality, X is just a cynical actor who is only self-interested.* 

This can obviously be accurately applied to many historical and current figures. It can also be inaccurately applied to historical and current figures.  But it will *always* be applied to anyone who confronts an existing power structure. 

As for this particular case, you've made the argument that Hybe should be allowed to release irrelevent and personally damaging information on MHJ, but she should limit herself only to responding to the impersonal and legal accusations. 

This is, of course, a rather hypocritical standard. It is also ironic, because MHJ the individual is being asked for perfect professionalism, while Hybe the corporation is free to act unprofessionaly. 

Ideally, both Hybe and MHJ would limit themselves to the legal question. A legal question that Hybe, being the accuser should have to prove, while MHJ being the accused should enjoy an assumption of innocence until said accusations are proven. 

But things are never black and white, are they? 

So of course Hybe, perhaps feeling unconfident in their ability to prove the charges, will muddy the waters by attacking her reputation. 

And of course MHJ, perhaps feeling unconfident in her ability to defend herself from the charges, will respond by further muddying the waters by attacking their reputation. 

Who is more in the wrong here? I don't know. They are both doing bad things, but those bad things are also very understandable. I do know that Hybe, as of yet, has not proven their legal case. That doesn't mean it can't be proven, but it does mean they haven't *yet* satisfied their obligation as the accuser. 

One thing we can be sure about though, is that MHJ, innocent or guilty, rightly or wrongly, has become the target of destruction by a corporate entity that is far more powerful than her.",StevenJosephRomo,2024-05-20 16:27:56

That's already baked in. The industry is already an existing power structure, and it has assumed legitimacy. 

No one has to explicitly say the industry is ultimately good. The industry is ultimately good because the industry exists and functions. That's how social institutions work. They are presumed valid and legitimate unless proven otherwise. They don't require activism to continue, they do that by inertia. In fact, activism is required to stop them or change them, not to maintain them. The object in motion remains in motion. 

Hybe may be bad, they may be guilty, and we all may hate them. But when Hybe, a member of the industry, raises a claim against an individual, that individual is expected to respond in a calm, sober, professional manner and to limit themselves only to the matter at hand. 

That is how we treated kings in courts of nobility in the past, and that is how we treat judges in courts of law in the present. 

And notice, that is exactly how the writer of the article expects Min HeeJin to respond. She is not allowed to show emotional distress, to present herself in casual dress, to use casual language, or to bring up other, unconnected injuries and insults to herself. 

Because she did engage in those behaviors when dealing with Hybe, those behaviors were presented as dangerous to the social order and adjacent to right-wing anarchist extremism. Because Hybe is a member of the institution, and institutions demand respect.",StevenJosephRomo,2024-05-20 18:10:18

I also plan to keep all the casing of my cushions (after removing the foundation sponge inside and cleaned out) and plan to reuse them. I think the longevity of a cushion also depends on how/where users store & use the cushion, plus how often they wash the puff. And also it's just a bit of random luck or bad luck. Like for example, people swear up and down that their fav brand of makeup sponge will. not. grow. mold but I've seen first hand that it... depends. I mean picking a sunny and well-ventilated spot to store it really helps, but humid weather are just the fact of life, while mold and fungus spores are so small and it only takes a couple of them to take root and the sponge is a goner. I've seen *many* people use their cushion until the inside sponge completely dries out *without ever* washing their cushion puff that they use day in, day out to apply the cushion, to both clean face and a sweaty, dirty face with zero problem, and this is the majority of normal people btw. No shame, if it works for them, it works - cushions are also formulated with enough preservatives to prevent this (this is why fuck the vegan/no paraben/fear monger bullshit). Some people wash puffs after every use, some after 1-2 weeks. I have experienced breakout when used an used sponge tip (it was only used once), so I'm a wash after every use person. I get multiple cushion puffs so I can just toss one by the sink after each use, to wash them all at the end of the week. It seems like a chore but they wash pretty easily and dry very fast. I strap them onto lipsticks that can stand up by themselves so they dry even faster. Also use alcohol to wipe the little lid where the puff is stored and the mirror in the cushion - since I don't store used puffs there I can skip this step. There are also guides on this sub to thoroughly wash your puffs without destroying them, you can search them out.",properly_pissed,2022-10-17 13:23:06

Since then, I‚Äôve made sure to have 2‚Äì3 puffs on rotation depending on how often I‚Äôm using them, and I also prefer puffs with a light color on the side that touches your face so that I can actually see the mold, if it starts growing. [ETA that I also replace the puff if I even kind of think I should, so I try to keep spares on hand.]

As for the cushion itself, I just keep using it until the product is gone, but I do make sure to look out for any changes. [And ETA again that if it‚Äôs a Korean product, it should have a PAO indicated somewhere, so you could also refer to that, too.]",marcelavy,2022-10-18 08:46:39

They have procedures in place for uncommon situations, even if they have something in place to notice an event, they still will go do a redundant check of things.
They also are willing to entertain information from other people that counters the knowledge they think they have, but only so far as to verify if the new information is correct until the other person is shown to be correct.
They also have measures in place to signal when they are out of their depth, and to analyze their own equipment for anomalies.

It is such a genre trope to have the persons in the alternate world be such buffoons so to make the protagonist look that much better. It is nice to see characters operate in the world they are in smartly.",Vambann,2024-03-26 19:01:12

Level 10 is just one level higher than they've already reached equilibrium with.  That's what makes it noticeable; presumably they just moved *out* of a Level 9 area.  Another few levels is required for Carlos to achieve 100% synergy whatsit, which will presumably trigger the start of the ""second stage"", whatever that is.

Fenty has a very extensive shade range (they have all 40 shades here in Korea) so they must have your color.
You could also try Espoir, they seem to have a lot of variety in shades (not cushions, only foundations tho).
