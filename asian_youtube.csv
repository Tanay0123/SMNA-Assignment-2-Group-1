There are no shades for medium-dark tones and most shades don’t have good undertones so only a select amount of people can use them even with 30 shades. There aren’t shades for people who aren’t very dark or light tanned to pale. The oxidisation is horrible and you have no cool shades for “medium dark” so when it oxidises, it goes orange. This still isn’t a good shade range when it’s either pale shades, light medium shades or 3-4 very dark shades. That’s not shade range, that’s just lots of different foundations that could fit certain people, like 2-3 shades in each range is the same and fits a bunch of people. This is what I noticed when I bought the testers and tried different shades (regrettably) such a shame because the formula is really nice.",23800,9086601,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

If it&#39;s a korean brand then their focus is korean customers who very rarely have dark shade. Even in stores it&#39;s rare to find a dark shade product. It&#39;s not because they think dark skin people don&#39;t have shades it&#39;s because they don&#39;t wanna risk producing dark shade product and then  those products not being sold. But later when their brand value increases and people demand more shades then they can release the risky shades. Perfect example tir tir. They didn&#39;t have many shades before but people absolutely loved them and people demanded more so they gave more.,3520000,1734939401,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

Thankfully, growing up in an American country, I have many options for me when it comes to shade, but not to undertone! Also, in Brazil there aren’t many cushion brands (it’s usually more tinted spf, Bb creams and so on)…<br>Can anyone recommend me a cushion suitable for a girl who wears Missha’s Bb Cream in the shade 25??

Koreans are really big on Hanbang skin care, which is skincare methods and formulas derived straight from ingredients found in nature (mugwort and centella are two pretty big ones and popular atm) - a brand that does this really well and that has really had a chance to solidify it&#39;s identity with that is BOJ. but if you look at most popular Korean skincare brands, they are inspired by the same history and have similar approaches to using the power of ingredients derived from natural sources. i think maybe tirtir is a bit more hesitant to really embrace the Korean terminology and history too strongly here in-case it alienates their international customer base (and remember they did start out with make up and that seems to be their main focus) so they went with a purpose statement that was a bit more appealing or easier for a wide range of cultures and people to grasp but they also lost a little bit of what makes K skincare special in the first place by doing that. i think they really could do awesome things with their skincare products if they follow a little more in BOJ&#39;s footsteps and really embrace their Korean identity in and international capacity a bit more.",51900,8701748,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

First this brand isn&#39;t commonly seen in cosmetics stores in Seoul. Having recently been there I saw no stores I could find aside from something I saw on Google maps in Gangnam that didn&#39;t appear to exist in person. I saw tons of cosmetics stores, but only 1-2 had TirTir products and it was a very trimmed down selection smaller than what I&#39;ve seen here other than the cushion that I saw in a few places. In Japan I actually saw a pop-up, but it was closed for a private event (possibly exclusive).<br><br>As far as the culture, I can&#39;t speak that much from a one day visit, but the marketing in S. Korea seemed far more focused on unattainable perfection. I saw a picture of a shirtless photoshopped guy with 8-pack abs to sell glasses (not sunglasses, the ones to help you actually see). The luxury culture seems baked in, but only to a specific subset of the population, and there are entire markets devoted to &quot;luxury&quot; goods that are really just fakes for $20-40. Having also seen Japan that actually feels like it has a stronger luxury brand culture, I just feel its less in your face than the brand focus portions of Seoul that can almost be equated to portions of LA.",51900,8701748,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I also got that vana box with the mix of make up products recently and can&#39;t wait to try out their base. I don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on their marketing decisions. I imagine the people making the products themselves, which seem to have merit, are very different from the people marketing them. While they maybe should have considered their alignment with influencers and the kind relationship they have publicly, marketing practices are not always the most ethical. It&#39;s all about getting an edge and making your product known.

I think it’s wonderful that they’re listening and honestly even though some people may not like they gifted influencers with expensive gifts. I appreciate them opening up more of their products to cater to different skin types and skin tones. I mean there are so many Korean cushions that those with dark skin would love to be able to experience and simply can’t. And now there’s a better chance that they could! I definitely think they could expand a little more still on the deep darker range, and I heard floating around they’re trying? I’m not sure though. But I’d rather them take their time to get the shades right than rush. ❤ Thanks for this review, I’m definitely going to get some of the products for my mom.

I know we don’t really see your body much, but I have always thought you look like someone who takes really good care of themselves, and not just with your skin care routine. I think most of us that are in the skincare world know that you can’t just apply things topically and look as healthy and radiant as you do. It’s got to be coming from the inside out as well. I’m actually coming to terms with that myself as I’m getting older. I can take all the supplements and use all the best skincare but if I don’t start moving my body more, the effects of old age are going to set in.

In many Asian cultures, <b>especially</b> in South Korea, gift-gifting is VERY important and also VERY common. Changing of the seasons, I think your hair is cool, you stayed 10 minutes after school to help my kid with their homework—any excuse to give a gift, no matter how big or small, they will find one (I experienced it firsthand when I lived there 😅). And exchanging luxury goods is common practice. Many department stores carry special luxury brand sets (perfume, skincare, cosmetics) almost year round that are meant to given as gifts, often to a higher up in your company, business partners, or even the relatives or your spouse/partner to show appreciation. They take their gifts very seriously and will take great care not to give something too small or cheap that would bring shame.<br><br>So in the cultural context, what they did was very innocent and well-intentioned. To them it was likely a genuine token of gratitude for being such big champions of the brand, and wanting to share that success with them.

They are (to my knowledge) the first Korean makeup brand to purposefully cater to a wide range of skin tones and after the disaster that happened with Youthforia it is so nice to see a brand do foundation colors correctly. I love that they are supporting MissDarcie who is a woman of color and deserves nice gifts. Mikayla is just another random influencer who does makeup. She doesn’t represent anything other than lying about mascara so it is disappointing that TirTir gave her such an expensive gift.

So with cushion foundations, you’re supposed to pat the foundation in to the skin. Not swipe it. And once you press the pad into the cushion, you’re meant to dab it on the back of the open lid (the side that presses on to the cushion when you close it) to remove the excess. Obviously, you can do what works for you, but this is the proper way to use this product. 😊",72300,19571914,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

The next day I went and got the Revlon Illuminance Skin-Caring Foundation in that 117 color and it is actually so much better when blended out (I didn’t want ColorStay in 150 Buff Combo/Oily because I already know I won’t like that type of formula on my skin, the Illuminance formula is much more up my alley and the 117 shade is the most neutralized/olive option they have in the fair to light segment). It does pull slightly peachy, but far less so than the About Face turns over time, and I can imagine it would be so much easier to just slightly correct the whole bottle with a blue or green pigment foundation mixer after you find out what blend works the best on the back of your hand. I also read on Reddit in either the OliveMUA or FairOlives groups that someone mixes the shade 105 together with the 117 to slightly lighten and neutralize it since the 105 is very fair and has more yellow warm tones in it, so it may be a better option to grab both for mixing if you’re not interested in trying to sparingly correct with a blue or green corrector or mixer (I find using a pure pigment corrector on foundations that are only slightly off is way harder than fixing foundations that pull wildly yellow like the Smashbox F10 O or very orange like the About Face F2 Olive oxidizes to). I would have tried to fix the About Face since it’s not that unusable in summer even after oxidation, but I hate the doe foot applicator and am not overly impressed with the formula, though it preforms fine (the pump in the Revlon Illuminance is honestly so nice and really lets you do half and quarter pumps, unlike the new Laura Mercier Real Flawless Weightless foundation that comes shooting out no matter how gently you try and push it).",1350000,118226936,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

And I love your advice and your videos because you’re so perfectly helpful for me! I am also a huge Halsey STAN for almost everything she does. And I have to say the olive tone is on point. Masterpiece. I don’t like how this foundation is wearing though 😥. I normally order my face products from nowzenith in Korea.. including my Missha foundation. It’s so soft and beautiful tones for me. I am Caucasian with no Asian heritage, light olive, to be clear. But, TEMU caused a HUGE hold up at the Bloomington California sorting facility for items that went through customs.. so my Makeup from nowzenith didn’t arrive! 😤. So I ran to your channel to find some good recommendations because I have events to go to and I had no idea I would be so behind on my orders from Korea. So my confidence in all things Halsey was high.. I felt reassured I could just stroll in somewhere and get af foundation olive. My mistake again. Olive sold out EVERYWHERE. So I night the L1 warm.. and I kinda hate it 😕. I use beautiful prepping products with spf that actually bend well with so many makeups. And this one is like wax on.. wax off. It’s patchy on me! And it’s not staying put. The L1 is too light and yellow on me and it’s moving and sweating off easily. I feel like a clown. I am so disappointed because I legit thought Halsey can never mess up. I will say.. that the initial application looked worse than when I let it oxidize. But… I took your advice in a pinch and got the Revlon color stay. I don’t want to continue wearing drugstore makeup.. but the buff saved the day. I guess I wanted more coverage.. and halseys isn’t full coverage. But even when I was adding more of halseys.. it just seemed to be a waste because it would move. I don’t know if it’s also just such a bad match by being too light.. or if it’s not playing nice with my products. But.. my products play nice with such an array.. I was shook. In a bad way. I’m sorry Halsey but this isn’t it! I could t believe it. I will try the olive if it ever becomes available because at least $22 isn’t bad. And the olive color is on point. But.. the formula just.. it worked for Alex so nicely. But not for me and I am good at making makeup work. I am wondering Alex if you have done Ariana grande’s rem? I’ll check your videos. I saw that and almost got it the same day I had the panic, but it was ALSO out of the most ligt to olivey looking tone. 🫒 thank you for your videos!",1350000,118226936,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I also highly recommend Rom&amp;nd products, especially for lips and eyes. I would be careful with Asian mascara - while it stays on, it can be challenging to remove. I think the ELF balm works for me, but not micellar water. I’d advise buying an Asian brand eye makeup remover if you go into the mascara, just in case. Granted, it stays on fantastically. But it can be an event to get it off if you aren’t prepared!<br><br>Oh! One last thing: my holy grail eyeliner is from MacQueen, which is another Asian beauty brand.

Packaging is meh but the quality of the shadows is really good.  <br>Lots of great lip and cheek products available for reasonable prices in a good shade selection.  I buy my K beauty stuff from Stylevana.  Ok it takes longer to ship but it’s so much cheaper than Western retailers (the Kaja price point will be eye opening 😂).  While you’re looking around I can vouch for K beauty skincare as most of my skincare is from there.  I buy actives from Western brands mostly and all the hydrating products or cleansing products are K beauty due to the price and INCI lists.

I would recommend watching some YouTube videos about Asian beauty standards and makeup techniques because it’ll help you get an idea for how products are intended to be used. For example, for eyeshadow they don’t really do eyeshadow looks like we do in western makeup. It’s a lot about shading and making the eyes look bigger. Those chunky glitter shades in the unleashia palette? I’ve seen those used most often on the lower lash line to help give more plumpness to the area (along with shading under your eye bag). There are certainly eyeshadows that can look glossy instead of chunky. Amanda Z has a fair bit of Asian beauty content and likes a good glossy eye.<br><br>I think something you might like is Asian beauty mascara because Asian lashes seem to be more often straight and not curl holding. I’ve heard really good things about the Clio kill lash in the red tube. <br><br>Lastly, the romand lip products are something to look into! Lots of pretty shades and textures. Julia Adams just did a lip stain rundown video. <br><br>All in all, buying from sites like Yesstyle make it so it’s not as expensive of a venture to try some of these new products.

I always seek foundation that has a bit grey/muted color beside green tint, cause I think I have the neutral olive skin, not warm olive.

Somehow I came across the Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Clay mask and was just really desperate for something to work on my oily acne prone skin (didn&#39;t realize at the time how dehydrated and needing of better skincare it was). I bought it because it was affordable and I figured why not try another clay mask. I loved it and it was the first clay mask that made my skin feel really good without stripping every once of moisture out of it at the same time. It actually felt hydrated. At that point I actively looked for more products from that brand and from other korean skincare brands. Spent a crap ton of money on beautynet korea to get products and the shipping costed about as much as the products at the time. Came across Charlotte Cho ages ago and bought her book. Haven&#39;t stopped using kbeauty since then.,1530000,192485792,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

Korea has almost never white people until 20th century but we always like brighter complexion (glow) ans even skin (without freckles and pigmentation or acne marks). <br><br>Tone-up cream  is supposed to give you that brightness or evenness where you have redness. <br><br>I am one of those Koreans with hazelish brown eyes, dark brown hair and light skin with freckles. Most white people try to match me still with darker olive foundation, but I usually match exactly with lightest foundation with a cooler pink undertone. Maybe white people should break away from the thought they are actually the lightest- they are actually pink skinned people and I feel we are beige people. <br><br>Anyhow, I dont think most Koreans are self-aware of their skin tone. There are rarely darker people and they do stand out, but in Korean culture standing-out is not a good thing as Asian culture is more about groups and blending in than being individual and private. Also when you&#39;re chubby, people will point it out as that&#39;s also rare and uncommon. People need to comprehend one&#39;s culture before judging. Like I didn&#39;t even know I was light until my Chinese and Filipino friends kept referring me as being pale- and that made me feel bad since now I felt I stand out.",1530000,192485792,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

Having said this I hate to be impertinent but this must be said as this constant complaining about skin color is beyond annoying.   The Asian countries as the European are a fair people making colors based on the people in these countries…. If black people feel underrepresented and or look down upon, I highly suggest they make their own makeup companies based on their own skin color as the aforementioned people have.  Lightening ones skin is really lightening darker pigmentation, to give and even skin tone.  All skin colors go for this it has nothing to do with bias.   I really hope to see black people create their own makeup companies and sell to the world as the Korean Companies have… It’s not a race thing….. it’s a common sense thing.",1530000,192485792,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

But what you say about Korean skincare and values have always been like this for Asians in general. Back then, it wasn’t that big, no one cares, they just knew that it existed.

Even people who are supposed to do middle age or old age role, can’t afford to look old because of the backlash and you can’t sell skincare to an aging skin, as actors are supposed to be gods and shouldn’t be selling skincare to you. So now you have shows and dramas where everyone looks like they’re 17-20 and it looks so weird.<br><br>It’s funny because in my mom’s generation, they only washed their face with rice water, in my age, I struggled with products in order to have just normal skin, now people are all so obsessed with skincare they all wanted to look like Barbies instead of being themselves.

And using their cancel culture mindset that anything that doesn&#39;t follow their beliefs is racist. What all you activists need to do is consider that in the United States tan skin has always been the beauty standard. I&#39;m white and always got told I&#39;m pale and used like a bad word. The girls in my school would use tanning lotion and go to the tanning bed every summer regardless of how bad those are for your health. I don&#39;t see you attacking our own beauty standard. There are bronzers and drops. So as a pale woman I felt relief my skin would be thought as beautiful instead of something to change. Every race has a standard and women who don&#39;t fit that are usually criticized. You can&#39;t attack one race for doing it when every has their own standard of beauty. It&#39;s entitlement to think so. Korea has very few races outside their own in the country. From a business sense it doesn&#39;t compute to make several other shades that may not sell. Considering that the United States has many different populations of people and i don&#39;t see anyone attacking brands here that don&#39;t have expansive shades. Because I&#39;m so fair i rarely find makeup that suits me. Don&#39;t act like a country is racist because of their beauty standard. We have our own here that fair people suffer. I used to really like your channel but now you&#39;re just focusing on these inflammatory topics and think you&#39;re helping. It&#39;s just inciting people to think they know and have an opinion on something. When they aren&#39;t considering the whole picture and how the US favors tan skin. Things have improved so much that many makeup brands have many different shades so don&#39;t attack whoever doesn&#39;t with claims or colorism. It&#39;s short-sighted and seeing all these people parroting the same thing and saying how much they don&#39;t like pale skin is gross. Like now it&#39;s popular to hate your own fair skin and if you don&#39;t you&#39;re not an ally. What a joke. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being fair or dark but every culture has a beauty standard that evolved over centuries. And people whining about it without understanding why is so childish. And also not considering how our own culture does the same for tan skin.,1530000,192485792,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I don&#39;t see why it is a problem in embracing whiter skin tones and setting it as a beauty standard, when Koreans ARE naturally white. It&#39;s all about embracing their own ethnic characteristics. I think it&#39;s nice to embrace the natural ethnic homogenic beauty standard in Korea. Why should Koreans be ashamed of their skin tone? The entire world does not involve around political correctness. Let Koreans embrace their own beauty standards. Leave them alone.

In the past 6mo since i really started trying different things and really really got into kbeauty (i eas always kinda into it, but my esthetician friend told me i needed to exfoliate more after she gave me a facial, and i decided to dive into more research on skincare products), I&#39;ve seemingly settled on a really nice blend of kbeauty and maybe 3 or so western products for my day and night routines, and my skin has gotten so much better. Fewer breakouts (that are no longer several pimples but now maybe 2 at most) that last far shorter, less texture, much more even tone with less redness and irritation and almost no dry/scaly patches, etc. My skin isn&#39;t perfect, which i wouldnt expect it to be, but it&#39;s the best it has been since i was a child when didnt have to worry about anything beyond sun exposure. Ive even gotten compliments on it.<br><br>Dont get me wrong, it&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, it&#39;s all about finding what&#39;s right for your skin. I do use one or two products with salycilic acid in it, but to combat any potential dryness from it i make sure i use centella and niacinamide to hydrate and soothe any potential irritation and dryness that could result from using it day and night (both also help with my skin sensitivity and redness).

If you are in the UK, you can shop TIMY here: ...",4Gwt2wQGeHM,@whereisannah,"To be honest, living in Korea I began to see some of the downsides to constant innovation in Korean skincare. For one thing, Koreans follow trends almost religiously and once that trend is out, it’s on to the next thing. It feels like there’s constantly something “new” which means a product you might’ve really loved is gone the next year. It also heavily promotes consumerism. You get a big bottle of the newest viral item because there was a promotion and then it doesn’t work for your skin. There are ways to re-sell products online but you run the risk of no one buying it off you. I’m more hesitant to try viral products because of irritation concerns due to my sensitive skin. I tried the Roundlab Birch Juice moisturizer and Torriden dive-in cream, both stated to be good for sensitive skin but instead I got angry red bumps. These are super popular products here, so no doubt they work for some people but they can include things like witch hazel and essential oils that irritate sensitive skin.<br><br>Koreans also do wear makeup, it’s just “natural” and the focus is usually on your base makeup. Koreans know right away whether you’re wearing makeup or not (I don’t and when I mention wearing makeup, my coworkers always comment on how I don’t). Lookism and expectations of personal appearance also influence Korean consumers, whereas in the American market there has been a push to “express yourself” through make up (at least during the 2010s). Many western products, especially French (Avene, La roche-posay, etc) are popular amongst Koreans. The government for a long time has promoted and subsidized the development of Korean brands so it makes sense that the quality is so high, and they use this development as a form of soft power abroad. I still have many korean products that I buy consistently but I am more cautious",1530000,192485792,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

My lightest shade is unleashia 21N green cushion and my darkest shade is dior f&amp;b (old formula) in shade 1n (but its the wrong tan shade so its peachy on me. maybe i should have gotten 1w or 1.5w back then). My mid shade is Tir tir 17w (I bought the sample size, unfortunately heavily fragranced so its a no for me). I love liquid formula that is at least medium coverage and buildable to full coverage, sets matte but with skin-like finish. I have dry combo skin and lives in S.E Asia country so its hot and humid. Preferably almost similar to the old formulation of the Dior F&amp;B. I just need to buy 2 shades (my lightest and my darkest shade).",348000,59697362,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I think backstage and forever are very similar formulas to it ( a little diff but still similar traits) I am so glad you mentioned them as I don&#39;t feel like anyone ever does... They&#39;re SO underrated! <br>Estee Lauder Double Wear I think I&#39;ve been wearing for... 17 years at this point. it&#39;s still the one I wear on the daily for work, I wore it for my wedding, I am a musician prone to getting sweaty on stage and I need something that wont fail me... Even if my oils come through it just looks luminous but never oily. It just never ever fails me. I am an oily girl... I would love to know what you prime and set with for Oily skin when using Armani Luminous silk, because the wear time on it for me isn&#39;t great and I end up looking  like a grease ball... I just can&#39;t get longevity out of it on my skin - so would love to know what you use in conjunction with it. I also find Fenty Soft Matte foundation to be VERY similar to Double Wear ☺ <br>I haven&#39;t got my hands on the Lady Gaga one yet! I can&#39;t wait! a little harder to find in Australia though...

If you live in this climate, buyer beware. My face was a grease ball with this sunscreen. Hated it hated it hated it. I wore it indoors. for context, the indoor humidity is about 56-60% and couldn’t stand the greasiness. Next day, wore outdoors(no makeup-only sunscreen). I couldn’t take it. After one hour of wearing I needed to rinse off the oiliness. This has never happened to me with any sunscreen.

Or do you just prefer a dewy finish in your makeup and sunscreen? I have an oily t-zone and tried the Mattescreen under my Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay in Place foundation, and it didn&#39;t pill on me even with my skincare underneath.. Just a thought 😉 ... I currently am using the Suntegrity Moisturizing Mineral Face Sunscreen &amp; Primer that I have been using for a few years. However, it does make me more oily in my tzone. It also does leave a white cast but it goes away. If you have redness, it does help with minimizing that and does work well under makeup. I just dont like that it makes me look greasy in my oily areas. So I wanted to try something different and waiting for it to be done. The Supergoop Mattescreen I tried was a sample.
