And, I did not use a lot at all.  The brush is the way to go.  BTW, I used the little sponge applicator to tap on my concealer powder to set.  That also did an excellent job, so don&#39;t toss it --- reuse it!! Thanks for another great video.  Say, could we see you do some makeup on older glamor girls like Gabbi does??

            "Your seal of approval on a foundation is so important so I really appreciated this video. I wore Tir Tir for the first time today. I‚Äôm 78 with dry-combo skin in summer and since I‚Äôve been using Retin A for years, my skin is minimally wrinkled but I have labial and marionette lines around my mouth which foundations love to settle in. The TirTir looked a little makeupy on my forehead, but natural overall. It didn‚Äôt settle into lines or wrinkles. It‚Äôs tricky to apply though. If you press down enough to get product on the pad, it‚Äôs way too much to apply directly to skin. Rubbing the pad on the inside lid and then applying to face will still result in too heavy a coat. I learned to just pick up just the tiniest bit on the pad, then rub on the lid, then press the whole pad on the lid and then apply. I also tried using a damp sponge which I patted on the product left in the lid. Both those techniques gave me a more natural finish. It did last all day but got pretty glowy. I powdered lightly after 5 hours and it looked great. Unfortunately I got 27N and it‚Äôs a tad too dark &amp; yellow for my skin tone so I ordered the sample kit from Amazon for less than $2 so I can try some different colors before I order again.",

I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. You‚Äôre absolutely correct to the quality of their skincare though. I love the cleansing balm and enzyme cleanser, along with their Niacinamide with Retinol Serum.

            "I have no idea why I&#39;ve been resisting the cushions because I LOVE their skincare line. I think the shade match was freaking me out. Got the red cushion mini and nailed the color on the first try. OMG. I don&#39;t know what kind of magic is in this stuff, but it&#39;s amazing. It stays all day without a primer or spray. I don&#39;t want to claw my skin off at the end of the day. It doesn&#39;t settle into pores or lines (I&#39;m in my 50s with drier skin). And I want to buy a million of the minis for my purse. I also think I can get away with the mini in my purse on a plane without having to put it in my liquids bag, which is a huge bonus for me. The fact that it&#39;s $15-$25 depending on size is a huge bonus. I have a graveyard of foundation bottles that I can now get rid of for good. If you&#39;ve been on the fence like me, just try it.

            "As a dry-combo/normal skin girlie, I am absolutely loving the TirTir Cushion Red (23N Sand) as it feels super secure, and hydrating and is probably a great option for those that have a similar  skin type as I do, who prefer a natural matte finish.<br><br>I bounce around wearing dewy and natural/semi matte foundations depending on season, and I normally wear Haus Labs TriClone Foundation in Light Medium Neutral 210.<br><br>Another thing to note is that the TirTir foundation on first application may look  pale upon first application, but trust the process as this foundation oxidizes pretty beautifully as you get the rest of your makeup done. I was pretty shocked at this at first to be honest. Make sure to also have a great hydrating skin prep before applying, and if you use setting powder, I recommend to opt out in using it as I noticed it adds unnecessary skin texture when I did so. A hydrating setting spray is much better imo.<br><br>My only current gripe with TirTir however is that I cannot seem to find any links or even a functioning official website for refills. I heard that the red cushion foundation is refillable, (could be wrong) and I prefer not purchasing a whole new mirror or puff just for foundation. If anyone knows where I can purchase refills, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!~üôè‚ù§",

After the treatment was complete it went away, my skin was cleared and I haven&#39;t had a problem since. It&#39;s been 20 yrs.",

            "1. ALWAYS prep your skin before foundation, you will look fresh and your skin will keep it&#39;s elasticity <br>2. You can still use powder, but apply it LIGHTLY with a brush, it will actually help conceil creases and avoid having foundation and conceiler clogg them even more which creates a cakey look. I use a large loose powder brush and I like translucent powder or very fine and light powders (ex. rice based, etc)<br>3. Maybe look into ph balancing for your skin, korean lines imo have the best, and I think clinique has some good ones too",

I did learn something new watching this video, though, and that was to tap out the product on the underside of the cover.",

            "I can see the difference with the primer side. Not huge but that‚Äôs a great primer!!",
            "I got the 35N and it was too dark, but I used it as a contour and to cover the acne scars that are on my cheeks.  I wore this for 17  hours while visiting Savannah, Georgia, which is a very hot and humid place.  I put it on at 9:30AM and removed at around 3AM the next day. First I dabbed the Tirtir on my acne scars. The ease with which this goes on is unbelievable. I then followed with the Bare Minerals powder in my skin tone to set, because of how hot and humid Savannah is. Lastly, I spritzed the Tula Signature Glow Face Mist over my whole face. This foundation looked skin like and was flawless after 17 hours of wear in a hot climate, where I sweated all day as I was out and about touring the city. We ended up at a Taco spot at 2AM and when I went to the ladies room and stared into the mirror, I could not believe how amazing it looked. Its as if it became more skin like as time passed and still covered my scars. What sort of witchcraft is this? <br><br>This is the number one foundation in Japan for a reason. The stuff works. Color matching may be a problem though. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was a 35N or a 40N so I ended up buying both. 40N is really too dark for me, but I&#39;ll repurpose as contour as well.  I&#39;ve ordered the 34N and 33N and am hoping one of these are a match. Tirtir doesnt do a good job showing the colors for matching but the foundation itself is gold.  I don&#39;t see myself using anything else once I find a match.  The stuff is magic, it really is.",
            "I put three fingers through the pad so I get even coverage on the sponge when I dab. I start on the outside of the face and move toward the inside so I don&#39;t get a big glob near the nose.",
            "It actually looks very nice on you!",

            "Risa, if you watch Robert Welsh‚Äôs YouTube video ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt people use this foundation right?‚Äù, he explains that we‚Äôre supposed to put our index finger and ring finger under the ribbon on the pad, with our middle finger out. He was specific and it was helpful, just in case you want to check that out!?",
            "You might do better with Sand color in Tir Tir.",
            "Hi Risa. You and I share the same oily skin gene and similar skin tone. I purchased the tirtir in the pink packaging and this one was most matte finish of the brand. Even with this formula, I was oily by 6-7 hours in. The veil primer and OS setting spray gave me about an extra hour of wear time. Thank you Risa for being authentic and honest. I can always depend on your reviews for my needs. I‚Äôm 50 yo for reference.",
            "I&#39;m wearing it every day and love it!  I live in the humid South!  It doesn&#39;t budge until I take it off.  I have mature combination skin.  I ordered the samples from Amazon and found that Latte was my color.",

I think that it&#39;s a  foundation it is formulated for an environment which is HUMID - not like here -- I mean WET AIR! The colors are also the same, I think. Culturally the skin in that part of the world is lighter than here.",
            "I&#39;m 61 and I have bought this product on repeat. I use a makeup brush to apply. It melts into my skin and blends effortlessly. I have gotten compliments on this foundation. I use a primer with all foundations. Thank you for honest content.",
            "Robert Welsh has a great tutorial video as well because you see so right Risa. I bought a much too lighter shade the first time didn‚Äôt apply it right but I gave it another shot &amp; bought a better shade now I love it!",

            "I‚Äôm so disappointed in this foundation. I bought 4 different colors on Amazon and they were all yellow on me. The finish is beautiful but they just don‚Äôt have a color match for my light-medium neutral to cool skin tone.",
            "I have Lupus, and periodically get a Malar (Butterfly) Rash across both sides of my face. It is very pronounced and I have never found a make-up or even combination of make-ups that will cover it. One application of this Tir Tir foundation covers that rash completely. I even went in to see my dermatologist and rheumatologist to show them, and they were both shocked at the coverage. At 76 years old, this even covers sun spots, hides wrinkles and creases, and I no longer have to use concealer anywhere. And, it&#39;s affordable. Who could ask for anything more???",

            "Would love to try this foundation but unfortunately Tirtir, like most brands, thinks cool toned means pumpkin orange. I literally don‚Äôt understand why NO brands can come up with an actual rosy cool shade. I tried two shades of this and they are literally pumpkin. 32 shades isn‚Äôt that innovative or impressive when the shades they create are not inclusive or accurate in any way.",

            "23N, great color",
            "I just received this foundation so haven‚Äôt tried it yet. I think I will like it with my combo to dry skin. Most foundations are too matte for me.",

I‚Äôve purchased like 4 extras just so that I never run out of it.<br>The secret to using this foundation is not to use a brush with it. Use only the sponge and it will literally seal your pores.

I had to sponge a lot off. I personally did not like it. I am a dewy BB cream/ light-med coverage person, and this was high coverage matte and cakey so the opposite of what I like.... tried the samples for the hype but it was faaar to heavy for me, glad I did not get the full one, so gave the rest of the samples to friends.

            "Elf foundation looks gorgeous",
            "Hi Angie‚Ä¶ You need to tap the sponge into the TirTir only once, then work it into the sponge evenly on the back of the plastic lid before applying. Then you get a thinner, more even coat. I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and it looks great.",
            "I have younger combination skin (no lines no wrinkles, small pores only with a small patch of dark spot).  But I don&#39;t like the Tir Tir cushion either. I think the Tir Tir is overhyped. If you really want to try again, try using with a damp beauty blender but expecting sheer coverage. Using less product with minimal skincare also works too. But I won&#39;t repurchase as there are so many good choices of foundation in the market.",
            "What did you use on your eyelids for this video. So beautiful.",
            "It&#39;s wild how the same product reacts differently on different people. The Tirtir is a freaking DREAM for me. I use a LOT less than Angie did and I&#39;ve found that it performs best with nothing underneath it (no primer or anything else). But again, that&#39;s just on MY skin. Your mileage may vary.",
            "I was hoping to say that you loved it because I&#39;ve been watching you for a while.  I love the Tirtir, its quick application and long wear has me hooked. This is all I use when I travel for work. Tirtir stays put for 8+ hours of travel. In fact, I wore it for 15 hours once, and my skin looked like skin, but better. I was impressed.¬†<br><br>I put the Tirtir on cleansed moisturized skin, set with a powder and then spray it afterwards with the Tula signature glow spray.  I adjust whether I use moisturizer prior to application depending on whether I am headed to the South (warmer no need for a moisturizer, my skin will moisturize itself) or North (colder weather dictates the need for a light moisturizer). <br><br>I think you may have put on too much of the Tirtir. I will look at my skin more closely at the end of the day next time I use it. Now I&#39;m curious.",
            "Totally agree about the Tir Tir. I am 55 and it was sliding around and wearing off. I wore it 2 times. I use EltaMd sunscreen. It separated and looked awful. I haven‚Äôt tried Elf yet but will.",
            "I looove Tir tir, BUT would recommend (like Niki La Rose) to use a brush! That way you get less product and don‚Äôt end up that cakey. It is so beautiful with way less product",
            "You use about 20 times more TirTir than I use. I‚Äôm 63. It‚Äôs better if it‚Äôs not packed on. You need a light hand as a little goes a long way. You can also use a brush to buff it out. I don‚Äôt use it as a full coverage and I don‚Äôt need much just to even out and has even replaced my concealer. I will powder my t-zone and eyelids. I love my TirTir and it has replaced my BB creams.",
            "So happy you did this test! I bought it during Prime Days and barely tried it‚Ä¶ probably wrong shade and too heavy fit my mature dry skin. I hear their is a newer one out that may look better.",

            "The ELF makes me look greasy after a few hours even after a  light powder set and spray.  And it wore off on my nose.  I will keep trying to work with it but... I am losing patience. Good thing that it is so cheap.",

            "thank you for this video!",
            "I am 52...with deep wrinkles on my forehead and big pores. I also have very oily skin. It covered up all my imperfections and did not settle in my wrinkles. I applied it with the sponge only on my cheeks and forehead and then used my beauty blender to spread it out. Use the Tir Tir makeup setting spray, lightly powered only in the t zone, and it stayed on ALL DAY. I bought the color swatches for $1.50 to get the correct color.",
            "This is my holy grail right now, I absolutely love this foundation. I was hoping you would do a test with it. Thank you!",
            "So I finally received my TirTir foundation order.  I watched this video before it arrived and worried that I made a mistake buying it.  I didn‚Äôt know it was even popular on Tiktok but wanted to try the Korean makeup.  I‚Äôm happy to say I love it.  I think the key is to make sure you apply a thin layer and spread it out.  Putting on too much will make it look very makeup-y.  I have dry skin and I didn‚Äôt experience cracking on my dry areas.  I‚Äôve worn it twice and it‚Äôs a new favorite.  I only bought the smaller size to try it first.  I bet it will last me a long time since a small amount goes a long way.  It will definitely be great for traveling.",

            "Totally agree with your critique of TirTir.",
            "I wanted to love the TirTir so much. I love the coverage in such a thin formula, but it does get very shiny throughout the day and the Asian sunscreen in it made me break out so terribly. I just tried the new Huda blur foundation and returned it. It gets super shiny, separates, crackles on my skin, and settles into every line.",

            "Thank you so much for this review!  The daylight shots were wonderful.  Now I can take this off my wish list ‚ù§",
            "I‚Äôve also tried both and fully agree with the result. I find using a luminous spf, the Elf putty primer with the Elf satin foundation works best for me. It wears off naturally. My first purchase of Tirtir was the smaller version that was too light. I ended up using it as a concealer. I don‚Äôt recommend Tirtir."

You‚Äôre supposed to press the sponge into the compact once, tap off the excess on the inside of the black cover, and then pat it on. The thing with the sponge is it picks up A LOT of foundation, and it will stay in there (what doesn‚Äôt end up on your face). It‚Äôs not like a beauty blender. One or two presses into the compact will cover your whole face. It is supposed to be a very light application at first, and if you want to build on it, you can.

After working for 12 hours inside an aircraft, the foundation was still FLAWLESS. With the ampoule, it finishes more glowy, and I simply adore it. It has so much coverage that I need only the smallest amount to cover a pretty big surface of skin. I absolutely recommend it!",

If a brand decides that an influencer Deserves getting a bag from them  that&#39;s their choice, It does not reflect on their product. Is the product good then buy, If  the product sucks, don&#39;t buy it. People with no money are very quick to judge people with money. It&#39;s their money. They&#39;re allowed to do whatever they want with it.If we had the money to blow on purses, i&#39;m sure we would hate for other people to tell us no, don&#39;t buy a purse donated to charity instead.

It seems this is your look on all your videos.<br>You are beautiful but the oily shine is distracting.<br>I can&#39;t get behind that under makeup. At night yes!

            "Alice I have recently started using Tirtir ampule and I feel like it is finally THE product for my dry face. Even though it is summer where I am, I am so happy with how thick and gummy it is! I had no idea I needed this. It almost seals my skin, it so wonderfully protective. I watched another review of this ampule by Kelly Driscoll who said it is too heavy. And I think this is really NOT for combination skin types. Just don&#39;t buy it if you have combination, normal or oily skin. I am excited to start using the toner and cream as soon as they arrive.",

            "Even though it&#39;s great that tirtir offers a huge shade range, but some of the shade just seems way off. For example, I have used at least 6 different korean brands of the cushion foundation of shade 23W. Though the undertone all differs slightly between the brand, but I find tirtir to be way off (very orange, and the shade one shade up/down also off). In addition, their formula seems to oxidize ALOT more than the others (even with primer).  As amazing as their coverage &amp; longevity is, i am not that impressed.",

            "I have VERY DRY SKIN,, I hope it works with the foundation ???",
            "i know as a westerner it sounds weird for a brands mission to be merging science and nature (haven&#39;t we heard it a million times before from western brands who legitimately don&#39;t even try to live up to the statement - see insert essential plant oild at bottom of ingredients list) so i definitely get it sounds odd. however if you look at it through the lens of Korean culture and how Koreans developed their skin care, their influences etc, i think it does make sense. Koreans are really big on Hanbang skin care, which is skincare methods and formulas derived straight from ingredients found in nature (mugwort and centella are two pretty big ones and popular atm) - a brand that does this really well and that has really had a chance to solidify it&#39;s identity with that is BOJ. but if you look at most popular Korean skincare brands, they are inspired by the same history and have similar approaches to using the power of ingredients derived from natural sources. i think maybe tirtir is a bit more hesitant to really embrace the Korean terminology and history too strongly here in-case it alienates their international customer base (and remember they did start out with make up and that seems to be their main focus) so they went with a purpose statement that was a bit more appealing or easier for a wide range of cultures and people to grasp but they also lost a little bit of what makes K skincare special in the first place by doing that. i think they really could do awesome things with their skincare products if they follow a little more in BOJ&#39;s footsteps and really embrace their Korean identity in and international capacity a bit more.",

            "Did you try the Tir Tir pure vitamin C 24 serum?",
            "When it comes to the bag, my first thought was about korean culture. One of best friends is korean and when she came to visit me, she got gifts for her family and the monotary value was the most important aspect. The gift needed to be a recognized luxery brand. It was weird as an american who grew up on the phrase &quot;its the thought that counts&quot; but thats just culture. I really think the birkin controversy is just a big cultural misunderstanding (they they hopefully learned from)",
            "A few notes on some of the side elements discussing the brand. First this brand isn&#39;t commonly seen in cosmetics stores in Seoul. Having recently been there I saw no stores I could find aside from something I saw on Google maps in Gangnam that didn&#39;t appear to exist in person. I saw tons of cosmetics stores, but only 1-2 had TirTir products and it was a very trimmed down selection smaller than what I&#39;ve seen here other than the cushion that I saw in a few places. In Japan I actually saw a pop-up, but it was closed for a private event (possibly exclusive).<br><br>As far as the culture, I can&#39;t speak that much from a one day visit, but the marketing in S. Korea seemed far more focused on unattainable perfection. I saw a picture of a shirtless photoshopped guy with 8-pack abs to sell glasses (not sunglasses, the ones to help you actually see). The luxury culture seems baked in, but only to a specific subset of the population, and there are entire markets devoted to &quot;luxury&quot; goods that are really just fakes for $20-40. Having also seen Japan that actually feels like it has a stronger luxury brand culture, I just feel its less in your face than the brand focus portions of Seoul that can almost be equated to portions of LA.",
            "Yes - it‚Äôs so frustrating that we send billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars to other countries(notably Israel)  who are committing genocide with our money! Millennial here- and never felt so depressed and disaffected by our government. Never.",
            "I tried most of the skincare line. I think it‚Äôs very good for the most part and especially at the price point. I just started using it so I could change my mind.",
            "There really are no results to gain here‚Ä¶..the only changes in your skin‚Ä¶will come from constant deliberate actives‚Ä¶..these are just hydrating‚Ä¶you will not Gabe any amazing changes‚Ä¶.",
            "I&#39;ma try that ceramic ampoule come winter! So glad they have mini sizes though, like you said, many plant ingredients may offer more risks.",

I don‚Äôt follow or support Mikayla because I‚Äôm not a makeup girlie, but I was hoping to get into tirtir skincare. Maybe it was purely a gift? She looked genuinely shocked when she got the bag. That‚Äôs how I saw it. Anyway, I truly appreciate you Alice. Thanks for staying genuine. Maybe I‚Äôll still give tirtir a chance.

Whichever  color you chose, I know exactly what to choose. I have to say, while looking at the swatches online, with 3 cool colors preceding it, I would never have chosen 21C. There was a gal on YT who happened to be an albino, who tested the the lightest color at the time, which was 15C, and it has orange, orange, orange!

It took ages to arrive, but I was excited when I got it, in shade 23N, sand.<br>I was annoyed, because it looked so dark and orange, but I had to try it on. As I was applying it, it made me look orange; to be fair more peach than orange.<br>And then something happened. After 10 minutes or so, I looked at my face, and lo and behold, no more orangey face, just my real skin colour, light neutral, slightly cool. This was the reverse of oxidation!!!?<br>By the way, according to some reviews, I pressed the puff very lightly against the sponge and then tapped it on my face in a few places, as you would with a standard foundation, and then spread it all over with my hands. But if I would use more product, I would have spread it with a brush.<br>As you have demonstrated, the foundation stays put and beautiful all day, well at least for 10 hours.<br>The price if this foundation on Yesstyle varies all the time, but it is very reasonable for what it is. I would say US$20 or around ¬£16 in the UK.",
            "I suffer from redness in my face from god knows what - when I talk, get excited whatever else.. it‚Äôs so weird. I know it‚Äôs not rosecia. I went to get a facial from someone who basically put 1 mask on my face, left for 20 minutes, came back, did another mask and came back in 10 minutes- that was the facial. $60! Then she had the nerve to tell me I have rosecia. I was so mad. I am 45 years old, I would know by now if I had it or not. I just have very sensitive skin. Plus I am very pale redhead with green eyes that‚Äôs why my skin is such a nightmare. <br>Anyways, I just wanted to share that with you because I understand what you meant.",

            "For the love of all things holy please learn to use this foundation correctly when providing a review and feedback. Too often individuals reviewing this foundation goes straight into it and applied directly to their face. That is not how you apply this foundation. You dip the applicator into the product and then pat off the excess on the back of the lid. Then apply when you apply this product in the manner that she is applying it you end up with a substantial amount of product on your face that should not be there with correct application. The amount of product that was placed on her face during this review was enough product for two weeks of every day whereas it was not applied correctly. So please prior to giving a review do your homework and provide feedback based upon application.",

            "Hi Glamfam! Happy National Asian Heritage month to all my Asian Glamfam sisters! Representing my daddy&#39;s (Japanese) side it was fun to honor an asian owned brand and to personally know how popular this is in Japan! Avorie was able to tell me that it&#39;s literally everywhere in Japan that she goes! Many others read the claims and talking points on how this is #1 seller in Japan but we personally know someone to witness that and give us that feedback which is awesome! Avorie knew about this well before social media made it popular and sorry it took me so long Amber to review this!   I hope to someday be able to visit Japan! üáØüáµ This blew up on Tiktok and thanks to the incredible asian influencers on that platform and the  amazing and talented Robert Welsh on YouTube! Then every other big influencer jumped on and spread the word TirTir even more!! Putting this K-beauty brand on the map!  But being an Asian YouTuber (over 46),  it was fun to review this from my perspective and hopefully help others make a decision on whether this was right for them! I will give you my update below on how often I use this. Also Regina and Amber both bought this on YesStyle ‚û§<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+rU8FkxolQYJd2_WkUpkmag\">https://rstyle.me/+rU8FkxolQYJd2_WkUpkmag</a> and you can get a sample for like a $1 so maybe try that first but always remember Amazon returns quite easy if you can find your shade prime that&#39;s the tricky part! <br><br>Update:<br>I don&#39;t wear full coverage foundations on a normal basis and I personally still love my Maybelline skin plus vitamin c the most and then Surratt for special occasions but sometimes I will use this more as a spot conceal and like that better than concealer! I do use this very sparingly but for the purpose of trying this video I used a lot! So my recommendation moving forward is go more sparingly especially with mature skin and that is a bit easier sometime with a brush and then sponge to blend out. I will play with this more in real life and maybe even on another video.I will probably have to up the shade to 24w if I get tanned more during the summer months! I may buy that sample just to test out other shades. ‚ù§",
            "See I thought that the sponge that they gave us in the compact worked extremely well I mean it doesn&#39;t soak up any of the foundation at all it&#39;s kind of coolüòä And the key to that too is tap tap tap a lot of people that I have seen it&#39;s like there rubbing it in or doing circular motions ü§∑üòÆ",

If you&#39;re having issues so sorry but I&#39;m not sure why. Maybe (and sometimes this happens to me) but the volume on the YouTube screen is down so try increasing that.

            "This was very interesting!  I have ordered the TirTir cushion via YesStyle, but it‚Äôs taking forever with delivery.  However, I really enjoyed seeing how you deconstructed how cushions work and making your own.  I do wonder why the cushion compact you bought didn‚Äôt come with the sponge and puff.  Seems like it should have been a little kit with all three parts.",

It oxidized on me quickly and I found it just too dewy looking for me.  I returned it. I will, however, try making my own cushion foundation which I never knew could be done.",
            "TirTir did not work<br>For me.  It was patchy and didn‚Äôt  absorb into my skin.   Worst foundation I ever tried.  I use Maybelline and Loreal True Match skin tint. Both work great for me‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "Most people use the cushion incorrectly.  They really press the cushion much too hard and get way too much on it and then press it too aggressively on the face.  A very light tap on the cushion and a very light tap on the face.  It is meant to be sheer and skin like.  It can be buildable if you want a more dense foundation.  Too much though can end up creasing in places.",
            "I never knew of this. Thanks for sharing!",
            "Wow. I never realized I could make my own cushion foundation! I also love my Catrice HD. I can golf 18 holes, in the heat, and it still looks good when I get home.",
            "Great ideas, in fact I purchased and use this because of you from a couple years ago! It works wonderfully -  (plus the glass palette for mixing)  You have the best ideas - so thank you!!! :)",
            "Years ago (MANY years ago), I √∫sed to wear the Max Factor Whipped Creme cushion formula. They only made it for a few years, and I stopped looking for a substitute as O developed rosacea and thought the foundation might have been a contributing cause for redness and rough patches. I remember the Max Factor was pretty heavily fragranced, so maybe this was the problem. But I have so many base-type products going right now, I&#39;ll probably wait until fall/winter to explore other formulas. Thanks for the video anyway! It&#39;s always good to see you looking so good!",
            "I love the DIY aspect of this üíôüíõ‚ù§üíöüíú",
            "Big fan of cushion foundation. Tried alot of different ones, and the tirtir oxidizes too much for me (at least 2 shades darker by mid day).  It is always difficult to find a good match so I can see the value of putting your own foundation in a empty cushion.  I havent had great luck of doing that either but maybe just need to keep trying,"

Tirtir is definitely a safe bet for a full glam long wear daytime or nighttime look and it photographs well.

We&#39;re in the Bay area now along the California Delta River. It&#39;s called Oakley. Lots of farmers and boat people. It&#39;s quiet and nice. So that&#39;s our plan.

I&#39;m so happy for you! I hope your health is doing well. I know it&#39;s a lot. I hate it. I wear oxygen 24/7 &amp; it&#39;s so hard to keep makeup on cuz a rubs off in certain areas. Frustrating!!! I use primers, sprays, powders etc. <br>I hope you are feeling better after your tests and that the doctors will find a way to help you. I just hope you&#39;re ok. I&#39;m doing ok. Lots of pain, weakness, stomach problems like crazy, auto immune diseases it&#39;s a lot. But we keep going cuz we know it&#39;ll get better. Good days are the best!

            "I really like Sulwhasoo and yeah I basically just buy minis from Stylevana sometimes in the 50% off weekly sales. Of note, the timetreasure line is being discontinued (or has already been discontinued) and replaced by the &quot;S&quot; line as per the flagship store in Seoul. Not entirely ideal since their creamy cleanser doesn&#39;t seem to have a replacement, but as long as the Amorepacific one stays I&#39;m good to go. Speaking of Amorepacific, Sulwhasoo is owned by AmorePacific and aside from fragrance and the focus on ginseng the products are very similar so if you&#39;ve tried one and are wondering about the other you probably have a good idea of your first impression. As far as specifics, the activating serum and toners are interesting for me in that I don&#39;t like them unless I have multiple toner steps in my routine. I think this mitigates some of the heavy alcohol implications (specifically with product absorption) which works for my routine but isn&#39;t necessarily a net positive. I&#39;m with you on cleansing products they were fine, even good, but not my holy grails and I do feel the moisturizer line you referenced are my favorite products. The remaining serums are also very high performing skin supplements, but they just can&#39;t do what a tret or l-ascorbic acid will achieve.<br><br>End of the day, I can get 50ml of moisturizer for $40 or less and full amounts of serums for $50-60 or less by buying the samples. To me the value is there, but it&#39;s on each individual to determine whether its how they can an want to spend their money",
            "I&#39;ve used quite a few products from this brand, and I think it&#39;s even worse than HERA. They&#39;re either too heavy or have no effect at all",
            "I just loved all Sulwhasoo product as been using it since 18 years &amp; has changed the texture of my skinüëåthe ginseng smell so divine just loved itüíïüëåüòç",
            "Absolutely gorgeous! I&#39;d love to try it outüòç",
            "Any older people on here using this brand? Which if the products do you use and works best?",
            "Alice, are you planning a comparecent video between Donginbi vs. Sulwhasoo? I think Donginbi&#39;s inci list is better what do you thinkü§î also which is too parfumed? And the resurch and red ginseng formulationes....etc. if you feel like making one Im up for itü•∞ü§©",
            "Is this product good on sensitive skin?",
            "Remember asking exactly for this vid :3 Thanks you so much for making it!  <br>P.S. you didn&#39;t find any differences in the effects/texture/smell/etc between full size and minis, right? :&gt;",
            "üòÜ I&#39;m always dropping things.  I popped my pinky out of the socket this week.  Don&#39;t realize how helpful those things are until they aren&#39;t working at 100%.  Last night, I tried to put my moisturizer back up on it&#39;s little shelf and it ended up in the sink.  Thank goodness for plastic packaging!",
            "Love the SW quote. From my point of view, minis are evil! üòÇ<br><br>I really want to try this brand but I&#39;m apprehensive because the risk vs reward seems too high for me with my poor wallet and sensitive skin üòÖ<br>I love ginseng and would love to see more recommendations.",

            "I do still love the overnight mask used as a moisturiser. I liked the ginseng moisturiser better before the reformulation (when I think it included some retinol), but probably just have to shift over to the classic cream.",
            "Thanks Alice for this timely video! I just treated myself to a Sulwhasoo Mini Set from Sephora Rewards for 500 points. I really did notice a difference after one PM use. I am 42 years old, so I will definitely be snagging some more First Aid minis on my next yes or style order!",

            "Did you know that your videos come up in the mornings here in Europe? It‚Äôs fantastic so I can do my skin care routine and my coffee while listening to these reviews üòÑ",
            "I adore minis due to having a poor attention span and I get bored too easily üòÇ.  ps my cat isn‚Äôt my friend now I‚Äôve put my samples on my face!! So if you love kitty cuddles, id avoid!",
            "I&#39;ve tried Sulwhasoo based on one of your¬†review videos, and was obsessed with the brand! I&#39;ve tried the mini Ultimate S cream (purchased it during Black Friday). Honestly, I think it feels nice but for the price, I prefer the concentrated ginseng more because of the scent and price. The¬†Ultimate S cream¬†had more of a subtle fruit/floral fragrance compared to the earthy scent. However, it doesn&#39;t go on heavy which is great for those who prefer¬†something light but I can&#39;t say how effective it is for drier skin types.¬† ¬†<br><br>Great video as¬†always, Alice! I would love to see an updated video on your &quot;Ginseng for skin&quot; review one day!",

            "Your hair is EVERYTHING",
            "Yay Sulwhasoo!  Its still one of the few luxury brands I feel is worth it (on sale of course).  Scent wise I find Sulwhasoo pretty mild, I tried a couple minis from Amore Pacific and couldn&#39;t use it due to the fragrance.",
            "Love your video Alice <br>This just a recommendation I know that you made a video about ( skin1004 ) you think you can re update about skin 1004 ?",
            "I love sulwhasoo! Yes style is place to buy and save $$$$ ‚ù§",
            "I personally think the Sulwhasoo cleansing oil is my favorite one so far because it consistently removes all the blackheads and whiteheads from my nose every time I use it. I haven‚Äôt found another cleansing oil like that. Plus it smells sooo good! It‚Äôs also 30% off ($28) right now for Amazon prime day",
            "There are some Sulwhasoo deals on Prime Day (7/16-7/17/24) too!",
            "I agree that minis are sufficient for masks. They last a long time and you don&#39;t need much for every use. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried the overnight sleeping mask and it made my skin so soft in the morning! Honestly did not expect it to work that well. The clarifying mask is also very satisfying because it truly can peel in one piece. My skin feels smoother afterwards. <br><br>I&#39;ve used the concentrated ginseng balancer and emulsion (mini sizes), but felt they were just okay. The concentrated ginseng serum made me break out a little, which is not usual for me! <br><br>Have you used Whoo? I&#39;m a massive fan of the Gonjinhyang (orange) line, I swear my skin looks amazing and I won&#39;t break out with it. Their minis are cheaper than Sulwhasoo. <br><br>I also recommend trying Cle de Peau softening lotion - it really makes the skin softer. There&#39;s a faint but pleasant fragrance. I did not expect to like it!",
            "I agree with your take on minis! I was disappointed when I picked up minis of the essential balancing water and emulsion - it was so hard to get the emulsion out of the small bottle üòÖ",
            "Ahh yes 2019 the era of fragrance phobia üòÇ Hyram literally brainwashed a whole generation",
            "I keep thinking it‚Äôs expensive until I realise that I can buy it on sale for the same as I can buy Neutrogena, L‚ÄôOreal and Olay here in Australia.",
            "but why are they full of fragrance :(",
            "i love minis but they are so rare and i would love it if i could buy samples!",
            "As much as I love their fragrances and ingredients, a lot of the Sulwhasoo leave on products sensitize my skin. I do get minis every once in a while to use on my body or just to experience the luxurious textures! I‚Äôve gotten their foaming cleanser as well in the full size and although it‚Äôs nothing groundbreaking, the scent is what gets me! Also the price on that product is actually reasonable on some of the Korean retailers. I loved to use the ginseng line on my hands and feet when it‚Äôs cold outside to boost up circulation and I haven‚Äôt had any issues there. I wish the peeling mask was more of a gel like the im from mugwort mask, but oh well! It‚Äôs a pain to remove if you don‚Äôt do a thick layerüòÇ thanks as always for your in depth review!",
            "Sulwhasoo is on sale for prime day! I still can&#39;t afford it but I hope others can lol",
            "I never used this brand as I never buy luxury skincare, I use my luxury item budget for makeup as I don&#39;t like cheap or drugstore makeup, but when it comes to skincare I prefer the affordable variety. The products do sound interesting, the mini size might me something I will try",
            "800?? is it made from garden of eden plant extracts?",
            "I have the opposite experience with Overnight mask. For some reason my skin felt so dry every morning after using this. But, I&#39;m planning to get other minis to try :)",
            "I love this brand!!",
            "That tin is my sewing kit!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br>Great video!  Many blessings!!!üíñüíñüíñ",
            "The way I was kind of hoping you‚Äôd give some criticisms because I‚Äôve been fighting for my life to not allow myself to buy full sizes of the ginseng line üò©üò©üò©<br><br>But I will say that I never believed in the concept of luxury moisturizer because how good can a moisturizer be‚Ä¶until I bought a mini renewal cream. I couldn‚Äôt articulate how it was so good, but it really was - totally worth the price if you can swing it.",
            "I do like luxury Korean skincare. The serums are spectacular ‚ù§",
            "The brand review that I&#39;m most excited about. I have been watching your videos for a while and I love every single one I&#39;ve watched. I&#39;m definitely a big fan of Sulwhasoo and my dry sensitive acne prone skin seems to love Sulwhasoo products so much. I&#39;ve tried the whole line of concentrated ginseng products and no bad reaction at all despite all the fragrances.",
            "Went into Sephora and try out some Suwoohshoo on my hands and got suffocated by the strong fragrance.",
            "hey alice! i really appreciate that you keep the ingredients list for the products on the screen for a SUPER LONG time because i frequently do my little &quot;skincare-walking-back-and-forth&quot; while your video is playing and it&#39;s super helpful because when i come back to the screen i can read the ingredients and catch up!!!<br><br>sometimes i take the &quot;price per ounce&quot; thing too far for minis and i end up purchasing the bigger one because its more value and guess who ends up looking like a fool when it irritates my skin... ü§•ü§•ü§• that aside, lovely video as always! always looking forward to your videos &lt;3",

I have bought the mini size  of the first care activating serum and the overnight mask from Sulwhasoo all too frequently... üòÇ<br><br>I have bought the balancing essence but I think I can skip the additional cost for this product. <br><br>I will continue to buy the cleansing foam since I like its gentle formula in a foam cleanser... <br><br>The moisturizer is too costly and I prefer to stay with the Chogongjin instead... üéâ",

            "Ok if Lamer was bought... Dior is still French and was never American. Its confusing because you&#39;re talking about trying Korean skincare vs American while using basically French and German brands.",
            "I‚Äôve been using luxury products for about 18 months now. I‚Äôve gone through routines from, La Mer, Sulwhasoo, SK-II, Shiseido, Tatcha, and The History of Whoo. And depending on one‚Äôs skin issues, it does take more than a month to see drastic positive change. And as mentioned, it‚Äôs best to stay loyal to a brand than mixing and matching too much. My tip is to have one brand as a core, and maybe have 1-2 products that isn‚Äôt from the brand, like a face wash and an active. One thing to note is that most luxury skincare is aimed towards more mature skin, or people in their 30s. Starting early doesn‚Äôt hurt, just be mindful that one won‚Äôt see results right away and that textures will usually be on the heavier side even when they‚Äôre supposedly for oily skin.<br><br>I honestly think luxury beauty is worth it. It truly works on increasing resilience in the skin which lessens breakouts and slows down aging without the use of strong exfoliants or retinoids. But it takes time to see this effect. Like more than 6 months of consistent use. My skin has only had a major breakout during this time, which was due to traveling and less than good diet. <br><br>My honest thoughts is that any luxury brand will do! You just have to find one that speaks with your skin and find the products for your skin type. Just because one cream feels heavy doesn‚Äôt mean the whole brand is a waste. Pick one brand and stick to it. My personal favorite is Shiseido, their formulas and textures are top notch. Love Sulwhasoo, but it‚Äôs not as readily available for me. I hate to say it, but La Mer, the cream, there‚Äôs something magic about it. I use it more as a night treatment once a week during winter and can do with one of the smaller jars. I like the simplicity of a SK-II skincare routine, but their cream and serum is very heavily fragranced, so I only endorse the Pitera essence and their face wash. Honestly, more people should talk about their face wash.",
            "You have to try Savef Skin Essential Face Serum- luxury serum.witout fragrance, no nonsense. Please try something new! It&#39;s $155 and it is amazing. Evens my skin hydrates, and I have no hormonal break outs??? Real Skin Retinue is the brand only one product! üòä",
            "La merüëéüëéüëéüëé",
            "I‚Äôm sorry you missed this, but most of the products you used were not American. Augustinus Bader is German, La Mer is also German, Sulwhasoo is Korean, SK-II is Japanese, and Dior is French. The only products you used that were American were from Shani Darden, which you said you liked. Almost every single luxury brand that‚Äôs popular in America is from other countries like France or Italy. <br><br>That being said, I‚Äôve tried a lot of these products and I totally agree with you, the only ones that are really worth it are the Sulwhasoo and Shani Darden. Dior‚Äôs skincare is kind of a flop and the rest are just so expensive and not worth it tbh.",

            "you are soooo pretty!!!",
            "Augustinus Bader cream stinks so bad. I can only use it the mornings before applying spf and make up. It serves as a good moisturizing primer.",
            "Thank you so much for mentioning that korean skincare will market the actual ingredients to the buyers where as American luxury products do not. I started using korean skincare back in 2016 and I noticed a big positive change in my skin. I think it&#39;s because korean skincare makes it known to the buyer what the ingredients are and what they are for. This helped me learn what ingredients works for my skin and which ingredients do not. Korean skincare really helped me learn about skincare ingredients which I now carry over to American skincare products when purchasing.",
            "love this video! the only brand that i dislike is La Mer. their moisturiser gives me bad pimple! like the huge painful ones :( the best thing about the moisturiser is, it is a good make up based as it makes my makeup looks so flawless. sadly the fragrance is so strong hence why i have bad breakouts.",
            "Augustinus Bader is German not American but boy that cream is magic. I bought it on Black Friday to test and it changed my skin like crazy in a few days and it was already in a good place. I went and bought the whole range soon after. I have no regrets. I never spent so much money on skincare. I will never use anything else. It‚Äôs also scent free which I love!",

            "The traditional Korean/Chinese/Japanese medicinal principle actually recommends steeping the herbs and proprietary medicine inside wine, so as to help preserve and enhance the delivery system. For ingestion, because it is a very low amount ingested, the effects are actually better because there is very little alcohol in the body and plus, the body organs react to alcohol differently from the skin, which does not have the same ability to break down alcohol unlike the liver or kidney. Recently, I read that even a little alcohol is used to ferment herbs and the extract derived from this fermentation process is way more potent than just steeping the herbs alone. The bacterial action over time probably neutralises the alcohol too.",
            "The Balancing line in Sulwhasoo is really not moisturizing enough for winter, especially in South Korea and Canada as I discovered. The Timetreasure line is actually more moisturizing, but it is just so pricey!",
            "This is one of my favorite skincare brands, I am a confirmed K Beauty-holic ü§£ my favorite Sulwhasoo products are the gentle cleansing foam, First Care serum, Overnight Vitalizing Mask (I use it as an everyday moisturizer in the winter!) and if you want a real treat, the Timetreasure Sleeping Mask. The next morning, you wake up a new woman üòÜ I buy that with Afterpay, so I&#39;m not breaking the bank.<br>Another Korean brand I LOVE, and starting to like just as much at a smaller pricetag is Primera!! If you haven&#39;t seen a review on them yet, They are great!!<br>I love this review!! Great job",
            "Love this brand. I used to have acne for years and used to use ton of make up to cover it which made my skin just worse. Ever since I started using these products my skin cleared up, my wrinkles are fading away and my face glows. I don‚Äôt use make up anymore other than mascara. This is not cheap but worth every penny.",
            "Hello Alice, I received a kit of Sulhwasoo from my sister in law as gift. She said to use it since it&#39;s a high end beauty product from Korea. You&#39;re right, i had a hard time finding info in Google on how to use it step by step. I&#39;m glad i came across your vlog. I&#39;m finally starting to use their basic products...  I just wanna say it has become my favorite! It&#39;s making my skin look and feel better even if I&#39;m 50. Btw, I&#39;m asian, so probably the result varies from skin type to skin type. Anway, thank u for showing me how.",
            "I had the same kind of issue.. I kept looking through that same reddit thread you mentioned, plus Fiddy and Snow White &amp; the Asian Pear for guidance.. I now make sure to use my chemical exfoliants before the first care activating serum and waiting a bit, just focusing on my cheeks, etc. I used P50 1970 this morning, then the Missha Chogongjin toner and then the first care activating serum. I&#39;m still playing around with how to add in vitamin C alongside my favorite Sulwhasoo products.. The timetreasure eye serum is great, they sell packets on Ebay that are very affordable and you get multiple use out of them. I&#39;d love your thoughts on the Radiant Energy mask. I have it and I enjoy it but for some reason I can&#39;t find a ton about it",

            "I think it is important to be open minded with what we think as set knowledge we think of as correct. Many different ways of doing things turn other knowledge on its head. To me this shows that although alcohol is a major trigger of peoples skin - it is by no means the only ingredient that is damaging  to the skin. How many other ingredients we use in western skin care that have no visible reactions yet we blindly accept and continue to use of when there is not such obvious reactions such as alcohol. It seems in this instance the alcohol is counteracted by the ingredients to work really well and render it harmless. The use and application of science means ingredients are not necessarily always bad - they just haven&#39;t been used in a way that makes them useful and not harmful.",
            "Sulwhasoo gets my skin plump and supple. For some reasons absorption of other products is easier too. I still think we need to mix up active ingredients with herbal range for it to work",

Your review helped alot as this brand is very new to me. But I have a question about whether I can use a moisturiser from a different brand which I normally use in day time. Would it have any reaction with these sulwhasoo products?",
            "Hi. I really like your review. I&#39;m trying out the first care activating serum from sulwhasoo and very surprise when I found out it has alcohol! (from your video...yea...I didn&#39;t read the ingredients too... haha). Alcohol has been a taboo in my skin care routine, but your video change my mind! I have no problem using the serum so far. It&#39;s only been a week, but I can see the difference on my skin. I&#39;m combining sulwhasoo first care activating serum with innisfree whitening pore serum. I&#39;d suggest you to review innisfree product too! Haha. It is from the same big korean company with sulwhasoo (Amore Pacific), but cheaper (to say it in a bold way). It&#39;s as cheap as drugstore product, so I would recommend you trying it out too as a comparison with this &#39;high end&#39; sulwhasoo product. :&quot;) <br>I love your review and am so gonna subscribe. Thanks so much! I am soooo going to try out the clarifying mask. :D",
            "After watching this video, I bought a 90ml of first care activating serum. I receive two sample size of essential balancing water and emulsion. I never saw a serum like this before. It is lightweight and sink into your skin really really fast but very very hydrating.",

You can say whatever you want about it; I&#39;m not horrified by it. :) I have good skin, normal right down the line (slightly oily T-zone, but that&#39;s about it.) I hate to tell you the toners I used to use before toners were a thing. They were mostly alcohol! They were great for removing dirt in the pores, and I didn&#39;t mind a slightly dry skin, because moisturizer took care of it. I was also the chick who was using mud masks eons ago, way before it became a fad. My skin is remarkably good for all that &#39;abuse.&#39; (You know what I think really worked for me not having any appreciable wrinkles? I&#39;ve been a fanatic about wearing sunglasses since I was a teenager. Preferably BIG sunglasses. Not a wrinkle anywhere near my eyes. Who knew?)",

First Care Activating Serum <br>5.  Concentrated Gensing Renewing <br>      Cream<br>Twice a week I have to use the Clarifying Mask and 3x  a week I have to use the Concentrated Gensing Rescue Ampoule. I use this product 2x a day, morning and night. I also have cream for night and for eyes as well. And I also use sulwhasoo sunscreen and foundation as well. <br>I&#39;ve tried a of beauty products but unfortunately it didnt like me at all. The last set i had was oil of Olay, the color purple. I had to toss it  because  it burned my face. So that that day i decided to use Sulwhasoo.  This is the only beauty products that don&#39;t harsh on  my skin as Asian. <br>Bottom line.

She lived in the US, but couldn‚Äôt speak English, and while she was proud of my educational goals, she REALLY, REALLY thought it was important that I focus on my skin, my nails, my hair, and my weight lol. I know she really wanted me to practice my techniques over and over again, as she thought that would guarantee me a man in life. ü§£ <br><br>We would do ‚Äúlessons‚Äù in front of that mirror for hours a week  and I learned how to contour before contouring was even a thing. I knew how to pluck and shape the most perfect eyebrows. I knew how to use eyeshadow to make it appear like I actually had eyelids. <br><br>I have so many hours and so much experience, I could easily  be a hair stylist and a makeup artist. <br><br>My great grandma SWORE by Shiseido products, and they are amazing, and I still use a lot of them today. <br><br>They are very expensive compared to your drug store brands, so I don‚Äôt use them for every part of my face routine. <br><br>There is one product I buy religiously, and I honestly don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs better than cheaper products, but I know it smells just like my great grandma used to so I can‚Äôt stop purchasing it! It‚Äôs $140 for the cream, which is a bit much, but it‚Äôs worth it for the smell and memories!!!",
