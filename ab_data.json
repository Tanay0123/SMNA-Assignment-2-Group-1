I don&#39;t know how this happened to a nice girl like me!!), and have what they say is good skin.  However, I can&#39;t believe how beautifully this foundation went down on my face!!  GORGEOUS!! And, I did not use a lot at all.  The brush is the way to go.  BTW, I used the little sponge applicator to tap on my concealer powder to set.  That also did an excellent job, so don&#39;t toss it --- reuse it!! Thanks for another great video.  Say, could we see you do some makeup on older glamor girls like Gabbi does?? I loved all the Creator videos.",

            "Your seal of approval on a foundation is so important so I really appreciated this video. I wore Tir Tir for the first time today. I’m 78 with dry-combo skin in summer and since I’ve been using Retin A for years, my skin is minimally wrinkled but I have labial and marionette lines around my mouth which foundations love to settle in. The TirTir looked a little makeupy on my forehead, but natural overall. It didn’t settle into lines or wrinkles. It’s tricky to apply though. If you press down enough to get product on the pad, it’s way too much to apply directly to skin. Rubbing the pad on the inside lid and then applying to face will still result in too heavy a coat. I learned to just pick up just the tiniest bit on the pad, then rub on the lid, then press the whole pad on the lid and then apply. I also tried using a damp sponge which I patted on the product left in the lid. Both those techniques gave me a more natural finish. It did last all day but got pretty glowy. I powdered lightly after 5 hours and it looked great. Unfortunately I got 27N and it’s a tad too dark &amp; yellow for my skin tone so I ordered the sample kit from Amazon for less than $2 so I can try some different colors before I order again.",

            "if u press the puff lightly in the foundation or just simply press half the puff on the foundation ever so lightly it will pick very less amount which is actually enough to cover the whole face, u will not need any brush or blender to smooth out...btw thanks for showing in natural light in zoomed in focus",
            "You pressed to many times, one light touch will cover your face and then add a second layer for more coverage. do not press so hard and no more than one dip onto the cushion.",

I understand orange cancels red, apparently, but if your skin is pink, I need it to match , not to cancel. Anyway, I hope those of you who have a shade match enjoy this one.",

            "Tati, have you found that the Vitamin C has an odd scent once it’s been sitting on the skin for awhile? It’s not a perfume or added fragrance, just really weird. I don’t know how to describe it. You’re absolutely correct to the quality of their skincare though. I love the cleansing balm and enzyme cleanser, along with their Niacinamide with Retinol Serum. The milky toner is a bit heavy for me, but the light version is wonderful!",

            "I have no idea why I&#39;ve been resisting the cushions because I LOVE their skincare line. I think the shade match was freaking me out. Got the red cushion mini and nailed the color on the first try. OMG. I don&#39;t know what kind of magic is in this stuff, but it&#39;s amazing. It stays all day without a primer or spray. I don&#39;t want to claw my skin off at the end of the day. It doesn&#39;t settle into pores or lines (I&#39;m in my 50s with drier skin). And I want to buy a million of the minis for my purse. I also think I can get away with the mini in my purse on a plane without having to put it in my liquids bag, which is a huge bonus for me. The fact that it&#39;s $15-$25 depending on size is a huge bonus. I have a graveyard of foundation bottles that I can now get rid of for good. If you&#39;ve been on the fence like me, just try it. So good.",

You just do not know you have makeup on and more affordable than TirTir. <br>But one trick about Tir Tir- I got a much lighter shade for concealer- perfection- under eye lines gone and I’m 75. I do the same with Cinema Secrets.",

            "hi, do you know if the refills fit any compact? i want to buy the red cushion, but i like the pink compact more.",
            "As a dry-combo/normal skin girlie, I am absolutely loving the TirTir Cushion Red (23N Sand) as it feels super secure, and hydrating and is probably a great option for those that have a similar  skin type as I do, who prefer a natural matte finish.<br><br>I bounce around wearing dewy and natural/semi matte foundations depending on season, and I normally wear Haus Labs TriClone Foundation in Light Medium Neutral 210.<br><br>Another thing to note is that the TirTir foundation on first application may look  pale upon first application, but trust the process as this foundation oxidizes pretty beautifully as you get the rest of your makeup done. I was pretty shocked at this at first to be honest. Make sure to also have a great hydrating skin prep before applying, and if you use setting powder, I recommend to opt out in using it as I noticed it adds unnecessary skin texture when I did so. A hydrating setting spray is much better imo.<br><br>My only current gripe with TirTir however is that I cannot seem to find any links or even a functioning official website for refills. I heard that the red cushion foundation is refillable, (could be wrong) and I prefer not purchasing a whole new mirror or puff just for foundation. If anyone knows where I can purchase refills, I’d greatly appreciate it!~🙏❤",

            "Ohh I just bought the black one in the same shade as you (at the insistence of my friend who has really liked this product XD). I&#39;ll have to see how it works for me!",
            "thankyou for keeping it short and straight to the point, I think Ill go with the silver one, Im afraid the red one might be too heavy for me",
            "Do you think that using the primer that goes with the foundation is what prevents the oxidation?",

Tried everything but nothing worked then finally went to a dermatologist and found out it was a hormonal issue. Was put on a medication called Accutane. After the treatment was complete it went away, my skin was cleared and I haven&#39;t had a problem since. It&#39;s been 20 yrs.",
            "The foundation is great.<br>Ditch the red lipstick",
            "1. ALWAYS prep your skin before foundation, you will look fresh and your skin will keep it&#39;s elasticity <br>2. You can still use powder, but apply it LIGHTLY with a brush, it will actually help conceil creases and avoid having foundation and conceiler clogg them even more which creates a cakey look. I use a large loose powder brush and I like translucent powder or very fine and light powders (ex. rice based, etc)<br>3. Maybe look into ph balancing for your skin, korean lines imo have the best, and I think clinique has some good ones too",

I did learn something new watching this video, though, and that was to tap out the product on the underside of the cover.",

            "I can see the difference with the primer side. Not huge but that’s a great primer!!",
            "I got the 35N and it was too dark, but I used it as a contour and to cover the acne scars that are on my cheeks.  I wore this for 17  hours while visiting Savannah, Georgia, which is a very hot and humid place.  I put it on at 9:30AM and removed at around 3AM the next day. First I dabbed the Tirtir on my acne scars. The ease with which this goes on is unbelievable. I then followed with the Bare Minerals powder in my skin tone to set, because of how hot and humid Savannah is. Lastly, I spritzed the Tula Signature Glow Face Mist over my whole face. This foundation looked skin like and was flawless after 17 hours of wear in a hot climate, where I sweated all day as I was out and about touring the city. We ended up at a Taco spot at 2AM and when I went to the ladies room and stared into the mirror, I could not believe how amazing it looked. Its as if it became more skin like as time passed and still covered my scars. What sort of witchcraft is this? <br><br>This is the number one foundation in Japan for a reason. The stuff works. Color matching may be a problem though. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was a 35N or a 40N so I ended up buying both. 40N is really too dark for me, but I&#39;ll repurpose as contour as well.  I&#39;ve ordered the 34N and 33N and am hoping one of these are a match. Tirtir doesnt do a good job showing the colors for matching but the foundation itself is gold.  I don&#39;t see myself using anything else once I find a match.  The stuff is magic, it really is.",
            "I put three fingers through the pad so I get even coverage on the sponge when I dab. I start on the outside of the face and move toward the inside so I don&#39;t get a big glob near the nose.",
            "It actually looks very nice on you!",
            "Amazon sells sample color packs for $1.50, I have the fair and medium sample packs on the way!",
            "Do you wash the cushion ?",
            "Risa, if you watch Robert Welsh’s YouTube video “Why can’t people use this foundation right?”, he explains that we’re supposed to put our index finger and ring finger under the ribbon on the pad, with our middle finger out. He was specific and it was helpful, just in case you want to check that out!?",
            "You might do better with Sand color in Tir Tir.",
            "Hi Risa. You and I share the same oily skin gene and similar skin tone. I purchased the tirtir in the pink packaging and this one was most matte finish of the brand. Even with this formula, I was oily by 6-7 hours in. The veil primer and OS setting spray gave me about an extra hour of wear time. Thank you Risa for being authentic and honest. I can always depend on your reviews for my needs. I’m 50 yo for reference.",
            "I&#39;m wearing it every day and love it!  I live in the humid South!  It doesn&#39;t budge until I take it off.  I have mature combination skin.  I ordered the samples from Amazon and found that Latte was my color.",

            "OMG I love this foundation and I am OILY OILY OILY! I&#39;ve been waiting for you to review this. I think that it&#39;s a  foundation it is formulated for an environment which is HUMID - not like here -- I mean WET AIR! The colors are also the same, I think. Culturally the skin in that part of the world is lighter than here.",
            "I&#39;m 61 and I have bought this product on repeat. I use a makeup brush to apply. It melts into my skin and blends effortlessly. I have gotten compliments on this foundation. I use a primer with all foundations. Thank you for honest content.",
            "Robert Welsh has a great tutorial video as well because you see so right Risa. I bought a much too lighter shade the first time didn’t apply it right but I gave it another shot &amp; bought a better shade now I love it!",
            "I thought it was too dark for you. When you applied the blush, it blended nicely, but your forehead looked off. It did look flawless, though.",
            "I tried it, but got a seriously wrong color - for $24.00, I couldn&#39;t afford to try again.",
            "Risa, I love your reviews as I am 58, have oily/ combo skin and live in a humid Midwest climate (Southern Illinois).  I would love to hear your take on the matte version of this foundation.  Thanks for all you do!🥰",
            "I’m so disappointed in this foundation. I bought 4 different colors on Amazon and they were all yellow on me. The finish is beautiful but they just don’t have a color match for my light-medium neutral to cool skin tone.",
            "I have Lupus, and periodically get a Malar (Butterfly) Rash across both sides of my face. It is very pronounced and I have never found a make-up or even combination of make-ups that will cover it. One application of this Tir Tir foundation covers that rash completely. I even went in to see my dermatologist and rheumatologist to show them, and they were both shocked at the coverage. At 76 years old, this even covers sun spots, hides wrinkles and creases, and I no longer have to use concealer anywhere. And, it&#39;s affordable. Who could ask for anything more???",

            "Hi Risa, I love this foundation, I was getting great coverage but a bit cakey at end of day until I watched MUA Robert Welsh, now I get a natural glass skin look,💕💕  I can use 24w, soft beige and 23n sand because it does oxide a bit.I think 25n is a tad too dark for me.",
            "Please review the black version too. Your review is very helpful.",
            "The sample kit is a good idea if you&#39;re not sure what your shade is, if it will oxidize on you or if you want to see if the formula works for you.",
            "I think perhaps its not so much the foundation,   but the applicator and application process.",
            "Would love to try this foundation but unfortunately Tirtir, like most brands, thinks cool toned means pumpkin orange. I literally don’t understand why NO brands can come up with an actual rosy cool shade. I tried two shades of this and they are literally pumpkin. 32 shades isn’t that innovative or impressive when the shades they create are not inclusive or accurate in any way.",

            "Do you put sunscreen under your primer?",
            "I was in Japan for the past 2 weeks and the store where I purchased the foundation had testers so I swatched several shades before finding the right one. I&#39;m 51 with oily/ combo skin and I just love this foundation. It makes your skin look so beautiful!",
            "Thanks for the review!",
            "You have to be careful applying this  less is more. The pad picks up a lot ! I actually dab it on. Then brush them sponge. Ha",
            "I tried it but it’s too shiny and adding powder made it dry and it wore off. Felt like a cc cream. I like my Nars way better.",
            "Pls order the matte version !!!",
            "23N, great color",
            "I just received this foundation so haven’t tried it yet. I think I will like it with my combo to dry skin. Most foundations are too matte for me.",
            "I think that is little to yellowish and dark for you...I would like to recommend 17c. The one you showed us is still ok tho"

Appreciate you talking openly about your rosacea and the ingredients and details of products that lead to you like them (or not).

I’m quite surprised that a lot of influencers I see online only rave and rave about how good this product is when there are glaring issues with it... made me have trust issues with this brand and the influencers that promote it",

But they reformulated and removed the PGA and added fragrance. I can’t use it any more and was looking for a replacement. This seems to fit the bill!",
            "As someone with combo sensitive rosacea, acne-prone skin I never like any foundations. I need fuller coverage otherwise there&#39;s no point in wearing it and the brands here are so CAKEY! My skin gets irritated, or it moves around, or dries my skin out and flakes off. But my skin loves the TIRTIR foundation. Looks as good at the end of the day as it did when I put it on. Skin doesn&#39;t get angry. I also use their setting spray and their light toner. Happy skin, happy me!",
            "James!!! I just passed both my state board exams here in America and now I’m a licensed esthetician! I just wanted to say that your channel has taught me so much, honestly over the years you’ve taught me more than my own school ever did - I know there are some seriously shitty estheticians out here in the States who don’t care about the education and will do anything for money, including ruining their clients skin. I’ve seen some horrific cases of people purposefully putting their clients at risk with dirty implements or use ingredients their clients have stated they’re allergic to and other terrible things, it’s terrifying. but with my license I’ll always strive to learn as much as possible, always put my clients and their skin health first and use your channel as a resource forever ❤ you’ve helped me grow so much as an esthetician, Robert has helped me too so much (also a newbie makeup artist) and I love you guys. In Welshes we trust is SO accurate! You both are such a great source of information (and endless entertainment and giggles) like I’m so glad I found your channels years ago. You’d have to do some seriously fucked up shit to ever be cancelled to me 😂 thank you for everything you’ve taught me!! I’ll totally be checking out TirTir ❤ Asian beauty brands are so incredible!

I’m 45 combo skin, I’ve been using it for 6 months now (before it even got viral on TikTok and YouTube) and at that time if felt like I had discovered a gem, 🤣 well I guess I’m not the only who thought that. <br>The bad reviews I’ve seen are people who misused the product…it’s really unlike any western foundation products, you really need the tiniest amount, one small press in the cushion and tap excess in the lid and you have enough for the whole face. It’s not building up well once dried either, but it’s so nice coverage I’ve never had the need to « built it up ».",

            "Yes I agree, from the very beginning of you putting it on I already thought the shade was a bit dark and I also agree that there might be others who don&#39;t want such a dewy look so I&#39;m looking forward to what happens when you&#39;ve set it properly",

            "I’ve been using this foundation for the past 5 months. I only use it when I am going out to an event or to an important meeting or an important lunch or dinner. That’s how great it is! I literally save it for better occasions. It goes on flawlessly, if you powder on top of it, it will not crease. And I am 51, my skin does crease and is creapy, and this foundation hides, all of it! It might crease into like our 12 just a little around the marionette lines, but other than that it literally looks flawless. This is the best foundation I have ever used. And my face doesn’t feel dry, it’s still hydrated, even if I put powder on top. It’s literally magic! One hundred percent magic. I’ve purchased like 4 extras just so that I never run out of it.<br>The secret to using this foundation is not to use a brush with it. Use only the sponge and it will literally seal your pores. Your pores will disappear. Nina used to brush which I would never do with this foundation. Especially if you want completely flawless skin. There’s something about the applicator that leaves your skin literally flawless.",

I&#39;m 55 and it does NOT settle into any fine lines or creases like some &quot;creams&quot; can. As of now I will never use any other type of foundation. 🥰<br><br>The biggest thing that some people don&#39;t understand about <i>cushion</i> foundation is that you must use it very sparingly. All you need is a little dab. I&#39;ve had friends try it and hate it. It&#39;s because they end up slapping it on like they do their liquid foundation. If you apply it like that, it&#39;s much too much and too heavy.",

I squeezed the whole sachet out like i do normally with foundation samples, and omg, I could have used that sachet 3-4 times with how much insane coverage it was, you really need to only use a tiny bit compared to other foundations. I had to sponge a lot off. I personally did not like it. I am a dewy BB cream/ light-med coverage person, and this was high coverage matte and cakey so the opposite of what I like.... tried the samples for the hype but it was faaar to heavy for me, glad I did not get the full one, so gave the rest of the samples to friends.

I use the lighter and darker ones to contour and brighten.  This is my #1 foundation for my &quot;mature&quot;, very oily, and acne prone skin. I set in with powder and  if it&#39;s a 10+ hour day, I add setting spray. <br>Love all your videos!!!❤Thank you for your tips, recommendations and tutorials ❤",

            "Elf foundation looks gorgeous",
            "Hi Angie… You need to tap the sponge into the TirTir only once, then work it into the sponge evenly on the back of the plastic lid before applying. Then you get a thinner, more even coat. I’m in my 50’s and it looks great.",
            "I have younger combination skin (no lines no wrinkles, small pores only with a small patch of dark spot).  But I don&#39;t like the Tir Tir cushion either. I think the Tir Tir is overhyped. If you really want to try again, try using with a damp beauty blender but expecting sheer coverage. Using less product with minimal skincare also works too. But I won&#39;t repurchase as there are so many good choices of foundation in the market.",
            "What did you use on your eyelids for this video. So beautiful.",
            "It&#39;s wild how the same product reacts differently on different people. The Tirtir is a freaking DREAM for me. I use a LOT less than Angie did and I&#39;ve found that it performs best with nothing underneath it (no primer or anything else). But again, that&#39;s just on MY skin. Your mileage may vary.",
            "I was hoping to say that you loved it because I&#39;ve been watching you for a while.  I love the Tirtir, its quick application and long wear has me hooked. This is all I use when I travel for work. Tirtir stays put for 8+ hours of travel. In fact, I wore it for 15 hours once, and my skin looked like skin, but better. I was impressed. <br><br>I put the Tirtir on cleansed moisturized skin, set with a powder and then spray it afterwards with the Tula signature glow spray.  I adjust whether I use moisturizer prior to application depending on whether I am headed to the South (warmer no need for a moisturizer, my skin will moisturize itself) or North (colder weather dictates the need for a light moisturizer). <br><br>I think you may have put on too much of the Tirtir. I will look at my skin more closely at the end of the day next time I use it. Now I&#39;m curious.",
            "Totally agree about the Tir Tir. I am 55 and it was sliding around and wearing off. I wore it 2 times. I use EltaMd sunscreen. It separated and looked awful. I haven’t tried Elf yet but will.",
            "I looove Tir tir, BUT would recommend (like Niki La Rose) to use a brush! That way you get less product and don’t end up that cakey. It is so beautiful with way less product",
            "You use about 20 times more TirTir than I use. I’m 63. It’s better if it’s not packed on. You need a light hand as a little goes a long way. You can also use a brush to buff it out. I don’t use it as a full coverage and I don’t need much just to even out and has even replaced my concealer. I will powder my t-zone and eyelids. I love my TirTir and it has replaced my BB creams.",

            "I was tempted to buy the Tirtir foundation but I always struggle with shade selection. I opted for the Elf and it actually looks pretty good on my 66 year old skin",
            "The ELF makes me look greasy after a few hours even after a  light powder set and spray.  And it wore off on my nose.  I will keep trying to work with it but... I am losing patience. Good thing that it is so cheap.",

            "I have both the Tir Tir and the ELF and I love the Tir Tir foundation. However, do NOT apply with the provided sponge. Apply with a foundation brush. It applies perfectly, not too heavy, and gives a  beautiful finish. For reference,  I&#39;m over 50 and have a few wrinkles.",

            "So interesting that on the Elf one, on the non set side, it’s actually more matte and smoother around your eyes, nose and cheeks than the setting powder side",
            "The trick is to use very thin layer like Koreans . Distribute with spatula",
            "Wow the Elf looks great on you but not on me. I’m still searching for my holy grail. The one that worked great for me was the old formula YSL. ☹️",
            "Thank you for this video! I had been thinking about buying the TirTir makeup. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t waste my $$!",
            "Yes  bring back foundation Friday👍😃<br>The Tir Tir did the same to me!   I’m 67 and I think it’s more for younger people😉",
            "Love your content and style! Would love to see full face RMS😊",
            "I am 61 and use tir tir.   I think it&#39;s beautiful.  When I wear it, no concealer is necessary.  A very small amount is needed for great coverage that lasts all day.",
            "thank you for this video!",
            "I am 52...with deep wrinkles on my forehead and big pores. I also have very oily skin. It covered up all my imperfections and did not settle in my wrinkles. I applied it with the sponge only on my cheeks and forehead and then used my beauty blender to spread it out. Use the Tir Tir makeup setting spray, lightly powered only in the t zone, and it stayed on ALL DAY. I bought the color swatches for $1.50 to get the correct color.",
            "This is my holy grail right now, I absolutely love this foundation. I was hoping you would do a test with it. Thank you!",
            "So I finally received my TirTir foundation order.  I watched this video before it arrived and worried that I made a mistake buying it.  I didn’t know it was even popular on Tiktok but wanted to try the Korean makeup.  I’m happy to say I love it.  I think the key is to make sure you apply a thin layer and spread it out.  Putting on too much will make it look very makeup-y.  I have dry skin and I didn’t experience cracking on my dry areas.  I’ve worn it twice and it’s a new favorite.  I only bought the smaller size to try it first.  I bet it will last me a long time since a small amount goes a long way.  It will definitely be great for traveling.",

            "Totally agree with your critique of TirTir.",
            "I wanted to love the TirTir so much. I love the coverage in such a thin formula, but it does get very shiny throughout the day and the Asian sunscreen in it made me break out so terribly. I just tried the new Huda blur foundation and returned it. It gets super shiny, separates, crackles on my skin, and settles into every line.",
            "I use Tir Tir and know you didn&#39;t like it because you used too much.",
            "I use the tir tir as concealer under my eyes. I have more veins than darkness to cover. Looks so much better than any concealer I’ve tried. However, not as much coverage. No natural",

            "Thank you so much for this review!  The daylight shots were wonderful.  Now I can take this off my wish list ❤",
            "I’ve also tried both and fully agree with the result. I find using a luminous spf, the Elf putty primer with the Elf satin foundation works best for me. It wears off naturally. My first purchase of Tirtir was the smaller version that was too light. I ended up using it as a concealer. I don’t recommend Tirtir."

            "Watch Robert Welsh’s video on how to apply this foundation. You’re supposed to press the sponge into the compact once, tap off the excess on the inside of the black cover, and then pat it on. The thing with the sponge is it picks up A LOT of foundation, and it will stay in there (what doesn’t end up on your face). It’s not like a beauty blender. One or two presses into the compact will cover your whole face. It is supposed to be a very light application at first, and if you want to build on it, you can. But if it goes on too heavy, it will oxidize. 45 W was too red for me (I use 43 N), but that was perfect on you!",

            "I just saw a cooment on the red cushion which said that it oxidizes and turns orange when people put on too much product.  Apparently you&#39;re supposed to light press the cushion into the foundation and dab it onto your entire face - a little goes a looong way.",
            "I am a cabin crew, and I have the red cushion. I have been wearing it with the ceramic ampoule and it simply is CRAZY. After working for 12 hours inside an aircraft, the foundation was still FLAWLESS. With the ampoule, it finishes more glowy, and I simply adore it. It has so much coverage that I need only the smallest amount to cover a pretty big surface of skin. I absolutely recommend it!",
            "😂i live in Seoul and i didn&#39;t know about Tirtir till recent.  I don&#39;t use cushion, but i will try their eyecream and other skin care after seeing this review. Korean companies are very aggressive in viral marketing. All in all Tirtir publicity will lead more Korean companies to expand their products to try include everyone. About time!🎉🎉",

            "I don&#39;t know why People are so concerned with what others get from brands. Everybody complaining about it really just sounds envious and petty. If a brand decides that an influencer Deserves getting a bag from them  that&#39;s their choice, It does not reflect on their product. Is the product good then buy, If  the product sucks, don&#39;t buy it. People with no money are very quick to judge people with money. It&#39;s their money. They&#39;re allowed to do whatever they want with it.If we had the money to blow on purses, i&#39;m sure we would hate for other people to tell us no, don&#39;t buy a purse donated to charity instead. And if they do donate to a charity, the next stop is gonna be no, not that charity we don&#39;t agree with that charity Pick a different one.",

You have a beautiful face but<br>You are starting out with too much oily grease on your face.<br>Why? Oil and high shine like that do not equal youth and natural looking. It seems this is your look on all your videos.<br>You are beautiful but the oily shine is distracting.<br>I can&#39;t get behind that under makeup. At night yes! But definitely no under makeup <br>It also leads to people over powdering and looking older and craggy<br><br>This can also lead to foundation slipping off your skin. Also can lead to product roll up...and development into other colors.<br>Moisture is one thing and grease is another. <br>As for the birkin bags for influencers...<br>I don&#39;t care. They are advertising for the product they made famous so why not get a perk..that doesn&#39;t mean the influencer should lie about it. They need to keep their integrity. <br>Either way. I don&#39;t follow influencers. I still make up my own mind.<br>I try so many products...if they work...I will buy it.  <br>As long as there is no animal or human cruelty or carcinogenic or  harmful ingredients...I am good<br>Make up your own mind. <br>Don&#39;t follow what people say.",
            "Alice I have recently started using Tirtir ampule and I feel like it is finally THE product for my dry face. Even though it is summer where I am, I am so happy with how thick and gummy it is! I had no idea I needed this. It almost seals my skin, it so wonderfully protective. I watched another review of this ampule by Kelly Driscoll who said it is too heavy. And I think this is really NOT for combination skin types. Just don&#39;t buy it if you have combination, normal or oily skin. I am excited to start using the toner and cream as soon as they arrive.",

            "Even though it&#39;s great that tirtir offers a huge shade range, but some of the shade just seems way off. For example, I have used at least 6 different korean brands of the cushion foundation of shade 23W. Though the undertone all differs slightly between the brand, but I find tirtir to be way off (very orange, and the shade one shade up/down also off). In addition, their formula seems to oxidize ALOT more than the others (even with primer).  As amazing as their coverage &amp; longevity is, i am not that impressed.",
            "Love the drawl at the end of some of your words!!! Such a unique way of speaking!!! Cute as can be!!!",

            "I&#39;m late to the comments, but I have to say I absolutely love their skin care. I saw it reviewed by someone who purchased it with their own money, who absolutely loved it. <br>Since she doesn&#39;t do sponsored videos and  has never steered me wrong (she hated the foundation) I purchased it.  It is amazing on my dry aged skin.",

            "I have VERY DRY SKIN,, I hope it works with the foundation ???",
            "i know as a westerner it sounds weird for a brands mission to be merging science and nature (haven&#39;t we heard it a million times before from western brands who legitimately don&#39;t even try to live up to the statement - see insert essential plant oild at bottom of ingredients list) so i definitely get it sounds odd. however if you look at it through the lens of Korean culture and how Koreans developed their skin care, their influences etc, i think it does make sense. Koreans are really big on Hanbang skin care, which is skincare methods and formulas derived straight from ingredients found in nature (mugwort and centella are two pretty big ones and popular atm) - a brand that does this really well and that has really had a chance to solidify it&#39;s identity with that is BOJ. but if you look at most popular Korean skincare brands, they are inspired by the same history and have similar approaches to using the power of ingredients derived from natural sources. i think maybe tirtir is a bit more hesitant to really embrace the Korean terminology and history too strongly here in-case it alienates their international customer base (and remember they did start out with make up and that seems to be their main focus) so they went with a purpose statement that was a bit more appealing or easier for a wide range of cultures and people to grasp but they also lost a little bit of what makes K skincare special in the first place by doing that. i think they really could do awesome things with their skincare products if they follow a little more in BOJ&#39;s footsteps and really embrace their Korean identity in and international capacity a bit more.",
            "Wow your skin looks amazing! What an improvement",
            "Did you try the Tir Tir pure vitamin C 24 serum?",
            "When it comes to the bag, my first thought was about korean culture. One of best friends is korean and when she came to visit me, she got gifts for her family and the monotary value was the most important aspect. The gift needed to be a recognized luxery brand. It was weird as an american who grew up on the phrase &quot;its the thought that counts&quot; but thats just culture. I really think the birkin controversy is just a big cultural misunderstanding (they they hopefully learned from)",
            "A few notes on some of the side elements discussing the brand. First this brand isn&#39;t commonly seen in cosmetics stores in Seoul. Having recently been there I saw no stores I could find aside from something I saw on Google maps in Gangnam that didn&#39;t appear to exist in person. I saw tons of cosmetics stores, but only 1-2 had TirTir products and it was a very trimmed down selection smaller than what I&#39;ve seen here other than the cushion that I saw in a few places. In Japan I actually saw a pop-up, but it was closed for a private event (possibly exclusive).<br><br>As far as the culture, I can&#39;t speak that much from a one day visit, but the marketing in S. Korea seemed far more focused on unattainable perfection. I saw a picture of a shirtless photoshopped guy with 8-pack abs to sell glasses (not sunglasses, the ones to help you actually see). The luxury culture seems baked in, but only to a specific subset of the population, and there are entire markets devoted to &quot;luxury&quot; goods that are really just fakes for $20-40. Having also seen Japan that actually feels like it has a stronger luxury brand culture, I just feel its less in your face than the brand focus portions of Seoul that can almost be equated to portions of LA.",
            "Yes - it’s so frustrating that we send billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars to other countries(notably Israel)  who are committing genocide with our money! Millennial here- and never felt so depressed and disaffected by our government. Never.",
            "I tried most of the skincare line. I think it’s very good for the most part and especially at the price point. I just started using it so I could change my mind.",
            "There really are no results to gain here…..the only changes in your skin…will come from constant deliberate actives…..these are just hydrating…you will not Gabe any amazing changes….",
            "I&#39;ma try that ceramic ampoule come winter! So glad they have mini sizes though, like you said, many plant ingredients may offer more risks.",
            "They are releasing even more shades of the red cushion next month!",
            "Alice they reformulated the Benton ferment eye cream . I was just looking at it thinking I need to repurchase it because I loved it so much and I see they have a new and old version, idk how I feel I&#39;m going to have to buy and try and hope it feels exactly the same I mean they added a bunch of peptides, ingredients list looks good I just hope it feels the same .   I also got the HuruHaru wonder phyto and 5 peptides cream Numberzine number 1 toner and a few other things . O Amazon has the Haru wonder EGF serum u like back for like 22.97 and the that cream I got was 13.97 on sale so I got it from their and it will be here tomorrow gotta love 1 day shipping . 13.97 for a peptide cream lol seems unheard of and if I don&#39;t like it I can use it on my body . I still need to make a stylevanaa order I have a list of stuff I want .",
            "After seeing this, I looked for the Mikayla-Tirtir-Birkin video. From what I understand, they gave the bag AFTER her video that went viral. I don’t follow or support Mikayla because I’m not a makeup girlie, but I was hoping to get into tirtir skincare. Maybe it was purely a gift? She looked genuinely shocked when she got the bag. That’s how I saw it. Anyway, I truly appreciate you Alice. Thanks for staying genuine. Maybe I’ll still give tirtir a chance. I dunno 🤷‍♀️ I’m not super mad because I don’t want a birkin lol",
            "The gift debacle has left me totally disinterested in this brand unfortunately but I appreciate the review and discourse! 💗",
            "I got something for u to try , I still need to purchase it but I&#39;m intrigued it sounds nice and up dry skin alley its the Nacific Uyu milk ampoule idk it sounds nice and not super expensive like 18$ . I was intrigued to try this brand till the whole Berkin Bag thing and the gifting major expensive stuff to influencers . It feels wrong.",
            "Idk who Makeyla is but TirTir needs to READ THE ROOM. Why are they gifting anything but their products to an influencer??? No matter how Korea is about luxury items this doesn&#39;t sit right with me.(they indeed are obsessed, young ppl are going broke and/or get loans just to buy a Chanel bag..wtf).",

I’ve landed on mocha and then I wore it and I felt like it was way too light for my skin now I’m confused on which color again, and I’m not sure if I like the way it wears but the correct shade could change my mind.",
            "I also bought the shade trial kits, too. It was very difficult to guess online. Unfortunately, I did not find a perfect match either. Too many &quot;neutral&quot; shades and some were looking warm or orange! I am currently medium tanned skin with warm undertones. 27C looked like my winter shade as it was a little warmer than expected but slightly neutral, however still got a good match. So my current summer shade is 27C &amp; 33W mixed together. My winter shade could be 27C &amp; 30N mixed. 30N was very orange! I use Nars barcelona foundation, ginger/biscuit concealer, Huda Beauty tres leches foundation, granola concealer, Estee Lauder fawn/cashew foundation, 3w/4w concealer shades for reference if anyone is struggling finding their Tirtir shade.",

As long as I use some bronzer on the perimeter of my face, it actually balances it out and looks very natural. I’ve been experimenting with it for a couple weeks and I found that NONE of my setting powders work with this foundation. It ends up looking super cakey or separating.  It’s better to not set it with powder.",

There are no shades for medium-dark tones and most shades don’t have good undertones so only a select amount of people can use them even with 30 shades. There aren’t shades for people who aren’t very dark or light tanned to pale. The oxidisation is horrible and you have no cool shades for “medium dark” so when it oxidises, it goes orange. This still isn’t a good shade range when it’s either pale shades, light medium shades or 3-4 very dark shades. That’s not shade range, that’s just lots of different foundations that could fit certain people, like 2-3 shades in each range is the same and fits a bunch of people. This is what I noticed when I bought the testers and tried different shades (regrettably) such a shame because the formula is really nice.",

FYI, I do one medium strength tap, then very lightly tap around my whole face. Then I have less on the cushion, and I go around and push it in. One full tap is very sufficient for full-coverage.

I use one called UKLash and I’ve noticed the skin getting darker along my lash line so maybe the all do it. I am 55 and my Mum is 81.

You need to take care of that. I solve such moments with lactic acid products. Nevertheless technique is super important. I didn&#39;t like my first cushion first. But when I gave it a chance, I learned how to use it. And pay attention to the skin type is it for. It matters. Less is more with cushions. And another thing that works for me - no primer, just hydrate. That&#39;s it.",

A lot of people in the comments are talking about how long cushions have been out and how everyone should just know how to use them, but there&#39;s a first time for everyone.

I bought the tir tir because I’ve been trying to find a full coverage that works well with my 37 year old skin. I liked the look of it but it felt sticky once it dried down. I didn’t really load the sponge up but I may try it again and  try to be even lighter handed to see if that makes a difference because I haven’t really seen anyone say it makes their face feel sticky besides me. I also shouldn’t really wear powder since my face lacks moisture but if I can’t get it to not be sticky then I don’t know what else to do with it.",

The Lancome cushion was quick to apply and so lightweight. It felt like I had nothing on my face. I got full even coverage each time I used it. People should really learn to use stuff before they hate it. There&#39;s always a reasoning behind why a cosmetic company&#39;s R&amp;D department would put in a lot of time,effort, and money to create a product. Gosh.",

I have combination skin &amp; deep acne scars on my cheeks so applying foundation sometimes drives me insane since I cannot predict how my skin will act that day 🥲 I recently purchased this tirtir cushion, my favorite way to apply this is by using the puff that came with it, trying my best to pat the foundation (thin amount), then finish blending it with a beauty blender",

            "Shelly, you&#39;re always my go-to girl on foundations past and foundations present. It’s not only your great testing and review, but I used to have very dark brown hair (almost black) and fair skin like yours, and a bit on the dry side. I wear cool tones as well. Whichever  color you chose, I know exactly what to choose. I have to say, while looking at the swatches online, with 3 cool colors preceding it, I would never have chosen 21C. There was a gal on YT who happened to be an albino, who tested the the lightest color at the time, which was 15C, and it has orange, orange, orange! I Googled their color charts and then said, &quot;Screw it! I&#39;m going to go over and see what Shelley has to say!!&quot; And viola!!!  21C it is!",

            "Shelly, I’m binge watching your channel today. Tirtir looks fantastic on you. I wear the shade Vanilla and love it. Like you, I don’t use the sponge that’s included. I have to be comfortable applying makeup and I prefer a brush or damp sponge. Love the completed look. So look forward to seeing a visit from Ziva!",
            "Hi Shelly, after this review, I ordered the foundation on Yesstyle for only £16. It took ages to arrive, but I was excited when I got it, in shade 23N, sand.<br>I was annoyed, because it looked so dark and orange, but I had to try it on. As I was applying it, it made me look orange; to be fair more peach than orange.<br>And then something happened. After 10 minutes or so, I looked at my face, and lo and behold, no more orangey face, just my real skin colour, light neutral, slightly cool. This was the reverse of oxidation!!!?<br>By the way, according to some reviews, I pressed the puff very lightly against the sponge and then tapped it on my face in a few places, as you would with a standard foundation, and then spread it all over with my hands. But if I would use more product, I would have spread it with a brush.<br>As you have demonstrated, the foundation stays put and beautiful all day, well at least for 10 hours.<br>The price if this foundation on Yesstyle varies all the time, but it is very reasonable for what it is. I would say US$20 or around £16 in the UK.",
            "I suffer from redness in my face from god knows what - when I talk, get excited whatever else.. it’s so weird. I know it’s not rosecia. I went to get a facial from someone who basically put 1 mask on my face, left for 20 minutes, came back, did another mask and came back in 10 minutes- that was the facial. $60! Then she had the nerve to tell me I have rosecia. I was so mad. I am 45 years old, I would know by now if I had it or not. I just have very sensitive skin. Plus I am very pale redhead with green eyes that’s why my skin is such a nightmare. <br>Anyways, I just wanted to share that with you because I understand what you meant.",
            "I didn’t notice any smell🤷🏼‍♀️. Also you should use the applicator which is designed for that purpose and uses far less product when done properly. But having said that I think it looked great on you. I love it, so far 😳😳🤣",
            "Love your look! Does this oxidise at all? Also did u set it with powder?❤❤❤",

I was especially eager for &quot;swatch time!&quot; since I wear the same shades as you and have all the same foundations you normally compare to. Ordering online is intimidating but I ordered 21C and  wore it today...all I can say is WOW!! My makeup looked exactly the same at 9pm as when I put it on at 9am this morning - maybe even better since it melded with my skin. You are such a joy to watch and I really appreciate you❤",

            "For the love of all things holy please learn to use this foundation correctly when providing a review and feedback. Too often individuals reviewing this foundation goes straight into it and applied directly to their face. That is not how you apply this foundation. You dip the applicator into the product and then pat off the excess on the back of the lid. Then apply when you apply this product in the manner that she is applying it you end up with a substantial amount of product on your face that should not be there with correct application. The amount of product that was placed on her face during this review was enough product for two weeks of every day whereas it was not applied correctly. So please prior to giving a review do your homework and provide feedback based upon application.",

But it&#39;s the effort of the company that counts whereas other Korean companies who sell in overseas markets where dark people live in do not have even this many shades. However, I would like to try this in store before buying and hope your brand collabs with sephora or mecca to sell them in their stores. I hope you expand your other cushions as well.",

            "Hi Glamfam! Happy National Asian Heritage month to all my Asian Glamfam sisters! Representing my daddy&#39;s (Japanese) side it was fun to honor an asian owned brand and to personally know how popular this is in Japan! Avorie was able to tell me that it&#39;s literally everywhere in Japan that she goes! Many others read the claims and talking points on how this is #1 seller in Japan but we personally know someone to witness that and give us that feedback which is awesome! Avorie knew about this well before social media made it popular and sorry it took me so long Amber to review this!   I hope to someday be able to visit Japan! 🇯🇵 This blew up on Tiktok and thanks to the incredible asian influencers on that platform and the  amazing and talented Robert Welsh on YouTube! Then every other big influencer jumped on and spread the word TirTir even more!! Putting this K-beauty brand on the map!  But being an Asian YouTuber (over 46),  it was fun to review this from my perspective and hopefully help others make a decision on whether this was right for them! I will give you my update below on how often I use this. Also Regina and Amber both bought this on YesStyle ➤<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+rU8FkxolQYJd2_WkUpkmag\">https://rstyle.me/+rU8FkxolQYJd2_WkUpkmag</a> and you can get a sample for like a $1 so maybe try that first but always remember Amazon returns quite easy if you can find your shade prime that&#39;s the tricky part! <br><br>Update:<br>I don&#39;t wear full coverage foundations on a normal basis and I personally still love my Maybelline skin plus vitamin c the most and then Surratt for special occasions but sometimes I will use this more as a spot conceal and like that better than concealer! I do use this very sparingly but for the purpose of trying this video I used a lot! So my recommendation moving forward is go more sparingly especially with mature skin and that is a bit easier sometime with a brush and then sponge to blend out. I will play with this more in real life and maybe even on another video.I will probably have to up the shade to 24w if I get tanned more during the summer months! I may buy that sample just to test out other shades. ❤",
            "See I thought that the sponge that they gave us in the compact worked extremely well I mean it doesn&#39;t soak up any of the foundation at all it&#39;s kind of cool😊 And the key to that too is tap tap tap a lot of people that I have seen it&#39;s like there rubbing it in or doing circular motions 🤷😮",
            "Kristi I wish you would please ask your friend about the red cushion foundation If they&#39;re going to make any REFILLS  I&#39;ve bought several of the compacts and I really don&#39;t want to keep buying them over and over!! Need asap😊",
            "Did you say 46? 😮 we’re same age, and I do think we are quite young, but honestly, you look 32 top. I’m really loving your videos, you communicate in a very professional and effective way! I’m already a fan! Hugs from Brazil!",
            "Oh I finally ordered one! Thank you for your review! ❤️🙌🏼❤️",
            "Good news is that they now have 30 shades",
            "Nice review 🎉😊",
            "When you said Amani was your favorite frishion foundation; I knew I came to the right Channel! Coz you have high expectations!!!!",
            "My daughter tried this foundation and said it wore off at her nose. I was thinking I might give it a try but then I looked in my drawer and saw how many foundations I need to use up ….. 😂😂…. Decided to wait for a while.  Thank you for the review!  I will circle back and watch it again when I decide to try it! ❤❤",
            "New to your channel and I enjoyed your thorough review! When you used the sponge to apply, was it damp? Also, when you added a primer, was it water-based or silicone-based? I bought Tirtir in sand color and it’s too dark and orange. Is there any way I can lighten it so that I don’t waste it? Thanks!",
            "I got mine! I LOVE IT! I’m 54 and it looks FLAWLESS. SHADE 23n sand is perfect.",
            "OMG we&#39;re the same! I got the 17c by mistake and I&#39;m paler than you but my husband kept telling me I look deceased after I first tried on the 17c 😂😂😂<br>I really need the 21w and will use the 17c as concealer as well",

            "Way too heavy handed. If you need to be pouncing a beauty blender you’ve applied too much.",

            "💕💄",
            "I’ll have to check this out!",
            "❤❤loved the birthday shout out! I’ve been using this quite a while and it’s a good addition to my cushion collection. I always use the puffs in cushions and I clean them. It presses the product into the skin to make it that much better.",
            "Oh! And it&#39;s in 30 shades now!! They just released 10 more shades. I&#39;m sad bc my preferred shade is 24w and it&#39;s the only one not on Amazon. Lame. Lol",
            "I&#39;m hearing from two of our Glamfam sisters in the comments the audio is too low. Was so concerned because it sounded completely normal and had to actually  turn down my volume lol but wanted to make sure others weren&#39;t having issues. I tested it on all my devices at home (laptops, iPads and cellphones) and no issues. Had other family and friends try and it was fine for them as well. If you&#39;re having issues so sorry but I&#39;m not sure why. Maybe (and sometimes this happens to me) but the volume on the YouTube screen is down so try increasing that. There&#39;s a little icon that shows volume on the video and you can adjust that. Hope that helps! 😘",
            "Audio is fine Kristi. Tested on our devices and had no issues. Thank you for the review. ❤",
            "I just asked my kids to try it on their random devices and my ex who’s here on his android and we are all ok w the audio on our end 👍😊 maybe it’s a random you tube issue on you tubes side? I’m not sure how stuff like this works 😊🤓🥸🙃",
            "Robert Welsh recently posted a really good video on how to apply cushion foundation properly!! The most common mistake I see is the puff going from the cushion straight to the face. Use the palette (inner cover) to even out the foundation on your puff, and to get rid of excess product. This will allow you to apply a thin, even layer",
            "I’m going to try this, looking beautiful Kristi ❤",
            "Kristi!! Why is the audio so quiet?? I&#39;m excited to watch it anyway, i just wish I could hear you!",
            "Omgosh 💕💕🥳🥳🥰 we had so much fun watching this together! Thank you for trying this out, Kristi! 😊😊",
            "Bestie!! Great review! I heard a lot of about this foundation. For those that want to shade match yesstyle and Stylevana sells a sachet kit with 9 shades to color match for only $1. Hope you are having a wonderful weekend so far twinsie. Love you lots ❤",
            "Hii! Thank you so much for including me in the video. In Japan you find this product everywhere you turn. I hope all your watchers like this product like me and my mom do! (: <br>Keep up the amazing reviews ^-^",
            "Pleased you tested nars. Tbh I&#39;m into high end, do you test la mer,  suqqu etc I&#39;m a new subscriber edit I&#39;ll try this one 😊",
            "Tati reviewed this then it BLEW UP!!",
            "Hi friend ❤ I ordered the sample pack for $1.80 that way I could Play around with a lot of shades to see which color I was, they sent me like 12 so that was really good. That was on Amazon.<br>Unfortunately this did not work for me, it ended up looking patchy on me after just a few hours. I didn’t like the way the formula felt either.<br>I’m glad it worked for you tho.",

However, I really enjoyed seeing how you deconstructed how cushions work and making your own.  I do wonder why the cushion compact you bought didn’t come with the sponge and puff.  Seems like it should have been a little kit with all three parts.",

            "I tried the TirTir a few days ago and did not like it.  I watched multiple YouTube videos on the application process so that wasn&#39;t an issue for me.  It oxidized on me quickly and I found it just too dewy looking for me.  I returned it. I will, however, try making my own cushion foundation which I never knew could be done.",
            "TirTir did not work<br>For me.  It was patchy and didn’t  absorb into my skin.   Worst foundation I ever tried.  I use Maybelline and Loreal True Match skin tint. Both work great for me❤️",
            "Most people use the cushion incorrectly.  They really press the cushion much too hard and get way too much on it and then press it too aggressively on the face.  A very light tap on the cushion and a very light tap on the face.  It is meant to be sheer and skin like.  It can be buildable if you want a more dense foundation.  Too much though can end up creasing in places.",
            "I never knew of this. Thanks for sharing!",
            "Wow. I never realized I could make my own cushion foundation! I also love my Catrice HD. I can golf 18 holes, in the heat, and it still looks good when I get home.",
            "Great ideas, in fact I purchased and use this because of you from a couple years ago! It works wonderfully -  (plus the glass palette for mixing)  You have the best ideas - so thank you!!! :)",
            "Years ago (MANY years ago), I úsed to wear the Max Factor Whipped Creme cushion formula. They only made it for a few years, and I stopped looking for a substitute as O developed rosacea and thought the foundation might have been a contributing cause for redness and rough patches. I remember the Max Factor was pretty heavily fragranced, so maybe this was the problem. But I have so many base-type products going right now, I&#39;ll probably wait until fall/winter to explore other formulas. Thanks for the video anyway! It&#39;s always good to see you looking so good!",
            "I love the DIY aspect of this 💙💛❤💚💜",
            "Big fan of cushion foundation. Tried alot of different ones, and the tirtir oxidizes too much for me (at least 2 shades darker by mid day).  It is always difficult to find a good match so I can see the value of putting your own foundation in a empty cushion.  I havent had great luck of doing that either but maybe just need to keep trying,"

Beautiful buildable coverage, soft sheen, lasts all day, looks fresh at the end of the day and not transferable if lightly set with translucent setting powder.

            "I think this is the most gorgeous I&#39;ve ever seen you look. That foundation should be your holy grail!!",

Never really thought about that until this TirTir video. <br>I’ve been on a “pink” setting powder kick lately (O/S and Givenchy)so I haven’t really paid much attention to other brands… but, definitely trying Haus Labs!!!

I’m happily surprised you were able to build it up without looking cakey, I will have to give it another try to retouch it that way because when I tried it wasn’t pretty.<br>When you mentioned my YouTube name I realized it was not my best idea to leave it as my business name 😅(I use my business google account to access YouTube)  let me properly introduce myself:) my name is Marylene, I’m Canadian just like you but from the French side, Montreal, QC ;) I’ve been living in Dubai for 5 years now, so I’ve had to adjust my makeup application quite a bit for the climate here. Tirtir is definitely a safe bet for a full glam long wear daytime or nighttime look and it photographs well. My other go to long wear for a more natural lightweight look (also perfect on vacations in warm climate) is the underrated Beautyblender bounce always on radiant, looks like skin and yet stays put in the heat of Dubai even on my combo skin, I’m light 5 when I have a tan or light 4 in the summer (summer here we stay indoors so no tan or sometimes fake tan). <br>Looking forward to more of you here on YouTube, in an online world of a lot of « fake » you are a breath of fresh air ❤ Have a lovely day!",

Althoughhhh the have a glow cushion and baby face cushion( I hope I remembered correctly). Have you watched Nikki La Rose’s review of TirTir?  Anyhoo, you looked gorgeous. Loved the eyeshadows your wearing also. I so much wanted to be able to use Lumify, but my Optometrist told me absolutely No. said it can cause a great deal of inflammation with long term use. So good to see you again on video format. Have a great week sweetie.",

            "Wow Julie it&#39;s beautiful! I liked mine the first time I used it even though I used a little too much. I was wondering about it settling in my forehead wrinkles. Now that I saw this, I&#39;m going to try again and be more careful. I liked the color I picked too. I love how you did a little touch up too!! Thank you so much for sharing your talent. I never answered your question from last week. We&#39;re planning to move for my hubby&#39;s work &amp; his family lives there &amp; my family in orange county will be much closer. Vegas has everything! I can&#39;t wait to go shopping. I&#39;ve been there a hundred times! It&#39;s a lot of fun and where we&#39;ll be living is in Boulder Nevada it&#39;s away from the city and by a lake. We have a boat we like to use a lot. So we like small lake towns to live in. We&#39;re in the Bay area now along the California Delta River. It&#39;s called Oakley. Lots of farmers and boat people. It&#39;s quiet and nice. So that&#39;s our plan. We&#39;re doing upgrades on our house now so we can enjoy it while we can before we sell. I hope you&#39;re getting offers on your house and that your new house comes together nicely. I&#39;m so happy for you! I hope your health is doing well. I know it&#39;s a lot. I hate it. I wear oxygen 24/7 &amp; it&#39;s so hard to keep makeup on cuz a rubs off in certain areas. Frustrating!!! I use primers, sprays, powders etc. <br>I hope you are feeling better after your tests and that the doctors will find a way to help you. I just hope you&#39;re ok. I&#39;m doing ok. Lots of pain, weakness, stomach problems like crazy, auto immune diseases it&#39;s a lot. But we keep going cuz we know it&#39;ll get better. Good days are the best!

            "I really like Sulwhasoo and yeah I basically just buy minis from Stylevana sometimes in the 50% off weekly sales. Of note, the timetreasure line is being discontinued (or has already been discontinued) and replaced by the &quot;S&quot; line as per the flagship store in Seoul. Not entirely ideal since their creamy cleanser doesn&#39;t seem to have a replacement, but as long as the Amorepacific one stays I&#39;m good to go. Speaking of Amorepacific, Sulwhasoo is owned by AmorePacific and aside from fragrance and the focus on ginseng the products are very similar so if you&#39;ve tried one and are wondering about the other you probably have a good idea of your first impression. As far as specifics, the activating serum and toners are interesting for me in that I don&#39;t like them unless I have multiple toner steps in my routine. I think this mitigates some of the heavy alcohol implications (specifically with product absorption) which works for my routine but isn&#39;t necessarily a net positive. I&#39;m with you on cleansing products they were fine, even good, but not my holy grails and I do feel the moisturizer line you referenced are my favorite products. The remaining serums are also very high performing skin supplements, but they just can&#39;t do what a tret or l-ascorbic acid will achieve.<br><br>End of the day, I can get 50ml of moisturizer for $40 or less and full amounts of serums for $50-60 or less by buying the samples. To me the value is there, but it&#39;s on each individual to determine whether its how they can an want to spend their money",
            "I&#39;ve used quite a few products from this brand, and I think it&#39;s even worse than HERA. They&#39;re either too heavy or have no effect at all",
            "I just loved all Sulwhasoo product as been using it since 18 years &amp; has changed the texture of my skin👌the ginseng smell so divine just loved it💕👌😍",

            "Alice, are you planning a comparecent video between Donginbi vs. Sulwhasoo? I think Donginbi&#39;s inci list is better what do you think🤔 also which is too parfumed? And the resurch and red ginseng formulationes....etc. if you feel like making one Im up for it🥰🤩",
            "Is this product good on sensitive skin?",
            "Remember asking exactly for this vid :3 Thanks you so much for making it!  <br>P.S. you didn&#39;t find any differences in the effects/texture/smell/etc between full size and minis, right? :&gt;",
            "😆 I&#39;m always dropping things.  I popped my pinky out of the socket this week.  Don&#39;t realize how helpful those things are until they aren&#39;t working at 100%.  Last night, I tried to put my moisturizer back up on it&#39;s little shelf and it ended up in the sink.  Thank goodness for plastic packaging!",
            "Love the SW quote. From my point of view, minis are evil! 😂<br><br>I really want to try this brand but I&#39;m apprehensive because the risk vs reward seems too high for me with my poor wallet and sensitive skin 😅<br>I love ginseng and would love to see more recommendations.",

            "I do still love the overnight mask used as a moisturiser. I liked the ginseng moisturiser better before the reformulation (when I think it included some retinol), but probably just have to shift over to the classic cream.",
            "Thanks Alice for this timely video! I just treated myself to a Sulwhasoo Mini Set from Sephora Rewards for 500 points. I really did notice a difference after one PM use. I am 42 years old, so I will definitely be snagging some more First Aid minis on my next yes or style order!",

And its been years since i last time scraped my nose. After i put on skincare and started to watch youtube videos, i heard that you were saying that you did too...😄😶‍🌫",
            "Don&#39;t mind me, just commenting for the algorithm",
            "It&#39;s funny you say that you scraped your nose... I got a nail caught on my chin while  I was half asleep a few days ago and then trimmed my nails just to nic my ear doing my hair a day or two later. Craziness 😅 Hope it heals fast. ❤",
            "Did you know that your videos come up in the mornings here in Europe? It’s fantastic so I can do my skin care routine and my coffee while listening to these reviews 😄",
            "I adore minis due to having a poor attention span and I get bored too easily 😂.  ps my cat isn’t my friend now I’ve put my samples on my face!! So if you love kitty cuddles, id avoid!",
            "I&#39;ve tried Sulwhasoo based on one of your review videos, and was obsessed with the brand! I&#39;ve tried the mini Ultimate S cream (purchased it during Black Friday). Honestly, I think it feels nice but for the price, I prefer the concentrated ginseng more because of the scent and price. The Ultimate S cream had more of a subtle fruit/floral fragrance compared to the earthy scent. However, it doesn&#39;t go on heavy which is great for those who prefer something light but I can&#39;t say how effective it is for drier skin types.   <br><br>Great video as always, Alice! I would love to see an updated video on your &quot;Ginseng for skin&quot; review one day!",
            "Hi Alice, have you tried the Ginseng Brightening Serum by any chance?",
            "Your hair is EVERYTHING",
            "Yay Sulwhasoo!  Its still one of the few luxury brands I feel is worth it (on sale of course).  Scent wise I find Sulwhasoo pretty mild, I tried a couple minis from Amore Pacific and couldn&#39;t use it due to the fragrance.",
            "Love your video Alice <br>This just a recommendation I know that you made a video about ( skin1004 ) you think you can re update about skin 1004 ?",
            "I love sulwhasoo! Yes style is place to buy and save $$$$ ❤",
            "I personally think the Sulwhasoo cleansing oil is my favorite one so far because it consistently removes all the blackheads and whiteheads from my nose every time I use it. I haven’t found another cleansing oil like that. Plus it smells sooo good! It’s also 30% off ($28) right now for Amazon prime day",
            "There are some Sulwhasoo deals on Prime Day (7/16-7/17/24) too!",
            "I agree that minis are sufficient for masks. They last a long time and you don&#39;t need much for every use. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried the overnight sleeping mask and it made my skin so soft in the morning! Honestly did not expect it to work that well. The clarifying mask is also very satisfying because it truly can peel in one piece. My skin feels smoother afterwards. <br><br>I&#39;ve used the concentrated ginseng balancer and emulsion (mini sizes), but felt they were just okay. The concentrated ginseng serum made me break out a little, which is not usual for me! <br><br>Have you used Whoo? I&#39;m a massive fan of the Gonjinhyang (orange) line, I swear my skin looks amazing and I won&#39;t break out with it. Their minis are cheaper than Sulwhasoo. <br><br>I also recommend trying Cle de Peau softening lotion - it really makes the skin softer. There&#39;s a faint but pleasant fragrance. I did not expect to like it!",
            "I agree with your take on minis! I was disappointed when I picked up minis of the essential balancing water and emulsion - it was so hard to get the emulsion out of the small bottle 😅",
            "Ahh yes 2019 the era of fragrance phobia 😂 Hyram literally brainwashed a whole generation",
            "I keep thinking it’s expensive until I realise that I can buy it on sale for the same as I can buy Neutrogena, L’Oreal and Olay here in Australia.",
            "but why are they full of fragrance :(",
            "i love minis but they are so rare and i would love it if i could buy samples!",
            "As much as I love their fragrances and ingredients, a lot of the Sulwhasoo leave on products sensitize my skin. I do get minis every once in a while to use on my body or just to experience the luxurious textures! I’ve gotten their foaming cleanser as well in the full size and although it’s nothing groundbreaking, the scent is what gets me! Also the price on that product is actually reasonable on some of the Korean retailers. I loved to use the ginseng line on my hands and feet when it’s cold outside to boost up circulation and I haven’t had any issues there. I wish the peeling mask was more of a gel like the im from mugwort mask, but oh well! It’s a pain to remove if you don’t do a thick layer😂 thanks as always for your in depth review!",
            "Sulwhasoo is on sale for prime day! I still can&#39;t afford it but I hope others can lol",
            "I never used this brand as I never buy luxury skincare, I use my luxury item budget for makeup as I don&#39;t like cheap or drugstore makeup, but when it comes to skincare I prefer the affordable variety. The products do sound interesting, the mini size might me something I will try",
            "800?? is it made from garden of eden plant extracts?",
            "I have the opposite experience with Overnight mask. For some reason my skin felt so dry every morning after using this. But, I&#39;m planning to get other minis to try :)",
            "I love this brand!!",
            "That tin is my sewing kit!!! 😂😂😂<br>Great video!  Many blessings!!!💖💖💖",
            "The way I was kind of hoping you’d give some criticisms because I’ve been fighting for my life to not allow myself to buy full sizes of the ginseng line 😩😩😩<br><br>But I will say that I never believed in the concept of luxury moisturizer because how good can a moisturizer be…until I bought a mini renewal cream. I couldn’t articulate how it was so good, but it really was - totally worth the price if you can swing it.",
            "I do like luxury Korean skincare. The serums are spectacular ❤",
            "The brand review that I&#39;m most excited about. I have been watching your videos for a while and I love every single one I&#39;ve watched. I&#39;m definitely a big fan of Sulwhasoo and my dry sensitive acne prone skin seems to love Sulwhasoo products so much.

I have bought the mini size  of the first care activating serum and the overnight mask from Sulwhasoo all too frequently... 😂<br><br>I have bought the balancing essence but I think I can skip the additional cost for this product. <br><br>I will continue to buy the cleansing foam since I like its gentle formula in a foam cleanser... <br><br>The moisturizer is too costly and I prefer to stay with the Chogongjin instead... 🎉",

            "Ok if Lamer was bought... Dior is still French and was never American. Its confusing because you&#39;re talking about trying Korean skincare vs American while using basically French and German brands.",
            "I’ve been using luxury products for about 18 months now. I’ve gone through routines from, La Mer, Sulwhasoo, SK-II, Shiseido, Tatcha, and The History of Whoo. And depending on one’s skin issues, it does take more than a month to see drastic positive change. And as mentioned, it’s best to stay loyal to a brand than mixing and matching too much. My tip is to have one brand as a core, and maybe have 1-2 products that isn’t from the brand, like a face wash and an active. One thing to note is that most luxury skincare is aimed towards more mature skin, or people in their 30s. Starting early doesn’t hurt, just be mindful that one won’t see results right away and that textures will usually be on the heavier side even when they’re supposedly for oily skin.<br><br>I honestly think luxury beauty is worth it. It truly works on increasing resilience in the skin which lessens breakouts and slows down aging without the use of strong exfoliants or retinoids. But it takes time to see this effect. Like more than 6 months of consistent use. My skin has only had a major breakout during this time, which was due to traveling and less than good diet. <br><br>My honest thoughts is that any luxury brand will do! You just have to find one that speaks with your skin and find the products for your skin type. Just because one cream feels heavy doesn’t mean the whole brand is a waste. Pick one brand and stick to it. My personal favorite is Shiseido, their formulas and textures are top notch. Love Sulwhasoo, but it’s not as readily available for me. I hate to say it, but La Mer, the cream, there’s something magic about it. I use it more as a night treatment once a week during winter and can do with one of the smaller jars. I like the simplicity of a SK-II skincare routine, but their cream and serum is very heavily fragranced, so I only endorse the Pitera essence and their face wash. Honestly, more people should talk about their face wash.",
            "You have to try Savef Skin Essential Face Serum- luxury serum.witout fragrance, no nonsense. Please try something new! It&#39;s $155 and it is amazing. Evens my skin hydrates, and I have no hormonal break outs??? Real Skin Retinue is the brand only one product! 😊",
            "La mer👎👎👎👎",
            "I’m sorry you missed this, but most of the products you used were not American. Augustinus Bader is German, La Mer is also German, Sulwhasoo is Korean, SK-II is Japanese, and Dior is French. The only products you used that were American were from Shani Darden, which you said you liked. Almost every single luxury brand that’s popular in America is from other countries like France or Italy. <br><br>That being said, I’ve tried a lot of these products and I totally agree with you, the only ones that are really worth it are the Sulwhasoo and Shani Darden. Dior’s skincare is kind of a flop and the rest are just so expensive and not worth it tbh.",
            "I CAN tell you one think , I only use beurre de karite pure , I have no wrinkles and my face is like a baby...",

            "Loved it!",
            "you are soooo pretty!!!",
            "Augustinus Bader cream stinks so bad. I can only use it the mornings before applying spf and make up. It serves as a good moisturizing primer.",
            "Thank you so much for mentioning that korean skincare will market the actual ingredients to the buyers where as American luxury products do not. I started using korean skincare back in 2016 and I noticed a big positive change in my skin. I think it&#39;s because korean skincare makes it known to the buyer what the ingredients are and what they are for. This helped me learn what ingredients works for my skin and which ingredients do not. Korean skincare really helped me learn about skincare ingredients which I now carry over to American skincare products when purchasing.",
            "love this video! the only brand that i dislike is La Mer. their moisturiser gives me bad pimple! like the huge painful ones :( the best thing about the moisturiser is, it is a good make up based as it makes my makeup looks so flawless. sadly the fragrance is so strong hence why i have bad breakouts.",
            "Augustinus Bader is German not American but boy that cream is magic. I bought it on Black Friday to test and it changed my skin like crazy in a few days and it was already in a good place. I went and bought the whole range soon after. I have no regrets. I never spent so much money on skincare. I will never use anything else. It’s also scent free which I love!",

            "Alice, Suwhasoo actiavting serum on Stylevana, the set of 2X 15 ml = 30 ml costs around 18 Euros. So I am again confused :D That is not expensive at all. But then I noticed that if you buy 90 ml size, it is so much more expensive per 1 ml, how come??  Are mini&#39;s maybe fake? uchhh  please end my confusion regardin this brand:D i just want to try it but before i do, i have to understand:D",
            "I have been using Missha’s Chocongjin Youngan Toner for 2 weeks now which i feel is similar to Sulwhasoo First Essence . It contains alcohol too and it does seem to enhance the absorption of other skincare. I use it together with Tretinoin 0.05% followed by History of Whoo ginseng eye and face cream and getting great results .<br>Agree with you it would be too reactive to pair with AHA which thanks to your video I will not attempt to try .",
            "Great video great advice I stay away from alcohol based products",
            "I just saw this video and learnt some stuff I was trying to find answers for .I love your way of reviewing stuff.please update if u have continued to use any of this stuff and the results following use💐",
            "Two weeks is not a credible review. Skin molecularly changes within 3 to 6 mo",
            "Hello<br>Can i use vit c or tretinoin after the first  care activating serum? Thank you",
            "i like history of whoo and sulwahasso.  I feel like i am at spa having a facial with sulwahassoo time treasure  line every night before i go to bed.",
            "I really love their product, actually I just did the Sulwhasoo first care review on my Youtube,  yours are so much detail, I need to learn about it :) Thanks for sharing those info!",
            "The traditional Korean/Chinese/Japanese medicinal principle actually recommends steeping the herbs and proprietary medicine inside wine, so as to help preserve and enhance the delivery system. For ingestion, because it is a very low amount ingested, the effects are actually better because there is very little alcohol in the body and plus, the body organs react to alcohol differently from the skin, which does not have the same ability to break down alcohol unlike the liver or kidney. Recently, I read that even a little alcohol is used to ferment herbs and the extract derived from this fermentation process is way more potent than just steeping the herbs alone. The bacterial action over time probably neutralises the alcohol too.",
            "The Balancing line in Sulwhasoo is really not moisturizing enough for winter, especially in South Korea and Canada as I discovered. The Timetreasure line is actually more moisturizing, but it is just so pricey!",
            "This is one of my favorite skincare brands, I am a confirmed K Beauty-holic 🤣 my favorite Sulwhasoo products are the gentle cleansing foam, First Care serum, Overnight Vitalizing Mask (I use it as an everyday moisturizer in the winter!) and if you want a real treat, the Timetreasure Sleeping Mask. The next morning, you wake up a new woman 😆 I buy that with Afterpay, so I&#39;m not breaking the bank.<br>Another Korean brand I LOVE, and starting to like just as much at a smaller pricetag is Primera!! If you haven&#39;t seen a review on them yet, They are great!!<br>I love this review!! Great job",
            "Love this brand. I used to have acne for years and used to use ton of make up to cover it which made my skin just worse. Ever since I started using these products my skin cleared up, my wrinkles are fading away and my face glows. I don’t use make up anymore other than mascara. This is not cheap but worth every penny.",
            "Hello Alice, I received a kit of Sulhwasoo from my sister in law as gift. She said to use it since it&#39;s a high end beauty product from Korea. You&#39;re right, i had a hard time finding info in Google on how to use it step by step. I&#39;m glad i came across your vlog. I&#39;m finally starting to use their basic products...  I just wanna say it has become my favorite! It&#39;s making my skin look and feel better even if I&#39;m 50. Btw, I&#39;m asian, so probably the result varies from skin type to skin type. Anway, thank u for showing me how.",
            "I had the same kind of issue.. I kept looking through that same reddit thread you mentioned, plus Fiddy and Snow White &amp; the Asian Pear for guidance.. I now make sure to use my chemical exfoliants before the first care activating serum and waiting a bit, just focusing on my cheeks, etc. I used P50 1970 this morning, then the Missha Chogongjin toner and then the first care activating serum. I&#39;m still playing around with how to add in vitamin C alongside my favorite Sulwhasoo products.. The timetreasure eye serum is great, they sell packets on Ebay that are very affordable and you get multiple use out of them. I&#39;d love your thoughts on the Radiant Energy mask. I have it and I enjoy it but for some reason I can&#39;t find a ton about it",
            "Is this good for teenagers with oily skin ?? Currently I&#39;m suffering from comedones",
            "You didn&#39;t do your research well. It&#39;s not just ginseng. It&#39;s a rare red ginseng found in Korea. Raiza Contawi made a more in-depth review.",
            "I think it is important to be open minded with what we think as set knowledge we think of as correct. Many different ways of doing things turn other knowledge on its head. To me this shows that although alcohol is a major trigger of peoples skin - it is by no means the only ingredient that is damaging  to the skin. How many other ingredients we use in western skin care that have no visible reactions yet we blindly accept and continue to use of when there is not such obvious reactions such as alcohol. It seems in this instance the alcohol is counteracted by the ingredients to work really well and render it harmless. The use and application of science means ingredients are not necessarily always bad - they just haven&#39;t been used in a way that makes them useful and not harmful.",
            "Sulwhasoo gets my skin plump and supple. For some reasons absorption of other products is easier too. I still think we need to mix up active ingredients with herbal range for it to work",
            "Can you use the Pharmacy Honeymoon Glow product on days you don’t use the Sulwhasoo activating serum?",
            "according to the official page in Asian, the balancing serum should be used before toner.",
            "I’m Asian and I’m using it according to the manufacturer. Like you said it might be pricey for some but it’s because research has gone into it. For me, It’s worth every penny and working pretty well for me. I think consistency is key. This is just my opinion.",
            "They do not use the same drying alcohol as western skin care",
            "I tried the overnight mask<br>Its holy grail in myskin for about 3 weeks<br>And then i don’t feel the same effects after that<br>I stop using this for about 2 or 3 months <br>I begin using it again after myskin feel not good (too dry and a bit showing pigmentations)<br>Its give a holy effects again<br>I think the overnight vitalizing mask like repairing your skin<br>If your skin okay, its not really giving effects from outside..",
            "I&#39;m sorry, but the way you pronounce sulwhasoo just really cringed me like omg.",
            "Hey, loved your review on these products! Recently I got a box containing the first care activating serum, the essential balancing water ex, the essential balancing emulsion ex and the concentrated ginseng renewing cream ex as a gift. Your review helped alot as this brand is very new to me. But I have a question about whether I can use a moisturiser from a different brand which I normally use in day time. Would it have any reaction with these sulwhasoo products?",
            "Hi. I really like your review. I&#39;m trying out the first care activating serum from sulwhasoo and very surprise when I found out it has alcohol! (from your video...yea...I didn&#39;t read the ingredients too... haha). Alcohol has been a taboo in my skin care routine, but your video change my mind! I have no problem using the serum so far. It&#39;s only been a week, but I can see the difference on my skin. I&#39;m combining sulwhasoo first care activating serum with innisfree whitening pore serum. I&#39;d suggest you to review innisfree product too! Haha. It is from the same big korean company with sulwhasoo (Amore Pacific), but cheaper (to say it in a bold way). It&#39;s as cheap as drugstore product, so I would recommend you trying it out too as a comparison with this &#39;high end&#39; sulwhasoo product. :&quot;) <br>I love your review and am so gonna subscribe. Thanks so much! I am soooo going to try out the clarifying mask. :D",
            "After watching this video, I bought a 90ml of first care activating serum. I receive two sample size of essential balancing water and emulsion. I never saw a serum like this before. It is lightweight and sink into your skin really really fast but very very hydrating.",
            "Sulwhasoo renewing cream feels sooooo lovely on my face.. but it  is over ) £100 🥺.  I’m wondering if I can get same effect with cheaper products.",
            "I like the ginseng eye cream. Price is at par with my lamer eye cream. I enjoyed the sample but do I change lamer for sulwhasoo? When it come to my daily eye treatment routine?",
            "I would love for you to try Sulwhasoo&#39;s Herblinic Intensive Infusion Ampoules. If I could only have one product from the company, I think it would be that one. Maybe it&#39;s all in my head!",
            "So you wouldn&#39;t want to use retinol after the First Activating Serum product either.  Seems like this brand is a bit hit and miss if you combine with standard Western, non-herbal, products. Thanks. Good to know.",
            "Thank you for this review dear, was super helpfull, eye ave been curious about this brand,i learn a lot with this review about products that contains Alcohol, as i purchased not long a go the ysl youth creator range ,wich most of the products contain alcohol ,and just like you said i heard that is drying,and i have combo dry/dehydrated  skin<br>But as caused me no inrritation at all 😊once again thank you for all your information.<br>Lots of love<br>(Oh yes i wont use no aha or retinol with it just as you sugested,play safe)",

            "I&#39;ve been using this line for over 9 years. I broke out with chicken pox as a 20 year old and only their snow wise along with the history of whoo whitening line removed all the scaring",
            "Very informative video! Do you think we can use the sulwhasoo balance water and then follow with a hyaluronic acid serum and vit c serum?",
            "Very nice beautiful i love watching your videos and i have dry skin so would love also try this out",
            "Also at Ulta at right now I believe it&#39;s until November 17th that that Platinum gets 5 x the points and Diamond gets 10 times the points I just wanted to share with you that info so you could check it out and maybe make a video on it I hope you&#39;re having a good weekend and if you knew could we use both bonuses together the Mario badescu 150 points and the Platinum five times the points would that be something that we could do or you&#39;re not sure just wanted to see if you knew any info about stacking bonus points",

            "I&#39;m a big K-beauty fan, but this is one brand I&#39;ve never tried. Very interesting video! I also find your discussion on alcohol interesting. You can say whatever you want about it; I&#39;m not horrified by it. :) I have good skin, normal right down the line (slightly oily T-zone, but that&#39;s about it.) I hate to tell you the toners I used to use before toners were a thing. They were mostly alcohol! They were great for removing dirt in the pores, and I didn&#39;t mind a slightly dry skin, because moisturizer took care of it. I was also the chick who was using mud masks eons ago, way before it became a fad. My skin is remarkably good for all that &#39;abuse.&#39; (You know what I think really worked for me not having any appreciable wrinkles? I&#39;ve been a fanatic about wearing sunglasses since I was a teenager. Preferably BIG sunglasses. Not a wrinkle anywhere near my eyes. Who knew?)",
            "No Ferrari? Whaaa?!?!",
            "Funnily enough (ironic :/ ) i have the same skin you have, but muuuuuuch older . Dehydrated but really prone to break outs and I am finally trying to use BHAs to clear blackheads and congestion but i have the feeling i keep on slightly and slightly and slightly purging non freaking stop. Do you use BHAs regularly? Did you maybe even already film a video about Salicylic acid alone? Thank you :) xoxo",
            "This reminds me of one makeup influencer, who I don&#39;t remember anymore, said, &quot;Take me back to the simpler days&quot; 😁 The days when our grannies never had so much stuff for beauty care. Yet, here I am watching and curious about these beauty products 😎 Love these types of videos, just for additionak information sake coz, man, they&#39;re so pricey 🙄",

            "Why’s your skin gotta look so great during some of the expensive trials? Haha. <br><br>I don’t always watch your more makeup-focused videos, but I LOVE these. ❤️",
            "I do have aging dry skin, so I have a difficult time finding skincare that I like. Your videos are the most informative skincare on YouTube, in my opinion. I appreciate all the work &amp; research you put into your videos!",
            "Awww. I would also want a Ferrari... a red one ;-P",
            "Your skincare reviews are about the only ones I listen to and trust. For that reason I&#39;m so glad I found your channel and will always be consistent in my support for you. I absolutely love your personality and I could honestly listen to you fill my brain with useful information all day.

            "Thank you for this great video you save my money!! New subscriber!!! More people like you we need it in this plataform!! You’re so honest!! ❤❤❤❤",
            "It’s so interesting that we’re judging a product by its price first then ingredient second. I have been using these products for 10+ years and my dermatologist can attest.",
            "I would say the brand is at par with other high end make up lines, for example, Lancôme (my favourite) is almost double the price. Tatcha (another favourite) cost more. Yes it’s expensive but I’d say again, it’s at par with other high end skin lines",
            "Some molecules dissolve better in water, some in alcohol.  I&#39;m betting that is why those ingredients are present.",
            "Sorry to interrupt . I am using sulwhasoo and it gives smooth , complexion and healthy skin effect . I am using concentrated ginseng and its the best btw",
            "This lady doesn’t understand ingredients or formulations. This is a fantastic brand and regarded as one of the best in K Beauty, it is the trend setter and many of the street beauty brands you are recommending make cheap knock-off skincare of Sulwhasoo",
            "Yes! Finally real genuine review. And finally someone talks the ingredients! Thank you thank you! All the other videos I watch are so into the brand that no one admits what’s in it. Yes I agree no alcohol in my skin!",
            "I have been using Sulwhasoo for 2 years and so far I don&#39;t have any issue to it.  I always buy big containers because small containers are rip off.  <br>This is how I use my Sulwhasoo:<br>1. Gensing Cleansing Oil<br>2.  Gensing Cleansing Foam<br>3.  Balancing Water<br>4.  First Care Activating Serum <br>5.  Concentrated Gensing Renewing <br>      Cream<br>Twice a week I have to use the Clarifying Mask and 3x  a week I have to use the Concentrated Gensing Rescue Ampoule. I use this product 2x a day, morning and night. I also have cream for night and for eyes as well. And I also use sulwhasoo sunscreen and foundation as well. <br>I&#39;ve tried a of beauty products but unfortunately it didnt like me at all. The last set i had was oil of Olay, the color purple. I had to toss it  because  it burned my face. So that that day i decided to use Sulwhasoo.  This is the only beauty products that don&#39;t harsh on  my skin as Asian. <br>Bottom line. If you’re looking to boost the efficacy of your favorite serums and moisturizers, this is a win.",

They may not have samples of everything in the line but usually have the best sellers in sample size. Samples may or may not be free but worth it to try first before spending a lot of $$$. :)",

Buy a set of miniatures....<br>The aroma of some Korean products is specific, but Sulwhasoo is a brand that focuses on tradition, so this is natural.<br>It&#39;s strange to hear that you call glass packaging poor quality... Luxury brands (Dior, for example) use glass for their products. This is a luxury....",

I belive that you upload your video at the covid-19 pandemic time, most of store are not accept he return because of the hygiene &amp; the owner have the right to protect others.  If you bought sulwhasoo product at department store &amp; the bottle had been used, I don&#39;t think you can return it or refund either.  Imagine you are a store owner and the situation is happen to you,  how are you going to solve this problem? I&#39;m a bit curious and I&#39;m very  sure you&#39;re  doing the same thing as them. <br>Regarding your product review, I think your review is a bit personal. I  guess that you&#39;re still upsetting that you can&#39;t get the money refund on the product and just try to make money out of youtube.  The products  may not suitable with your skin but it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not suitable for other peoples skin.  <br>By the way,  you may not know thay the glass bottles/jars are better protecting the ingredients of natural skincare product &amp; increases the shelf life. You may also not know that  there are  many  luxury skincare brand incl. Aesop, Dior and Lamer,  most of their products are in glass bottles &amp; containers. It&#39;s  a luxury!!",

There are much better quality Korean products out there for much less in price. Other than the ginseng there isn’t really anything that stands out. Thanks for your review. It helped me validate even more why I will not be trying these products",

            "I bought this foundation as a replacement for my beloved discontinued Charlotte Tilbury Light Wonder foundation and I adore it! I really think it’s as light and as luminous as Light Wonder. For anyone interested, I was a shade 6 in LW and wear 330 in Shiseido revitalessence.",

            "Do you prefer this over the Hourglass skin tint?",
            "I&#39;m exactly the same with the gray tone!!!  There are those of us who search everywhere for foundations with this tone (mostly Asian brands).  Could you please let Shiseido know we NEED a light version of this shade!!  It goes from 150 to 310 (what they call rosy but it&#39;s really a gray), it jumps from Fair 150 to Medium 310.  Skipping the major category of Light??  I have to purchase both shades to mix to get the right shade, that&#39;s not fair.  Everything in between is more yellow.  Thanks! 🤍",
            "Nice review!!! Thank you for sharing Michelle!!!!",
            "This foundation looks lovely on you! How would you say it compares to their Future Solution LX foundation?",
            "Is it tacky or does it dry down?",
            "I’m Asian and had a colour analysis done on me recently. The lady told me a lot of Asians wrongly think they’re warm toned due to the top layer of our skin being yellow-ish but that she believes that a lot is actually cool tones though still with a yellow-warm top layer making the concoction not behave according to the regular foundation rules (pink/yellow). Not sure if it applies here but wanted to let you know 😊",
            "♥",
            "I have the exact same thing with my skin undertone! Grey tones seem to work best. I am a bit darker though and normally wear 260 in the radiant lifting foundation. Do you have any recommandations for foundations that have grey undertones in their ranges?",
            "Hi Michelle, your skin looks gorgeous. Nice w foundation too.",
            "Just subscribed to your newsletter and omg! You just look truly stunning in those pics. What an understated, elegant site. I was truly excited for you to see what a great job you did putting this newsletter together, very classy!!",
            "Your skin looks beautiful!! I&#39;ve always wanted to try this brand. When I run out of my Dior, I might just try this! Idk why, little bit random, but I always like to watch you put on makeup. You apply product like Lisa Eldridge and of course you know she&#39;s a real MUA. 😁",
            "I can&#39;t remember if I responded to this video. The foundation looks great on you and initially sounded like a go for me. Unfortunately, it has lavender oil which doesn&#39;t agree with my skin type. I guess I will continue my search.",
            "Gorgeous foundation",
            "This foundation looks fantastic! Have to try it although Shiseido has not been among my favourite brands until now - no bad experiences, just haven&#39;t tried a lot.",
            "Love sour glasses - which brand are they?",
            "After you put that first swipe on, you could see in seconds that it was a great match for you. Very pretty. <br>My favorite foundation in the early 90s was by Shiseido. I switched to Nars because they discontinued my shade and changed the formula.<br>I am 57 and would like to try it. Lately I’ve been liking skin tints, like the Hourglass Veil Hydrating Skin Tint.  I don’t like how foundations sometimes settle in the slight wrinkles in my forehead. 😕<br>I would like to try Shiseido again, but unfortunately, Sephora doesn’t carry the cosmetics in store, so I can’t get a sample first and also website is not finding a shade match for me. I think the “Shade Match” hasn’t been programmed with the new product yet. Hopefully Sephora will update their website. <br>Thanks for your review!  🥰",

            "Love your glasses! I got one in PR as well and I thought I had done a video… 😳 whoops",

            "Do more Sheisado!  Truly wonderful brand!  Tried and true for 50 plus years💝",
            "I have Shiseido synchro skin self-refreshing and radiance lift foundation, both are great especially after few hours, the foundation did not go darker and still nice. Have to try this one, look forward to it!!",
            "Woot woot !<br>I was waiting for someone to review this foundation and it has to be you!<br>So far, all the reviews that you did,  my wallet suffered 😅<br>Thank you for the review and I really like the makeup on you especially the lipstick (thinking of going to get it 😅)",
            "This foundation looks very nice on you.  Color matching is challenging for me; and the descriptions the manufacturers use aren&#39;t always accurate.  I like some of Shiseido&#39;s products, I will say that this foundation looks like a pretty nice formula (especially for dry skin)! <br>I missed your birthday, Happy belated, I hope you had a great day and a wonderful year ahead!🎈🎊🎂💕  Take care, Ginny 😘😘😘",
            "I love the cool toned foundation on you. So chic",
            "Thank you so much for reviewing the new Shiseido foundation. Looks encouraging with this slight glow. Thank you for showing it also in the day lights, it is so crusial while deciding on the best possible colour. And please do share all the grey ones with me as well :) Once again thank, it is always great to see your new videos. Warm regards from Poland.",
            "Yup that is the right sale. I hope it works..I like their products and it looks thin and moisturize….I might give it a try….some luminosity? I think it’s looking pretty good.",
            "I picked this foundation up a couple weeks ago and it is my favorite foundation I bought two bottles. Every time I find my foundation it ends up being discontinued",
            "💜💜💖",
            "This new Shiseido foundation has definitely piqued my interest, especially after seeing it on you 🤩. But what to do…I have so much makeup already 😱. Thanks for showing it to us, Michele! Have a nice wknd. 😊❤",
            "Maybe using a primer would help?",
            "Hi Michele, really love your glasses! Can you tell me who’s the maker? Thank you!"

            "I thoroughly enjoyed this video, thank you!!! <br><br>I’m Asian, but not from Japan, and I remember my GREAT grandmother sitting me down at the kitchen table with a mirror in front of me when I was as young as 6 or 7 years old all the way up until she died when I was 17. She lived in the US, but couldn’t speak English, and while she was proud of my educational goals, she REALLY, REALLY thought it was important that I focus on my skin, my nails, my hair, and my weight lol. I know she really wanted me to practice my techniques over and over again, as she thought that would guarantee me a man in life. 🤣 <br><br>We would do “lessons” in front of that mirror for hours a week  and I learned how to contour before contouring was even a thing. I knew how to pluck and shape the most perfect eyebrows. I knew how to use eyeshadow to make it appear like I actually had eyelids. <br><br>I have so many hours and so much experience, I could easily  be a hair stylist and a makeup artist. <br><br>My great grandma SWORE by Shiseido products, and they are amazing, and I still use a lot of them today. <br><br>They are very expensive compared to your drug store brands, so I don’t use them for every part of my face routine. <br><br>There is one product I buy religiously, and I honestly don’t know if it’s better than cheaper products, but I know it smells just like my great grandma used to so I can’t stop purchasing it! It’s $140 for the cream, which is a bit much, but it’s worth it for the smell and memories!!!",

Since then, it has become a long-established Japanese cosmetics store that operates in over 180 countries and regions around the world. Representative cosmetics brands include Shiseido, Maquillage, and IPSA. The other three are Kao, Kose, and Pola.",
