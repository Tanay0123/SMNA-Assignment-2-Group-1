I think the issue is for women who have darker or mid toned complexions. There was once a time when finding shades for women of color was nearly impossible. The options were very few. I remember going to the cosmetic counter for foundation. The women only had a few shades dark, darker and darkest. None worked for me, this is when I stopped going to the counters for foundation but things have really improved since then.",12300000,3586763920,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

Pure facts, unfortunately businesses still have some residual traces of what could be considered racism. From a business perspective it does make sense why there are hundreds of makeup styles (or whatever you call them) on the lighter side of the spectrum but not on the darker, but in a few years the big businesses of the world will have no choice but to acknowledge the growing number and growing customer base of darker skinned people. It is unfair that more specific shades of style thingy are towards lighter skinned people but not darker skinned people, this needs to change and I believe it will change as the number of darker skinned people grows through the years and as racial inequality changes and shrinks as we know it.",12300000,3586763920,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

Try this - if you own a lipstick swatch it on the inside of your palm in the area where your skin is the most light in shade. Swatch the same shade of lipstick on the upperside of your palm. Since this area is exposed to sun it will be tanner than the inside of your palm. You will see the color difference in both the swatches. I swear to god when I did it on my hand I was blown away.

And canada is simply a predominantly white country. Just like we view africa being a continent with more black people. And the thing is white countries arent making any profit from making products for black people simply because theres not that many of them there. Same goes for brands. For example tirtir (which you reviewed recently) is a korean brand. Korea is also a country that naturally does not have many black people that are korean through and through. Because of geographical location and just science. As i said why would companies such as this have to make black products when they are gaining no money from it. Im sure in places such as africa it would be the exact same. A wide range of black shades with no white shades. And thats because most (not all) of africa is black. And yet nobody is talking about it? White people are not as &quot;important&quot; because of what society has put on us. Because of the prejudice you faced? Idk but its not a reason to only praise black people and ignore everyone else. Not having enough pale shades is also not inclusive. As you love to say. Idk maybe im in the wrong.

I’m sure there’s very fair skinned people out there too that can’t find right shade in a lot of brands but I don’t see them making videos like this about not being inclusive. There are several brands which do have darker shades so just shop there. This video super cringe and obviously posted just to get more views. There’s plenty of brands that don’t have brow products that are red toned for redheads out there, actually most brands don’t include any red shade at all. I haven’t seen one video of a redhead blaming all the companies out there for not having shade specifically for them. It may not make financial sense for a company to have so many shades especially if certain shades only a very small percentage of people will buy those shades. It costs companies a lot of money to carry so many shades in stock and if not many are being bought in certain shades, then that is all money lost to the company and so they do what makes the most financial sense for them. They have to do what is most business savvy for their company and if they don’t want to carry 50 plus shades that’s their right",441000,217534108,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I went to the basics and tried Elizabeth Arden, but guess what? That stuff was straight up green! I never had a “green” problem, lol…….. so I stick to my Bobbi brown she is the only one who has ever gotten my undertone and color right apart from Marc Jacob’s but Yano they went out of business… bare minerals is yellow despite them seemingly catering to lighter complexions. <br><br>I’ll try urban decay thanks for this<br><br>And edit: yes I know that I could just paint my entire face and neck and go a few shades darker if I wanted too, but this really only works in the winter time for me.

I don’t like either. I get very oily and sweaty easily and the only way you can wear the foundation is if you slather on some kind of moisturizer beforehand otherwise it’ll just crack all over. It’s a very very dry formula and it dries immediately after touching the skin which makes it hard to blend. Youd think this would be a good thing for oily skin but nope! And good luck finding a cheap setting spray that will make it last. The foundation will last maybe 3 hours max. I’ve tried 4 different setting sprays with this foundation and it all makes it horrible. The best foundation for my combo oily skin is Macc. But I have already bought the fenty and can’t afford to buy a new bottle so I’m stuck with it.

I was totally gobsmacked!  The range of color and undertone wasn&#39;t anything I have ever seen before.  It was so fulfilling to be able to match foundation to everyone!  She even had a shade for me! Being light medium with pink undertones, it is extremely hard to get a match.  The sales were through the roof, and we had many many happy customers. She definitely set the bar for other brands.  I have seen many launches of other brands since, and they still lack in this day and age, shade range.  Rare Beauty has come very close. Fenty Beauty has consistently launched excellent products. The lip gloss is divine.  You will have to pry the Ease Drop Skintint and Powder foundation out of my cold dead hands!

The way she does her think is impressive. And I think Fenty is going to still be very successful moving forward. First good move that comes to my mind to support my feelings is the fact that Rihanna didn&#39;t put her known name in the brand. She put her last name, which makes a little bit difficult for people in general to connect everything to her. This is good, because, although there is an association that benefits the brand, there is also disconnection that can allow Rihanna to live her life without people getting sick of hearing her name all the time. <br><br>Second, Rihanna has a very low-key lifestyle. She doesn&#39;t reveal that much about her personal life to the public nowadays. We don&#39;t even know her son&#39;s name hahaha. In that sense, she kinda stays out of trouble and her image stays as cool as possible.

This perception is what&#39;s used as a weapon by people to defend actual issues of cultural appropriation.<br><br>A HUGE, VITAL concept to acknowledge with Japanese cultural-related things I think is merely the MISREPRESENTATION/MISINFORMATION aspect of it. As in, wearing a cheongsam [from China] in a &#39;geisha&#39; [from Japan] look as Katy Perry did from the paper you mentioned was MISINFORMATION and MISREPRESENTATION.<br><br>Mixing and matching our cultures like that continuously spreads the false narrative that us asians are all the same, and once again I think people get too caught up in the &#39;is this white person wearing a kimono ok&#39; rather than looking into the issue specifically of Mixing and Matching our cultures. <br><br>Furthermore , almost all &#39;kimonos&#39; in the context of Western usage are some weird orientalist, shiny and flimsy cloth [japanese kimonos are not shiny lol] that is very thin, showing a lot of skin,<br><br>no layering [kimonos, outside of yukatas which are for the summer, are very heavily layered to a point that it is warmer to wear a kimono outside in the Japanese winter than Western clothing and a jacket]<br><br>very curvy [the curvy silhouette historically speaking was a huge Western trend that went in and out historically speaking with corsets and so on but with Japan we emphasize more of an up and down straight silhouette where the kimono deliberately hides your waist so you look more like a rectangle, using a very very THICK and expensive piece called an obi], <br><br>and throws in Chinese motifs/prints [japanese and chinese prints are very different visually because once again different cultures] and some dragon thing and maybe some korean influence as well and once again plays this mixing and matching game with our cultural clothing and the colors are also super off [we opt for more demure colors rather than super bright ones]. No tabi is worn despite the kimono being presented as a non-yukata.<br><br>Another depiction of kimonos, which is almost even more bastardized in a way, is that it&#39;s used as a synonym for &#39;robe&#39;. Often times I see bridesmaids robes labeled &#39;kimonos&#39;- once again, sleek, shiny, showing a lot of skin, 0 layers, non-japanese patterning [that is probably associated with orientalist associations]. And finally there was the Kim Kardashian pre-Skims kimono scandal, which, had she gone forth with the original name, I fear how even more watered down our cultural clothing would&#39;ve become.<br><br>Another issue is once again these brands that are depicting inaccurate depictions of kimonos might use east asian models- they may not be japanese but to the consumer, &quot;who cares?&quot; fits their mental orientalist assumptions- and I think that is another huge issue with spreading the misconceptions because the usage of an east asian model allows a false credibility to the depicted clothing because consumers who don&#39;t know better would think &#39;Ah, east asian clothing worn by east asian, that means this kimono is legit&#39;.<br><br>I actually saw a tiktok that was made with good intentions and hence was trending that showed &#39;bad&#39; asian cultural clothing [usually halloween costumes] vs the &#39;real&#39; asian cultural clothing, except for the kimono because the creator who didnt realize (so no fault to her), she ended up using a picture of a nonauthentic &#39;kimono&#39; from a Chinese website. <br>Once again, east asian countries also have nonauthentic depictions of eachother&#39;s cultural clothing, like in Japan we also depict Chinese cultural clothing stereotypically which can be often seen in manga as a trope, [Chun Li is an example]. But anyway, because the creator saw that it looked legit enough as it came from a mainland Asian website, she believed it was authentic. But unforutnately this unintentionally continued the spread of misinformation in terms of our kimono as it was presented as the &#39;real&#39; version haha. This can be harmful as well.<br><br>The makeup industry having controversy over orientalist stuff isn&#39;t new, as can be seen with the Limecrime China Doll [which once again mixed our cultures up and was full of misinformation] incident. With the Fenty beauty thing, to be honest, I have seen worse so I wouldnt personally feel super upset about it, but the way it was used as a mere adjective can be of course a contribution to the watering down of our culture [like kimono/skims incident], so the outrage was understandable.<br><br>Anyway instead of looking up &#39;kimono&#39; in English , due to the rampant misinformation and Halloween brands tryna sell &#39;sexy dragon geisha lady kpop konnichiwa&#39; clothes pushing the wrong results to the top, I always tell peers to look up in Google Images:<br>着物は (translates to kimono, but with a hiragana at the end so google knows your search request is japanese)<br>振袖は (translates to furisode, but with a hiragana at the end so google knows your search request is japanese)<br>着物の種類 (looks up types of kimono, which ranges from yukata, furisode, oofurisode, kimono [its a subcategory within its own category], and houmongi [hakama is also a piece added onto the kimono/furisode that creates the hakama look for graduation or worn by those working at a shinto temple])<br><br>for &#39;geisha&#39;<br>芸者とは (what is a geisha)<br>芸者と舞妓の違い (difference between geisha and maiko)<br>芸者と舞妓と花魁の違い (difference between geisha, maiko, and oiran [oiran is often sexualized and fetishized so where a lot of orientalist stuff comes from imo esp where people dont know the difference betwen a geisha and oiran lol])<br><br>Some Common Components of Japanese Kimono:<br>-tabi<br>-zouri [fancier] or geta [more often casual]<br>-obijime<br>-obi<br>-obiage<br>-nagajyuban [longer version] / hanjyuban [halfsized version] / hadajyuban [goes directly on skin]<br>-dateeri / kasaneeri<br>-datejime<br>-erishin<br><br>all of these pieces are layered and layered on, with furisode [the most formal of the kimono other than the oofurisode] having many layers and huge extravagant prints perfect for the winter weather, and yukata [the most casual and easy to put on] having minimal layers for the summer season, and being often in cooler colors such as blues, greens, faded browns, with simple patterns for the summer weather. <br><br>Anyway, watching the evolution of fenty beauty was really neat, keep up the great content! Sorry for the unrelated ramblings in the comments section but I thought it was relevant enough to splurge all this info the best I could to fellow viewers who might be interested haha.",41400,3209896,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I always thought of Fenty Beauty as a sophisticated and chic brand, and that release ruined it imo. Too Much Mouth made a video about it and she put it very well. It came off as gimmicky and out of touch from the usual branding. Their marketing is usually effective with staying relevant by keeping up with trends, but this one was done in a tacky way imo",41400,3209896,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

This historical context is essential to understanding the plight of Palest*n*ans. For over 70 years, Palest*n*ans have endured displacement, restricted movement, and lived under harsh conditions. The term “apartheid” aptly describes the segregation and discrimination they face in their own land, marked by numerous Isra*li checkpoints. Despite countless peaceful attempts, oppression persists, leading to further land loss and human suffering. It’s important to note that Ham*as, often a focus of international attention, emerged as a response to active resistance against this enduring injustice.

Companies have even their signature red colour (Chanel, Armani etc). As someone who’s also working in the business it’s essential to follow the trend and do what works for other companies. It’s normal. Kylie built a makeup company before Rihanna, but I would never say that Rihanna followed Kylie. I love Rihanna and I use her products, I have never tried a Kylie product though, but that video is ... let’s say not nice and doesn’t make sense. It’s a hate video where you diss one person to support another. It is not necessary. I also love Rihanna’s products and I have never bought a Kylie product BUT i would never diss one and support another. What for? Especially saying „Kylie follows the Black Trend“ was the moment when I was just doing 😒... Following „black trend“ would be a smart move if the country’s majority is black and/or the majority of wealthy countries who can buy expensive products were black.  None of it it applies. Arab Emirates are the only darker skinned wealthy people at the moment. I’m sure in the future a lot will change but strategies are developed for current situations.   I think it’s great that finally companies understand that they should create products not only for ppl with west European look (which doesn’t apply anymore because now in west Europe we have people with different looks: Indians, Africans, Arabs, Asians etc) which means that Europeans don’t look like they looked few hundreds years before and Rihanna was indeed the first who embraces and celebrates all looks and heritages. God bless her for that. Aameen.",1330000,529408990,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

To be honest everyone and including her are jumping on that band wagon of talking about this topic. Yes, I agree what tarte did was wrong... they should&#39;ve just kept to one formula and had a large amount of shades for us WOC. Tarte did what they did how about the other brands that doesn&#39;t have that extend of colors for us WOC? Why not talk about the other brands? Why is Tarte being in the spotlight! Maybe some might disagree what I&#39;m saying but let&#39;s be honest I&#39;m right, aren&#39;t I? We shouldn&#39;t just talk about what one brand did when there are plenty of others that are doing the same and no one is acknowledging them. For example &quot;Shape Tape&quot; didn&#39;t have that wide range of shades but no one talked about that. Yes it is 2018 no brands should have the excuse as to why they can&#39;t cater for us WOC but if everyone is speaking about fenty, nars, bobbi brown, etc having shades for them then why fuss about tarte go to those brands that cater for you. This is a bunch of bull, I can honestly say I fall under the WOC but I ain&#39;t going to fret over something when I can just go to another brand.",466000,79813813,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

No harm to animals at all! <br>Bobbi Brown - Not Cruelty Free <br>Glossier - Cruelty Free <br>Estee Lauder - Not Cruelty Free <br>Huda Beauty - Cruelty Free except for their Lashes. <br>L&#39;oreal - Not Cruelty Free. <br>This is just to show a different perspective on things. I have somewhere close to a NC42 complexion as well so it&#39;s likely that I would have a hard time finding a great match for myself now with the present shade range. That being said, I&#39;d much rather wait for them to expand their shade range and buy their Cruelty Free products than purchase from Nars or Mac or Bobbi Brown or Makeup Forever because that comes down to ethics. As you mentioned, there are other brands on the market that do offer more shade ranges. Fenty, Cover FX, Bare Minerals do a good job at that so its not critical if there is one less foundation with a great shade range. Animal cruelty is not okay, animals shouldn&#39;t have to suffer or die for the makeup we choose to purchase and put on our faces. With every dollar that we give to a Non Crulety Free and/or Non vegan brand, we are choosing to have thousands of animals killed. Just google &#39;testing make-up on animals&#39; or even on youtube, please enlighten yourself. Have a nice day.",466000,79813813,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

I understand that some of you on here don&#39;t find it fair that Tarte is being called out but it has to start somewhere . We need more diversity in make up industry  and in  clothing campaigns we need to see more women of different complexions ages sizes and shapes . This movement that&#39;s taking place is huge . I 100 percent agree with you about certain companies pickings the same influencers. I also believe that the same influences are turning the blind eye because they don&#39;t want to loose endorsements Which is sad because they don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s more than just about the money and influences . They are getting older and these companies will stop dropping them it&#39;s about so much more!!!,466000,79813813,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"

It would be foolish to think that they overlooked the lack of medium to darker shades. Clearly, they need to employ a more diverse group to help make these decisions. They need to regroup and rethink how they will go from here.  It&#39;s almost self sabotage , why wouldn&#39;t a brand want to be all inclusive,?

Situations like these call for open dialogue more so than bashing and boycotting and bullying you tubers for their choices. It is perfectly okay to voice opinions and take a stand but we all have something to say. I especially like the point that other youtubers have mentioned (eg Makeba) that we should also celebrate black owned brands/those that have been catering to women of color since their inception. The thing is they get no love and I’m guilty of that too. We need to have a discussion on that...are the products poor quality?

That is shameful! Cosmetics giants have the money to bring out a lot more shade range and the fact that even today most of them don&#39;t, just shows a lack of disrespect. Tarte has kickstarted a conversation that many wanted to have but wasn&#39;t courageous enough to question. I feel the new year will bring a lot of influencers to question brands for their followers instead of just keeping quiet. That itself will make a brand sit up and take notice.

Make us brown/black girls feel included. The reason darker colors don’t sell is becuAuse brands don’t make them! At my local Sephora all the darker shades of fenty beauty are consistently sold out. A friend of mine has been waiting weeks to get her color. Weeks. So dark shades sell - a company just has to make them. <br>I will not be buying from tarte again.

In some of your videos ive seen you ranting about dark shades but those are supposed to go on brown skin. Those companies never included products for dark skin. Which i totally agree with you about inclusivity. <br>And i think from the start the world had this twisted idea of using makeup to cover dark color to get a fair/lighter skin which was so wrong. So every one was coming out with whiter/ fairer foundations. I think<br>1: dark skin products were not inclusive because the world thought whats the point of making it lighter <br>2: dark skinned people have beautiful countoured face with highlighted features which doesnt need makeup. <br>But everyone now a days need makeup so brands like fenty are doing something for it. <br>Here in india/pakistan we still try to cover our brown skin with fair foundation thinking it’s beautiful. <br>We need to understand the core idea behind makeup when it started when it was just white powder with a puff.,441000,217534108,"Diversity, Racial Inclusivity"
