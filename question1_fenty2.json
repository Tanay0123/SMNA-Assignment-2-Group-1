        "text": "So I was at the mall this weekend and went into Ulta specifically for Fenty foundation. Because I heard how so many people love this stuff. I was greeted by an employee who offered assistance. \n\nHe said that it is super full coverage (which is fine) and it doesn\u2019t budge (also fine) and it doesn\u2019t come off even when sweating.  That is would be cakey. His tone made it seem like I was priming a house. That it would be a giant PIA to use.\nThen tries to sell me the IT CC cream (which I already have). Then he pushes $50 primer. \n\nI want a dewy/full coverage foundation. If that is possible.  I admit, I also wanted to try this product and to try something new. I don\u2019t know what the heck I want! My concern is it feels really heavy. Again don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible with full coverage.\n\nI dunno makeup peeps. I have combo skin, more oily in the summer. I am going to a wedding and visiting in laws in Florida for a week at the end of the month, so sweat-proof may prove helpful. I live in the Midwest as well.\n\nI currently use Elf poreless primer, It CC cream, and Clinique cleansers, serum, moisturizers. \n\nThoughts? Feelings? Personal experience?",

            "I have the fenty foundation and its super matte for me so if you're looking for dewy its not the way to go. Its too matte for me so i only use it when i mix it with the miliani conceal and perfect foundation and i really like that combination. I live in florida and the mix works well for me when its really hot out while giving a more satin finish. \n\nmy skin type is combo with an oily t-zone when its hot.",
            "Are you talking about the Fenty Pro Filt'r? It's super matte, not dewy at all. Also it oxidizes like mad.",
            "The Fenty foundation was a return for me. It was SO DRYING. Have u tried DoubleWear?",
            "Have you tried a dewy setting spray? I use NYX spray with Sephora best skin ever foundation and it\u2019s a good blend.",
            "I used to use the Fenty foundation and now I use the It Cosmetics Cc cream. I like both for different reasons and functions. They are both super pigmented which is great but the Fenty does dry down very quickly and the It Cosmetics doesn\u2019t dry down enough lol. Both are fine as far as all day wear but the it cosmetics transfers really badly. I do look more dewy as a result so I just deal with it. I also like that the Cc cream has spf 50 and anti aging properties plus I have been using liquid bronzer so the fact that it doesn\u2019t dry down super fast actually works better for me so I have time to blend the products together. Bottom line is that they\u2019re both great but just in different ways and depending on how you do your makeup will depend on whether or not it works for your routine. They\u2019re both in my top 5 as far as foundations go. Fenty is lightweight matte full coverage and It is creamy hydrating full coverage.",
            "I don\u2019t know what my deal is. Fenty oxidizes on me terribly. I\u2019ve tried the foundation in 3 colors and the tinted moisturizer thing. No matter what, I\u2019m orange in a few hours. I\u2019ve never had that happen with another brand. I do use the ID CC luminous or whatever formula. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to the dewey full coverage look I like as well.",
            "Maybe looks at Double Wear. Also very full coverage but just looks beautiful on. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dewey, but it plays well with other products so you could get a dewy look with primers and hilighters.",

Pretty much like that OP has there . \n\nFor reference I was NC 20-25 on average and pretty bright and it just looked like I have mud of my face or I was in a sand storm.  \n\nCame late 2000s it got better with MAC around , so at least the undertone was closer but the MUAs still like to put you half or one shade darker to \u2018 give you a bit of glow \u2018. \n\nI don\u2019t know why offen counter salesperson always assume \n\n1) people wanna look tanned / bronze all the time \n2) if you are not white you have to either bronze or gets the warmest undertone foundation .",

Sephora lighting isn\u2019t usually the best and it makes it harder to colour match people so it\u2019s always best to see results in natural lighting \u263a\ufe0f as a Sephora employee I tend to try neutral shades on clients quite often because not many people are super warm or super cool, and I even swatch at least one cool tone, one warm tone and one neutral tone in the appropriate shade range for the client and then let the colours sit for a minute or so before the client checks the swatches and chooses the one they love. Some brands may for example have foundations that run \u2018warm\u2019 or oxidise a little too soon so it can still be a trial and error process to get the most suitable colour match! Us olive-toned people do have a bit of difficulty sometimes I agree haha \ud83d\ude01",
            "I always get color matched as darker and more yellow than I am. I don\u2019t get it. I had someone insist that I needed shade 4 or 5 in CT flawless filter. I ended up buying in shade 2. Every foundation they try to sell me is really dark and golden. I think their brains break when they see the olive undertone and they assume olive equals medium skintone",

I have 0 pink undertones and I have no idea how she arrived at that conclusion.

A really light olive and a dark golden color.\n\nI had finished my makeup for a party and she asked me to touch up her dark spots. I dabbed some of the light foundation on her face and it *disappeared* into her skin. \n\nIf I hadn't just finished putting my face on, I would have sobbed in jealousy.",
            "Yup. I wonder if some beauty store employees try not to suggest lighter shades because they don't want to seem like they're selling the idea of lighter-skinned beauty, but then maybe overcompensate and go full orange. But lighting is also tricky. I look gray under fluorescents but in any sunlight that's not overcast or noontime-bright, I look yellow-golden.",

            "I have the opposite problem. Sometimes Sephora employees give me a foundation that is 2 or 3 shade lighter. I think that I look way lighter than I actually am and when I put it on I look really ashy. Especially because my face is lighter than my body (exfoliation and so on). But they always give me golden foundations so for the most part it happens to me too.",
            "Sephora isn\u2019t going to have employees that know about olive shades. Olive is so nuanced it\u2019s sometimes hard to recognize if you\u2019re not olive yourself. \n\nI\u2019ve been color matched so many times and it\u2019s always been orange. :/ \n\nAlso the lighting in there is just bad. You have to swatch and go outside with a mirror.",
            "In their defense, the lighting in every Sephora I've ever been to was horrific, but yeah that's way off.\n\nLast time someone tried to color match me (at MAC), they put Studio Radiance N0 on me. You know, the shade with the fair redhead model. I'm medium to tan, but the person insisted on matching my neck, which is the lightest part of my whole body (but I'm sure is still at least NC20). It was ghastly and would have looked like clown makeup if it weren't a sheer product.",
            "OMG. That\u2019s what every rep no matter the brand does to me. Freaking I\u2019m not orange man! I\u2019d always feel like a loon for buying several shades off from their match. The Est\u00e9e Lauder rep used some gadget and even that clocked me full orange.",
            "It\u2019s happened to me. My face has redness but it\u2019s clear that I am not pink undertones. The damn Sephora lady argued with me and convinced me I\u2019ve been wrong my whole life. Guess who went home with a terrible match?? This sub makes me feel seen!",
            "255 is so dark on you! I don't know what they were thinking. On another note I would have guessed you wore a deeper shade than me and I wear 145. It just goes to show how important it is to not pigeonhole people's skin tones. The 130 blends into your skin so nicely. I wish makeup associates would listen to what people think they are since we've all tried lots of different shades and at least have an idea of what looks good.",
            "Sephora employees have also historically not believed me when I promised them I was olive. So, like you, I\u2019ve become an expert color matcher haha",
            "Because I have very high contrast and my face is lighter than my body, sephora employees always push a shade that\u2019s neutral or pink undertoned and way too light for me. When I went in to get the light reflecting foundation from nars the employee was like \u201coh you\u2019re totally oslo or mont blanc\u201d then I swatched those plus gobi on my neck and they all looked so light lol then I swatched fiji and deauville and deauville was the closest match (although it\u2019s not olive, I would say it\u2019s olive friendly since it has a muted yellow undertone and I can fix it with the tiniest amount of blue mixer).",
            "The reason I don\u2019t get matched professionally. I\u2019ve flat out had numerous people tell me \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as olive skin you\u2019re yellow toned in denial\u201d and then they\u2019d get pissed that too yellow a tone makes me look ill. Went years thinking I was neutral and wondering why foundation etc never looked good on me. Until I befriended a girl from South Korea in uni who urged me to try her foundation and it was literally perfect. I just remember the time I got my makeup done professionally for prom and I literally walked out looking like I\u2019d had a terrible spray tan it was so dark on me and ended up taking it all off on the train and going sans makeup (apart from bronzer and eyeliner otherwise I would\u2019ve looked like a corpse)",

            "I have never been accurately shade matched at ulta or Sephora. They try, but they just mess it up somehow. Either they think I\u2019m warm, they think I\u2019m cool, or they just go way too light for my skin and the makeup is PROMINENT. Frustrating, but I\u2019m happy you were able to color match yourself! 130 looks amazing on you.",

Our stores had floor to ceiling windows across the entire front of the store, of course we were much better at matching, WE COULD SEE!",
            "In winter when I\u2019m pale all they see if my rosacea I guess because I get matched with the way too light, way too pink cool foundation and in summer according to beauty counters I\u2019ve changed undertones because somehow I now need the orangest foundation they\u2019ve got.  I don\u2019t want pink or orange, but usually I just end up mixing 3 foundations together, adding blue mixer and then hoping it doesn\u2019t oxidize.",

L'ancome says if enough people contact them, they'll bring it back. I know I'm not alone in this as I've spoken with many light olive gals who miss this color too, and see posts about it in this very forum.\n\nI've tried Haus Labs, IT, everything else on the market, and while Lady Gaga's Haus Labs has a similar color as does Beauty Blender Bounce tint (Light 4), the formulas do not compare to L'ancome Skin Feels Good for everyday use!!! I do love the Beauty Blender tint, it's amazing, BUT it is far too heavy for everyday wear, more like a build able medium to heavy coverage foundation, and if I leave it on too long I get breakouts. That was NEVER the case with L'ancome Skin Feels Good. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nL'ancome Skin Feels Good benefits: light coverage but buildable to medium, perfect alone or as a base primer for foundation, NO breakouts, perfectly even tone, no texture, no pore visibility, healthy natural glow but never too shiny nor too matte, and feels like virmatter, nothing is on your skin + real skin health benefits! It's good for dry AND oily skin. I've been using it since the time I had oily/acne prone skin, to now in my 40s where I'm a bit dry and I'm telling you it was the best. I've fallen asleep with it on and woke up with my skin in excellent condition. No tint, no matter how supposedly beneficial, has ever given me that effect or made me feel like I could actually sleep in makeup.\n\nPlease call L'ancome and help get this color back on the market. 1-800-526-2663. I know there are more of you out there who are sad about this.\n\nIn the meantime I've been going to Sephoras and asking for samples of it since no store has it in stock anymore. I'm getting dangerously low and I've tried literally every other product under the sun in the meantime, as well as every other L'ancome shade. Nothing compares."

As such, I religiously use sunscreen, cover my face with hats, and I do use retinol, making me even paler. \n\nI am so excited to see the range of very fair tones here. If I pick the palest shade of most face products, it's usually too deep and yellow on me (looking at you IT Cosmetics). If the coverage is poor, it won't cover the redness for more than a couple hours as well. I'm so glad they seem to care about the people on the very fair and very deep ends. I know we are in the minority (with most people clustering toward the middle \"normal\" shades), but there are still enough of us, and we get ignored by most brands.",

In the 15 yrs I spent doing makeup, only cover fx came close to a powder this dark, and I almost never got to work on super dark complexions.

I just sweat it off and it doesn't do nicely on my nose when it sweats. Looking forward to using it again.\n\nEdit: so I went back to my tarte Amazonian clay foundation, which was great until winter came along and it highlighted my dry skin. So once it gets cold again I'll go back to photofocus. ",

I also have very oily skin but embracing it seems to work out better for me.\n\nThough the foundation is nice, its a few bucks more than this one. Anyway, I guess what I mean to ask is do you think the formula of this is more matte or dewy? How do you like it on your skin?\n\nAlso I wear a 220 in the Maybelline foundation and this one looks pretty similar. Did it oxidize at all?",
            "Just wanted to share the amazing find! I was skeptical because of the price point but as the kids say, I was shook! It\u2019s the Wet n Wild Photofocus Foundation (as the pic shows).\n\nI\u2019ve been on a foundation hunt since finishing my Maybelline Fit Me Matte and Poreless (which was ok but had alcohol in it and I\u2019d get super oily 4 hours into it and it wears away on my nose) two weeks ago, and have been sampling everything:\n\n* Fenty Pro Filter\n* Nars ADLW\n* Lanc\u00f4me Tenit Idole\n* MAC Studio Fox Fluid\n* Makeup Forever Matte Velvet\n* Kat Von D Lock It (not condoning her anti-vax stance!)\n\nAnd after watching some reviews of the Photofocus I decided to give it a try since I\u2019m such a big fan of Wet n Wild\u2019s contour kit and brow powder, and it was so cheap! I was fully prepared for the paint smell but it goes away as soon as you put it on.\n\nI like the paddle application because it\u2019s just much cleaner than getting my hands dirty after pouring it out, and I can precisely spread it out where I want it before going in with a brush to buff it in. It gives me medium to super full coverage if I build it up. I know some people say unhygienic but I\u2019m just using it on my own face and people really have no problem using doe foot applicators of a concealer directly on the face sooo \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019ve worn it for 11 hours straight thus far (could go longer but I was done with makeup for the day), with these other products/steps and it held up in the southern heat and on my oily skin (though I didn\u2019t do anything too strenuous to get sweaty and only was outside to and from the car, the heat still isn\u2019t a joke!):\n\n1. Australian Gold Tinted Botanical Face Sunscreen as all over Face primer (which works beautifully btw!)\n2. Black Radiance Shine Control Primer on my cheeks/Nose to control oil\n3. Milani Eye Primer on the tip of my nose to control oil \n4. Setting the oily areas again with Maybelline Shine Control Loose Powder\n5. Foundation (WnW Photofocus in this case but I take these same steps for all my other foundations)\n6. Setting the foundation with the Rimmel Stay Matte Translucent Powder\n\nThe foundation is so easy to blend (which isn\u2019t the case , it starts out as a satin matte but I always set all my foundations like I said, and it stays that way all the way till I take it off. My tip of the nose maybe gets a tinnyyyyyy bit oily towards the end but just powdering it again makes it good as new, no wearing away at all (which was a problem with the Maybelline Fit Me one) It has a very similar velvety matte finish to the Fenty one but even more airbrushed as it wears! \n\nI\u2019ve tried L\u2019oreal Pro Matte before (which gives the dry as a desert matte skin, kinda hard to blend even), which incidentally had the same formula as the newly released NYX Can\u2019t Stop Won\u2019t Stop \u2014 that I almost bought but was too impatient to wait anymore to get, so I impulsively bought the WnW one. And I\u2019m so glad I did! It\u2019s litereally 1/3 of the price of the NYX one and I\u2019m glad that they waited so long to release it cause now I won\u2019t be getting it :o (I\u2019ve been hyping myself up for the NYX one for the past month before impulsively getting the WnW over the weekend!)\n",

Extremely well balanced and complementing your colour palette well.\n\nI might add just a smidge more of light peach blush for a little bit of color. The benefit of a light blush is that it will wear off throughout the day and give you a glow from within look. \nI think your eye makeup is super fab, especially the golden with the soft brown smoke. If you want to see how it will wear into the evening, put a black and white filter on your photos and check where the darkness is more. Usually those areas smudge out on me during the day. Just as a little bit of advice, so that you can carry your eyeshadow in case you need to touch up.",

            "Gentle and elegant \u2026 maybe breath of peach in the eyeshadow. Very pretty",

            "So lovely!!  I think a bit more rosy pink hue in your lip shade would make it perfect!",
            "This is lovely. The only feedback I have is that the undertone of your brown eyebrow powder/pencil is quite warm while your hair has a cooler, ash undertone. I would go with a less warm-toned eyebrow product.",
            "Beautiful! Yes i agree on putting a bit more makeup for photos. You can add some color too! Rosy, pinky or peach to either one of lip or cheeks. Then a tiny sparkle somewhere like cheeks or eyes \u2764\ufe0f",
            "The only thing I would suggest is getting your eyebrows cleaned up!",
            "Wow you look a bit like Sarah Michelle geller! Stunning makeup. Congratulations!",
            "You look so beautiful! Truly otherworldly.\n\nI do agree with other commenters that a pop of blush would bring even more light and life to the look, but this is one of the loveliest bridal looks I\u2019ve seen!",
            "Best makeup for a wedding I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I would clean up eyebrows but you look great!",

            "Looking fabulous! Your makeup already has that magical touch. Maybe just a hint more blush to match the glow in your smile?",
            "Honestly, I think it's perfect! While you could add more blush, you don't need it. Your radiance comes through. What I see is a beautiful and happy person, that's when you know the makeup is perfect.",

            "You are so gorgeous like a fairy doll! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd79",
            "A tiny bit more blush and tidy up your brows and I think you\u2019re golden. This is a really beautiful soft glam look. You did a great job!",
            "I love this. I'm literally saving your pictures for if I ever get married haha!",
            "This looks perfectly done, and omg you have beautiful eyes!",
            "I think this looks beautiful. Just a little more blush would make it perfect!",
            "You look beautiful! If you're curious about how well it will show up on their camera, it may be worth getting in touch with your wedding photographer adlnd getting their opinion as well. \n\nWishing you and your intended much happiness on your special day!!! \ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83c\udf82\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a (apparently there's no wedding cake emoji on my phone\ud83d\ude05)",

            "Absolutely perfect!",
            "In general looks nice color wise but the net effect of eyes in pic #1 is trending downward droop instead of upward..open eye a bit more try simply first maybe just a hit of a lighter shade of shadow just below brown arch and a slightly lighter highlight -of even slightly lighter foundation or powder on about above upper corner outer corner of brow bone blending up/out toward hairline...its done very subtly to caste a bit of light upward.  \n   Also, although great brows perhaps could be quick fix by not carrying brow tails down so heavily/low & slightly lighter upper lid color. \n   In general, everything looks great, well done.  I would try with just adding the under brow arch touch of lighter color to highlight & the upper above brow toward highline small highlight to raise focal point & a more open eye effect.  You look lovely.",
            "Everything looks great except for the eyebrows- straiten the bottom line so they do not look wiggly.",
            "Personally no notes. Saw the first pic and it felt complete. You're a natural beauty with uniquely amazing eyes. They shine so bright in this makeup. And it feels that whenever you smile it's really well highlighted by the lipstick. It's a 10/10 from me. A truly beautiful person",
            "I love how your freckles still shine through!",
            "You look like a number one stunner for sure. Everything flatters your features perfectly. You did a fantastic job. Well done.",
            "I swear this is the nicest makeup I\u2019ve seen.. you would have to pay tons to have this done with proper products in my area..",
            "Maybe a tad darker on the crease of the eye shadow! Perhaps darker contour/blush cause of flash photography?",
            "oh no way i didn\u2019t have a clue this was self applied. you did a LOVELY job. congratulations!",
            "This looks great! The only change i would make is I would try to make the eyebrows a little more fuller and potentially more symmetrical with eyebrow pencil. I would also switch whatever pencil you\u2019re using now, for a cooler tone of eyebrow pencil. This currently looks a little too warm for your skin tone and hair.",
            "That's going to translate really well in your professional photos, but it's subtle enough that it still looks fresh for in-person. My first impression was the lip was a bit dark for you, but that *always* looks better in greyscale or sepia photos, or editing that includes a dreamy haziness. It depends on your photographer's editing style, really. If the photos are intended to be very crisp and true to life, I'd find a lip shade that edges more towards peach, just ever so slightly lighter than what you're wearing.\n\nThe rest is perfection, I wouldn't change a thing. Your eyes especially look amazing; it's a lot of product you've got listed, but the eyes just *work* for you, so depending on your lifestyle, that could easily be a daily makeup.",
            "Honestly, this looks much better than most professional work i\u2019ve seen. You look gorgeous. Very beautifully done!! \u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f",
            "What mascara did you use?? You look flawless!!\n\nAgreed on a bit of eyebrow gel and some more blush, but wow. It looks perfect on your and the colors look magnificent on your complexion. You have Disney eyes!",
            "Wow! You guys have all been so lovely! I was truly worried about posting and I\u2019m so thankful for all the feedback! I will clean up the brows, add more blush, play around with more pinky lipstick and saw a few comments for more orange blush so I\u2019ll try that as well! \n\nI saw some comments about my eye lashes and I curled with a normal curler then just the Lanc\u00f4me Hypnose mascara but I have been using grande lash for about a year now. Some of my friends have picked it up and some like it and some don\u2019t. The lady I bought my dress from said it irritated her eyes so if you try it get the smaller bottle first just in case. Also they have better sales around the holidays. \n\nThank you all again!! I truly truly appreciate all the kind words and helpful feedback! This is a gem of a subreddit to be on!",
            "Love it, looks great! Hair I like conceptually, am a little concerned it's a bit loose and needs a few more pins.",
            "That wedding makeup is spot on! \n\nJust want to add; those cheap lash serums really work and with your long lashes, I could only imagine the results\n\nMine's from ivy, was 10 usd and took about three weeks and my lashes are fuller, stronger and longer.",
            "The camera takes away a lot of the makeup in the photos, so unless the intention is to look almost makeup-free in the photos, I would make it darker. Either way, you are a gorgeous bride!",
            "Omg I thought you were Chelsea from love is blind",
            "Beautiful composition, the color pallet suits you well,  adding a bit more blush will definitely elevate the look even more , and congratulations",

            "Stunning!",
            "You look so pretty. Everything from the hair and makeup to the dress (from what I can see) is stunning!",
            "Omg I love seeing a bride without the bronze/orange Smokey eye makeup. Your eyes pop and sparkle! Maybe a smidge more blush but other than that perfect!",
            "You look so wonderful, you're absolutely glowing!! I wish you the best wedding and happiest of marriages. Congrats!",
            "Omg you're so pretty!",

I want that wow effect! a bit more eye liner on the top lash line, focus on your outer corners mainly when adding. I would use a small eyeliner brush and a ink gel liner in chocolate or brown.

            "hey, deliciously lubricated skin is a blessing, but can give makeup application a steeper initial learning curve when you are beginning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting with skincare, after washing face in morning / simply lightly rinsing with water -(whatever you do) :\n\n* hydrate with a sheer moisturiser that dries down - or even better a hyaluronic acid toner (The Ordinary's 'Marine Hyaluronics' option, is one I find is great at completely drying down).\n* if you are using a sunscreen with hyaluronic acid or which has hydrating elements - you might even skip the above first step. Do try to pick a sunscreen that is a mattifying face version, even with its hydrating ingredients.\n* Then primer. I recently becan using & love the Milk Hydrogrip. I am not sure if it is marketed as 'for oily skin' but it lengthens my 'no-shiny face' period quite a bit. There might be other options you prefer though that are even more mattifying.\n* If you are not priming with a mattifying primer in above step - then do the old-school matte trick of lightly powdering the face & then spraying with a mattifying makeup seal spray BEFORE you apply makeup. WayneGoss and many other makeup artists have [vids on this step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyQsVyGadbY).\n* Then do your makeup, using a mattifying foundation - or mixing your foundation in with a mattifying primer to sheer out the coverage. Perhaps also pick powder bronzers/contours/blushes (or at least set cream versions of these with a powder version)\n* then dust all t-zone & face with setting powder again (\\*NB, 'setting powder', not 'finishing powder')\n* Then re-seal again with a makeup setting spray (\\*NB: Mac FIX + is not a setting spray, fix+ works by lightly dissolving excess makeup to make the look more 'perfected' - a setting spray would be like the urban decay setting spray or many other alternatives like this).\n* Then .... you have the best base you can hope for - bring blotting papers with you to dab away excess oil at midday & a travel edit of a setting powder to lightly dust over the top at midday too to re-mattify.\n\nthis looks super complex - but it isn't really!\n\nSuch a small price to pay for your amazing super self-lubricating skin that will protect you so much better than \"normal\" or \"dry\" skin, in both anti-aging wrinkles aspects and general skin health aspects.  - so actually you are so blessed! haha:) xx\n\n:)",

I wore this same one for some time and it even worked on my combo-oily skin! It's pretty pricey at $48, but going on Murad's website can save you 20% off + free shipping right now.

I've been trying to sort my face out for many, many years and I've noticed that every time I use skincare for oily skin, my face actually turns really oily, when I use skincare for dry skin, my face turns dry. \n\nI've looked it up and apparently, skin adapts, so when using products for oily skin (like a mattifying moisturizer or foundation) your skin will balance itself by producing MORE oil to counteract the drying product. Same with dry skin products, adding too much moisture will make the skin produce so little oil that it'll turn dry, and so on. \n\nThe Fenty foundation is very matte, iirc? So that could potentially make your face even oilier than it should be, especially if you're not using something to put the moisture back in your skin.",
            "Face primer. Let absorb in skin for at least 5 to 10 min. Too much foundation.  Layer it lightly to build up coverage.  Then spray a setting spray like urban decay all nighter. Don't go cheap on primers amd setting sprays.   Go to sephora or ulta and see if they still give out different kinds of primer samples for oily skin.   I layer primers.  I use a primer moisturizer and a primer glow. AND. Mid summer I also use a mattifying primer (sephora brand) around my T-zone. You have to do skun Carer and moisturize regularly.  Your skin is over producing oils becoming oily bc its actually thirsty. \nIF YOU WANT TO START WITH CHEAP PRIMER....MILK OF MAGNESIA TUMMY MEDICINE. I swear.  Add a tiny bit of water to it.

            "Setting powder is a holy grail for me. Get one skin tone friendly and lightly brush over your face. Or you could bake. And you can use it multiple times to freshen up your makeup. Make sure to use matte products. Also check your primer and foundation ingredients. If the first/second ingredient is water, it\u2019s water based; if it\u2019s some type of oil, it is oil based. Pair water based primer with water based foundation and vice versa because water and oil don\u2019t mix, they separate causing even more gross makeup.",

            "I see a lot of comments on this thread about moisturizing which, as a fellow oily girl, is definitely crucial advice. Ideally you need a non comedogenic (pore clogging) moisturizer, so I recommend going for a gel moisturizer as many others have already suggested. Be wary of hyaluronic acid as an ingredient since if you don\u2019t have any moisture already on your face prior to applying it it can end up just pulling the moisture from your skin and making your drier. If you want to use a hyaluronic acid, use a toner or essence that can put a little moisture back on first or keep your face slightly wet from washing.\n\nWashing your face was my main concern here. I haven\u2019t seen anyone comment yet about cleansing which is something I feel made a strong difference in my skin when I was trying to figure out a skincare routine that worked for me. You need a gentle cleanser that won\u2019t strip your skin so much that your face feels dry and tight after washing. Stripping your skin of its oils to this degree is going to further encourage your skin to go overboard with the oil production.",

            "you\u2019re so beautiful!!!! green is definitely your colour, maybe practice on the liner a bit to sharpen it up and use mascara to really give an extra pop. even a light coat would do. once again you\u2019re gorgeous!!!",
            "I would be honest and say at this point your eye makeup skills aren\u2019t that great yet but that\u2019s okay because it\u2019s something that takes a lot of practice AND you are really naturally pretty! So you could totally go with less eye makeup and wear just mascara even. Try not to bring the eyeshadow down so far in the inner corner and bottom lid. Also the tail ends of your liquid eyeliner looks fine just practice getting the eyeliner as close to the lashes as you can, and add some more mascara if you\u2019re going to do thick eyeliner! Otherwise I would say your brows and skin look great!\n\nEyeshadow is completely personal preference but since you seem to have green/hazel eyes like me I would completely recommend looking up \u201cmakeup for hazel eyes\u201d and look at some of the colors! Personally I think us hazel eyes look best in warm browns, peachy colors, and mauve/purples. I also love a warm champagne color with a little sparkle in it. Those colors really brings out the greens.",
            "I think this look is stunning! The only things I\u2019d say are blend the green out a little more with a lighter shade around the eye so it doesn\u2019t look so sharp. The lip liner also looks a little darker on the top so maybe you could try to blend it out along the lip line and blot out the lipstick along the lips (I always find that blotting the lip looks so naturally beautiful). If you don\u2019t want to do that then I\u2019d say put liner around the outside and a little into the sides of the lips and put a lighter shade in the middle for dimension. Beautiful job tho \u2764\ufe0f congratulations on coming out, you are effortlessly beautiful and green really suits you.",

So for a green lid and crease I would either do a lighter green, a yellow, or an orange on the inner corner.",

Half false lashes would add to the glam and I\u2019m super partial to adding more pinky blush (but you can ignore me on that since I love to over blush)",

            "FIRST OF ALL - you are beautiful and look amazing. \n\nI really love the green but I think there's room for improvement - try a gold or something other than green (or a really light green?) on the inner corner to give it some dimension, and blend it a bit more as it comes up above your lid. \n\nMaybe thin out the eyeliner a bit, and more mascara for sure.",
            "First of all: Gorgeous!! \n\nI think you've got your base down! Time to experiment with highlights & blush/sculpting if you want - n remember less is more. You can always put more on but omg try to remember to tap the brush off every time. Sometimes we learn the hard way though heh. We delete those pictures, it's fine. \n\nAgree with everyone saying the look needs mascara/ a softer eyeliner. I like the NYX epic ink for eyeliner, and brown is also surprisingly flattering but saying that, I only own the black atm \ud83d\ude05 also, treat yourself to a nice palette if you can tbh!!  I got a Huda one from tk maxx recently (UK equiv of TJ) and goooooood god that shit blends so easy and there are so many nice, usable shades. Having a couple small, soft and fluffy eyeshadow brushes helps too! I think you'd look mega hot with some warm toned Shadows too but I must admit I am still partial to the green, compliments your eyes so well. A bit more dimension perhaps though if anything?  Maybe try blending a brown into/ slightly above the crease as a way to elevate it. \n\nIt's all trial and error rly but this is a better lewk than some of my makeup-wearing-for-a-decade friends. And you're definitely in the right place!! Pls come back and show us, you have such a pretty face and I'm excited to see how this community helps the makeup elevate :D",

It appears you have green eyes, so maybe try some plum and grey eyeshadows to really bring them out. Finally, the real purpose of eyeliner is to make it appear that you have very thick eyelashes. Consequently, you don't want gaps in the eyeliner as others have already mentioned. Here is a tip, try tightlining. That is, take an eyeliner pencil and go UNDER just your top eyelashes. Then use your normal eyeliner on top of your eyelashes. Stay gorgeous!",

            "I\u2019d love to see you try using eyeshadow for liner instead of liquid. You want to use a skinny flat angled or straight brush. Easier for me to get right and you can always smoke it out when it goes wrong. Easier to remove and more colour options. You can also spray some setting spray on ur hand and dip ur brush in it before going into the shadow to get a crisp line. (I prefer without water but up to you)\nColour theory would also b helpful for you to know. I always put a cyan glitter in the lid when I have an orange crease since they are complimentary. You could add purple or pink glitter to this look! Or purple/pink graphic liner.",

            "you look great! for CC I personally would smooth out the eyeliner on the top lid a bit more, like just bring it a little more gradually into the corner of the eye. I usually do a full line from corner to crease. that's really more of my personal preference for a more pointed/cat eye look. looks great already though!!",

Keep doing them every day, and it'll become habit, and you will notice unexpected improvement. It all comes down to comfortability.\n\nAnd last thing but this is more of an opinion that you could totally agree or disagree with. But before you put on your eyeliner, wipe the dark eyeshadow out of the corners of your eyes, and apply some highlighter. It does wonders!\n\nAgain though I'm impressed!!!

Otherwise- you\u2019re doing WONDERFUL!!!",
            "I agree with some of the other comments above about stopping the green shadow before your inner corner and using a lighter shimmer shade on the lid or inner corner. I love wearing green shadow because my hair is green! I usually use a shade similar to yours and pack a little on the outer crease, blend out kinda in a wing and blend some along the crease towards the inner eye. I repeat the same process with a darker green but more focused on just the crease, pack a shimmery shade on the lid and good to go. If you want to do a green look with 1 shadow like you have on, pack color on the eyelid and then take a fluffy blending brush with nothing on it and blend it out focusing on the outer corner if you want that winged shape",
            "i think you look so gorgeous!! if i had to recommend something, id say give false lashes a try! they would bring out your eyes sooo much!",
            "Congrats on coming out!! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc96\n\nThe color and overall look looks fabulous on you! For CC, I'd experiment with not bringing the color all the way to the inner corners - instead add a lighter/sparklier color like a glittery gold or light pink to the inner corners \u2728",
            "You're beautiful but the green eye shadow is making me focus on that and not your actual eyes which are gorgeous",
            "Lashes would look amazing! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
            "I would agree with others about not having the green go above the crease. Or use it on the middle  of your lid as a pop.",
            "I think you look great. I agree with others about mascara: adding a few coats of mascara can also open up the eyes and hide a not-entirely-perfect application of eyeliner.\n\nYour eye color is amazing!",
            "I had to read that twice. Looking good Mrs x",
            "You are so pretty oh my god",
            "You're giving me Christi Carlson Romano vibes and I love it!",
            "Love the colors you went with!! Stunning. I find doing a pop of color just in the inner corner can balance out a look a bit more than a full lid. I also suggest making the liner a bit thinner with the exception of by the outer corner. This gives the eye a fuller more \u201cdoe\u201d like effect. But overall this is fabulous and you look GORG",
            "You look like the south Austin boho chic babysitter that I had the biggest gay tweenage crush on and didn\u2019t know what those feelings were called. \n\nSrsly tho u look amazing!! I\u2019m totally not being helpful but u look gr8",
            "My only comment is work on the eyeliner/maybe do a bit more mascara but it looks so good! Very lovely",
            "Lovely",
            "Everyone has great constructive criticism here and I love it \ud83e\udd72 you\u2019re a beautiful woman and I\u2019m so excited you\u2019re showing the world who you really are \ud83e\udd0d also, when in doubt, slap on some lashes lol",

            "You're gorgeous! Love the green shadow on you.",
            "You're gorgeous. When doing your eyeshadow, don't blend it into the inner corner of your eye. Instead, stop right before and add a dab of highlighter to let light into your eyes.",
            "You look great! My one recommendation would be maybe some lashes or mascara.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t not have even known you were trans!! Your very very pretty!\n\nIn a nice way!!! You like the wicked of Oz witch with the makeup and hat! I love your makeup green is defs your colour! I would leave the blush and contour and lips how it is it makes the eye pop anything more would make it look too much like stage makeup.",
            "I love the green color on you and lip color is great! If you want to add more make up in, you could add some contour or blush to your cheek bones because it looks like you have broadly high cheek bones and fill cheeks. This is not needed, only if you want to add in more for fun.",
            "Gorgeous! I wish I could rock a bright color like that",
            "Pretty good! In my opinion the eyeshadow extends out a little too much and is a bit too circular, but that\u2019s just me",
            "gorgeous lady, love the fashionable style\ud83e\udd70\u2665\ufe0f",
            "You\u2019re pretty much unclockable to me. Maybe change the shade of your eyeshadow?",
            " Good, but you need twenty or thirty more coats of mascara. Just keep swiping and swiping, give it a few min to firm up a bit, then add more.",
            "Very pretty and love the hair! \ud83d\udc95",
            "Wow, I\u2019d say it\u2019s perfect. You\u2019d look great with a plum lip nars danger shade would look amazing on you!",

            "You look lovely!! If you didn\u2019t say you were trans I wouldn\u2019t have thought you were! You\u2019re doing great! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f And your hair is *mwah chef\u2019s kiss* \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

            "You are stunning!!!",
            "Beautiful",
            "You look gorgeous! I like the green eyeshadow/eyeliner combo. I think trying a more subtle liner and adding more dimension to the eyeshadow (e.g. using a transition color) would make you look \"softer\".",
            "What others say about the eyeshadow\nAnd i also think you can contour your nose a bit. Not to change its shape or size. but to define it. Like you have definition on the rest of your face but your nose feels like it's lacking it. That's why contouring is important after applying foundation. But regardless you look gorgeous and this is your colour",
            "SO HOT! Love the green eyeshadow on you",
            "I actually like it as is, beautiful lady! If it was blue it\u2019d look like the Love Witch!",
            "You look very beautiful and feminine I suggest lip liner under gloss to make the pink stand out more",
            "You are killing it! The only advice I would give is to have a look at a colour chart. I can\u2019t quite tell if your eyes are blue or green, but finding your shade will make your eyes pop!

            "I think that bronzey tones of eyeshadow and blush would be amazing on you",
            "First thing is first, you are absolutely gorgeous! I'd pop a darker green in the outer corner of your top eyelid, and bring it down to just below your lower lash line. Go over the black top eyeliner one more time. Then, use a black eye pencil eyeliner on your waterline. Just small bit in the very outer corner. Maybe a highlighter in the inner corner closest to your nose. Either way. You are an absolute bombshell!",
            "I love your eyeshadow it's giving me Wicked vibes",
            "That's such a lovely green to accent your eye color. Also agree that the hair color is gorgeous",

            "You look fabulous!\nVery soft and pretty",
            "Eyeshadow base!! It will bring out the color and the application will be smoother.",
            "You look so pretty, I love the hair! Just one thing I would recommend: try to be more precise with your eyeshadow application. I struggle with this too especially having hooded lids. I think I saw a youtube short video by Glamzilla (not sure if it was her honestly)  explaining how to apply eyeshadow better. I'm sure there are other videos by other creators as well. \n\nAlso applying a layer of very light toned concealer or one of those white jumbo pencils or a white eyeshadow base will really make the bright colors look much better. Use whatever you have on hand for this.",
            "You're killin it!",
            "Oh my Lord, you are gorgeous!!",
            "If you hadnt put trans in the title lady i wouldnt have known. \n\nYou're doing fantastic \u2764\ufe0f",
            "You look amazing!!! The skill it takes to get ur foundation to look so even while dealing with shadow!!! Your base looks flawless! To me - this is a fun look & makeup is meant to be fun & is about expressing yourself. So if you want to do a bold bright more artsy look- go for it. There\u2019s editorial, artistic expression, natural.. you do you!",
            "Gosh you\u2019re so pretty omg \ud83d\ude33 Your skin and hair and makeup all look just amazing! If I had to nitpick, maybe darker mascara or trying some falsies? You look incredible my dear",
            "I love the look! Have you tried fake lashes?? They take some practice to master but i think they would be the cherry on top of the look!",
            "You look awesome! I love your aesthetic!!",
            "Not sure if thus is my personal preference but I'd continue the liner to the corner of the eye. It looks like you're stopping somewhere 1/3rd short of the tear duct and it doesn't necessarily lend the same fullness to the eye. Otherwise I love the look! The colors work wonderfully with your skin tone (I could never pull off green!)",
            "So pretty girl. You are killing it!",
            "I think you look amazing! Try to stay away from matching eyeshadow with outfits. Instead, try to use colors that compliment your complexion.",
            "Go red, gold, orange with the main color, maybe pop with the green, but the complimenting and contrast colors will pop out your gorgeous eyes. Great job on liner. Hooded eyes can be a bitch. Darken the outer corners, and highlight the inners.\nYou are a goddess.",
            "It looks like you have green eyes! I would play them up with pink and red eyeshadows. ABH Modern Renaissance is a great palette! I'd look up tutorials on YouTube! You look beautiful!",
            "Love the witchy vibes. Not sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, but you look like you should be traipsing along the cobblestone streets of Salem with a black cat named Poe.",
            "You overall look really good and it\u2019s hard to see any specific issues, but your eyeliner is a bit messy and seems to stick up a bit too much vertically? Like if it was a cleaner line and tilted downwards I bit it might look better, but besides that you look great!",
            "I think so too. I think you are quite beautiful.",

            "Hi gorgeous I am a 22F, you\u2019re beautiful however when taking pictures shoulders back and pretend to feel confident in the moment when snapping a picture.

            "You look absolutely gorgeous! I think your eyeshadow needs to be blended a lot more, especially around your inner eye where it looks like there is a lot of fallout/smudging, and you should try adding more highlights and shading to give it dimension. Stunning!",
            "no because you're so pretty im so jealous \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

            "I can't see much to critique here. I get that you're making that expression so show off the eye makeup (lovely match to your outfit BTW) but it might be an idea to post something with a more neutral expression and hair put back a little next time you need CC, it'll make it easier to see whether the shape of your brows/wings/blush is doing all it can for you.

It\u2019s stunning and feminine in all the right ways. I would be curious to see what a little smoke just above the wings and maybe the creases would do!

            "Super gorge id say a tip is to do eyes before face makeup as you can get all that loose shadow below your eyes off before your base. And in your eye corners id put a soft highlight instead of having the same amount of shadow everywhere, think a softer gradient with it being strong on the outside to softer strokes and application toward your corner for a better look\ud83d\udc9f",
            "You look great! Your hair is a pretty color and I like the lip color. \n\nI have hazel eyes and blue eye shadow makes the green pop. Green shadow with green eyes means your eye color competes with the color of the shadow. If you want your eyes to look icy light green, then this green works! If you want a big pop of eye color, blue will do the trick. \n\nMy immediate impression is that the green goes too high up on your eyelid/underbrow. Maybe it would look cool if you bring down the green on the inner (medial) eyelid and sharpen up the edges of the color, like when people with buzzed hair get a \"lineup\" around all the edges.\n\nI have trans family members, and I have observed that trans women often use very heavy makeup, sometimes to cover beard stubble, sometimes because they like it that way. I would suggest when it come to makeup, less is more. \n\nI get that some people like to experiment with makeup and like it that way. No problem! Drag makeup is fun!\n\nIf you prefer to blend in, ease off heavy makeup and blend your makeup like a pro.\n\nYou seem to be killin' it!",
            "Overall it\u2019s pretty good, but small details.\n\nTry using a lip liner/pick the lipstick with a small brush to define the lip\u2019s shape. It would look cleaner \n\nThe eyeshadow may need a bit more blending. Pick a colour that is between your skin tone and the green shadow and blend blend blend. Ideally, I shouldn\u2019t be able to notice where the shadow ends\n\nI think your eyeliner is not the best for your eye shape. But eyeliner is a lot of practice and trial and error, so keep going! And mascara will help too.",

The green eyeshadow is lovely, but it could use a little bit of depth in the outer corners and a little bit of highlight in the inner corners just for dimension, and it would tie it all together. But even if you left it as is, it's still a cute look. Congrats.",

I think 100 is a different undertone, but similarly light.\n\nI'm unable to tell whether they'd match you in depth because I don't have any of your foundations here for reference. But the undertone should be better.\n\n----\nETA: I see you tried a Fenty. 110 will be way too light then I guess. But yeah, you need pink/cool. I would strongly suggest to go to a Sephora and just swatch everything you can find there - ideally you just do it once and then buy your shade online with no more trips, but you really do have to try them out.",
            "Agree with the other comment. And don\u2019t put so much on when you try the next lot x",
            "I suggest trying something with neutral to cool undertones. Maybe L'Oreal True Match 1C might be a place to start. Other comments have already mentioned it, but I recommend using significantly less product when swatching. Even better would be to use a maximum of 4 at a time (two on each side of the face) and blend out the two. Not only would it help with giving more realistic swatch of how it'll look on your complexion, but you'll also see how the formula itself looks/feels. Plus I notice if a swatch is as thick/wet as these are it doesn't show the likelihood of a foundation oxidizing once it dries/sets.",
            "There was a lot of comments to wake up too and I want to thank everyone that helped! \ud83d\ude0a Yall have been amazing and not judgmental like any family that I asked for help from.

I bought them without knowing my undertone like a dummy. I'm going to try to head to my local Walmart or Walgreens since they are closer and see if I can find any of the recommendations you all offered and hope it's a better match!

            "Your skin color looks almost exactly like mine. I have the *hardest* time finding a good color match that also wears nicely. In the rare times that I find a great one, it eventually is discontinued and I'm back to square one. \n\nHere are two currently available items that have worked very well for me, if you want to try these. \n\nThe first one is my \"going out\" foundation if I want to look my best in person. The second is my quick \"staying in\" (or on zoom), if I just need a quick decent application. \n\n1) KVD Beauty Good Apple Lightweight Full-Coverage Cream Foundation Balm in 018 \"light\" [link](https://www.sephora.com/product/kvd-vegan-beauty-good-apple-skin-perfecting-foundation-balm-P469488)\n\n2) NYX conceal correct contour cream palette in \"light\" [link](https://a.co/d/4hIQMWS)\n\nEdit: I also was very late to the game and only started wearing makeup in my 30's -- and didn't know much about it. One very important thing to know is the prep makes or breaks the look and wear of your foundation. \n\nStart with a good moisturizer with sunscreen. Find one that feels super light. The one I liked most by neutrogena had AHA included but was just discontinued, so I'm still looking for a replacement -- but in the meantime, cerave facial moisturizing lotion spf 30 is decent. You want one that is finely milled and when you apply it almost disappears and doesn't leave a layer that you can feel. This is critical or your foundation won't sit right on top. [link](https://www.target.com/p/cerave-face-moisturizer-with-sunscreen-am-facial-moisturizing-lotion-for-normal-to-dry-skin-spf-30-2-fl-oz/-/A-76545851)\n\nThen add a base / primer over the moisturizer, and under the foundation. This grips the foundation and helps it last. I usually use Laura Mercier pure canvas primer, but lately I've experimented with some drug store brands and like Elf power grip primer, and also Elf poreless putty primer -or - Elf matte putty primer. \n\nLastly - and most importantly IMHO, after foundation you need to set the application with a high quality *translucent* powder. There are a lot of options and I've tried many, but the one that always looks best to me is Laura Mercier translucent setting powder. I also use a translucent powder by Elf that looks pure white, but goes on invisibly. I don't remember the name and I threw out the packaging so not sure what it was called. \n\nDon't ever skip steps. When I first started using foundation I initially thought no way, no how am I going to use primer or powder. I thought it was just the store trying to upsell me and I always said thanks but no thanks. Now that I know better after 20 years of using make up, I never skip the primer or setting powder. If I do; the end result looks bad or doesn't wear very long. \n\nI generally have two kits: my primary kit is for when I'm going to work or out for the night, and I want to look my very best. And the other kit is my quick, cheap and good enough stuff -- for packing up to go, or for a quickie application when I'm working from home and just need to barely pass for being on a zoom call. \n\nOne last tip: a great set of brushes is critical and can make or break your foundation application. \n\nFor applying foundation I use Kat van Dee #10 (I borrowed it from my daughter, and never returned it, ha ha). This is an awesome and unique brush and I will never go back after using it. [link here](https://a.co/d/0i9Ly1O)\n\nHow to: Apply moisturizer/ sunscreen - let it fully dry down before applying the primer and let that dry down before applying the foundation (each layer might take a few mins to dry down -- don't rush this part or you won't get the best final result); follow the foundation with the translucent powder applied with a fluffy brush or a puff. \n\nWhen applying the translucent powder, tap the smallest amount in the back of the lid and only use that. Any more than a dash of powder will ruin your look. A dash will be like half of a pea sized amount, maybe even a quarter. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "similar amount of redness to myself. ive used heavier and lighter foundations and concealers but mainly use concealer all over my face instead of using a real foundation and highlighting since i feel my paleness doesn't need the contrast of highlight or contour. a light sand color and cool tones countour if i feel like it but a sweet colored blush works as it's own sculpting tool without possibly muddiness. elf camo concealer i liked the lighest shade in rose i believe is the name, cool toned and lightly pink, neautralize with green color corrector if you want but the pink in the face we share doesn't really need that i feel, since it makes our face unrealistically neutral compared to how pink (at least my) body is. i currently very much love milk makeups lightest shade (i believe) in again the pink/cool undertone. i recommend both for different amount of coverage, elf much thicker full coverage and milk makeup much lighter/medium coverage. though those matches are both lovely, make sure you look for brands that keep your skin t y e in mind! oily, combo, dry, acne prone, etc are all factors and everyone has different results. you need a cool toned foundation/concealer to bring out your beautiful rosy toned skin!

            "As a professionally trained MUA, a couple of tips would help. \n\n\n1) These are all too yellow undertoned for you. They are very warm and your skin has a lot of cool/rosey pink in it. \n\n2) The lighting is not the greatest. The last picture the lighting is perfect (the one with your full face). You should test in that lighting. \n\n3) On some of the pictures, the colours arent spaced out enough on your neck/face to be able to tell. Too close together swatches just make it harder to tell. \n\nBut I suggest trying some neutral/rosey cool undertoned foundation. Based on your skin, Id say you are a neutral with cool undertone. You have some warmth, but a lot of rosey pink as well. \n\nHowever you have great skin, and Im a foundation hater as of lately and I feel most people dont need it ! Try using bb cream (if you want more coverage) but honestly just concealer is fine.",
            "Hot take: no foundation for you.\n\nYour skin is flawless. Get a BB or CC cream, or even just a clear primer (these options all provide a base to blend creams with and allow powders to stick to, without covering up your natural skin so much) You can still play with all the other makeup elements like blush, contour, concealer, etc like normal.\n\nIt\u2019s just not true that you have to cover up your whole face with heavy foundation in order to enjoy and utilize makeup. Why cover up your skin when your skin is this good?\n\nIf you do go for the foundation, apply it from your hand with a damp beauty blender with a super light touch.\n\nETA: also I just have to say if these are your eyebrows without makeup, holy cow you are blessed",

I'm 41 years old, so I chose products that help soften any fine lines, brighten the complexion, and look as natural as possible, etc.\n\nAllow me to offer some specific product suggestions:\n\n[Cool Toned Makeup Suggestions](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/22ODLOQV1AYXY?ref_=wl_share)\n\nThese are absolute winners, both in formula and shade for our coloring. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nSide Note: It looks like you actually have quite lovely skin. You don't have anything major you need to cover. \ud83d\udcaf So I'd recommend a light-to-medium coverage foundation. It will look more sheer, dewy and natural. I'd also recommend starting with a good facial primer to blur pores and set a smooth canvas for the foundation to rest on (it will also make it last longer). If you have oily skin, go for a blurring + mattifying primer. If you have normal or dry skin, go for a blurring + smoothing formula.\u00a0I've included an affordable \"do it all\" primer for you in my Amazon list link.\n\nHere's the written list of foundations (all included in link) that I think would look amazing and very natural on you:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f L'Oreal Paris True Match Nude Hyaluronic Tinted Serum Foundation with 1% Hyaluronic acid in \"Rosy Light\"\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Instant Perfector 4-In-1 Glow Makeup in \"Fair/Light Cool\"\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Age Perfect Radiant Serum Foundation in either \"Rose Ivory\" or \"Beige Rose\"\n\nIf you prefer trying a high quality natural looking matte powder foundation, I recommend:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f bareMinerals Barepro 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation (Full Coverage with Oil Control) in #25 \"Light Cool\"\n\nI noticed you have just a slight bit of yellow coloring under your eyes (perfectly normal), so I would recommend using a pink colored under-eye brighter followed by a cool toned medium coverage liquid formula concealer.\u00a0\n\nHere are my suggestions (I love these and they don't settle into fine lines or look too heavy):\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Multi-Use \"BRIGHTENER\" #160 (This is not a concealer but rather a sheer pink tinted brighter to combat any discoloration/darkness and open up the under eye area and get it ready for the concealer. You can also use it as a facial contour to highlight areas such as the cheekbones, narrow line of the nose, etc.)\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Multi-Use Concealer in either \"Cool Ivory\" (#095) or \"Fair\" (#110)\n\nAs with most makeup, start by using both the foundation and concealer you choose sparingly and only add more as needed until you reach your desired look. You want to keep your skin's appearance as natural as possible so the more sheer/light the application, the better. \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\n\nIt's also always a good idea to apply and/or check it in a source of natural sunlight (AKA in front of a window) to ensure it will look normal outdoors. Often bathroom or bedroom lighting will alter how you think it looks from how it actually looks once you're out of the house.\u00a0\n\nLastly, whatever you do, apply both the foundation and concealer using either a moist beauty sponge or a dense soft makeup brush designed for that purpose. It makes all the difference in the world to achieve a flawless final result! \ud83c\udfaf You can find cheap ones on Amazon that are really just as good as the expensive brands.\n\nI personally finish it all off with a light dusting of sheer green tinted finishing powder that helps reduce any overly pink coloring, eliminates shine, and holds your foundation in place (I use NYX Professional HD Finishing Powder in \"Mint Green.\") No worries, it doesn't leave any noticeable green color on you. Think of it like a last step hair toner that is just slightly adjusting the final result to appear more balanced.\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 PS: If you want, go on YouTube and search for videos about how to find/know your undertones. Undertones also apply to hair and clothing color choices to really highlight your beauty. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nChoosing makeup, hair, clothing, and even jewelry colors that compliment your cool undertones will make a HUGE impact on whether you look bright and beautiful or washed out and dull. The right colors/undertones can make your features POP and look amazing! Trust me. \ud83d\ude42\n\nFor instance, if you ever wear lipstick, blush or eyeshadow, you also want to pick cool undertones. Excellent lipstick shades on you would be lilacs, bluish cold pinks, mauves, plums, cool reds, cool nudes, etc. You can search online for suggestions of good cool toned blushes and eyeshadow palates to suit your tastes. \n\nWishing you the best of luck beautiful!

            "I also recommend the L'Or\u00e9al True Match Super Blendable Foundation. 1C is perfect for me, and I'm a little fairer than you. 2C should be a better match. L'Or\u00e9al has a color match quiz on their website, and you can see how the colors look on different models. You can also find swatches around on socials to help you decide. Not that I endorse Walmart or Amazon, but both retailers tend to have the cheapest prices on drugstore makeup. \n\n****************\n\nA few of my makeup recommendations:\n\nI do a bit of correcting before foundation or concealing. For redness, I have both the ELF and LA Girl green color correctors. Both are good. On a small palette, I mix a couple drops of green in with a half pump of my foundation. It shouldn't appear green, but more of a beige tone. I then use a damp sponge (with most of the water squeezed out) to apply the mix around my nose, chin, and any active acne. You can apply this in a thin layer all over, to cancel redness but try to avoid any area with enlarged pores.\n\nFor my dark circles, I use a concealer with a peachy tone (usually listed as a neutral tone), and I pat it over my darkness with my ring finger. That keeps the pigment concentrated where I need it. I then sponge the rest out towards my cheekbones and temples while avoiding the pores near my nose. My circles are very dark, so I splurge on concealer. My favorites are the Live Tinted, Fitglow, and It Bye Bye Under Eye. A more affordable option is either of the ELF camo concealers. I've also heard LA Girl is good, and NYX has some good complexion products, too.\n\nI tap a bit of concealer that matches my complexion over  some pigmentation and acne scaring that I have. I then go back to my little palette and mix my foundation with a little bit of the L'oreal Lumi Glotion. I use a damp sponge to apply this in a thin layer over my face, minus my under eyes, nose, and chin where I already have complexion makeup. I sponge the Glotion itself around my cheek bones and jawline.\n\nFor powders, a drugstore favorite is the Maybelline Fit Me. Most beauty creators I follow really like the Kosas pressed powder. Laura Mercier is the reigning queen of my modest powder collection. Any area of the face that is normal to dry, you don't always need to set those areas with powder unless you want a more matte or blurred appearance. Make sure you prep dry areas with a quality moisturizer before makeup. When you powder, use the lightest fluffy brush you can get, tap it into/onto your powder, and tap off excess. Using a light hand, gently dab powder where you need it. Sweep across these areas with a feather light touch.\n\nYou don't need to spend big money on eye products like eyeliner, mascara, or brow products. NYX is great all around. L'Or\u00e9al too. Essence is famous for its mascara. (I love their brow gel, only $4 and lasts forever.) You can also check out K-Beauty and J-Beauty retailers for some high-quality, affordable eye makeup. \n\nUsing thin layers of complexion products and the lightest powder technique you can manage is the best way to avoid \"cake face\" and emphasis on texture/lines/dry patches. A glycerin setting or finishing spray can help your makeup appear more seamless and pulled together. \n\nFor help choosing color cosmetics like blush, eyeshadow, or lipstick, you can find your \"color season\" with a quick internet search. Take a color quiz, and then you can look to Reddit, IG, and Pinterest for guidance on colors that complement your skin tone and natural appearance the most. Ultimately, go with your gut. If you want to wear purple lipstick, then do it. Makeup should always be fun.\n\nIf you're looking for help with makeup application, Nikki La Rose is my favorite YouTube creator for beginners' help and objective product recommendations. She has a big library of videos that can help you with anything you need.\n\n\nGood luck to you, and Go CATS!!\nSigned, a 37 year old in love with glitter eyeshadow",

Foundation basically makes you a blank canvas that you need to paint",

You don\u2019t really need it because you\u2019re natural skin looks nice. \n\nMaybe use a tinted moisturizer, and a little concealer on spots instead of a full coverage foundation. \n\nYou can also try just using primer, by itself.

I use a fluffy brush for light coverage (I\u2019ll mist the brush lightly with water first if I want to avoid looking too matte, and then spot conceal with a pointed foundation brush under my eyes and on any blemishes.) I\u2019m MAC NW20 (neutral cool). My neck is a lot lighter than my face and chest, more like NW15, so I either have to cover my neck carefully with NW20, or I use NW15 on my face and add color back in with a little bronzer. I have rosacea around on my nose and cheeks, so when I don\u2019t feel like color correcting (which is pretty much always), I use a more yellow foundation (NC15) on the center of my face in triangle shape, which reduces redness and functions as a bit of contouring. \n\nKnowing your MAC shade can help in matching for other brands, too, even if you\u2019re not a fan of their products. \n\nI don\u2019t have my makeup bag handy, but I think these are my shades in a few other options:\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear - ecru \nNeutrogena - natural ivory\nBare Minerals - fairly light\n\nYou can check out Findation.com to look for possible color matches. \n\nGood luck!",

I mean EXACT skin tone and issues, right down to the feeling like my skin tone is actually pink or red, but when I am calm it can be a tan after it burns some. I also have it where dak under eyes shows up really easy. Like I get red EASY but it is not rosacea. It's close to being ginger, I have red tint to my hair or undertone to it but it is NOT \"red\" or ginger it's like a dirty blonde but can be warm. I've been having trouble with foundation my entire life \ud83d\ude2c. I know I'm light but so the light ones make me look so pale and porcelain doll looking... Just fake looking. When I try a darker one that I swear blends in with my hands, it is straight orange or just not right on my face. Foundation can make me look almost grey or sickly looking. \n\nMy advice as well has been dealing with this for 42 years is this- first, don't sit right down and do your makeup directly out of the steaming got bath or shower. Let your skin calm down. Moisturize and let it calm again another 25 minutes. It makes a difference. You have pink undertone light skin and skincare will temporarily redden the face. \n\nUse products that are for cool undertones, or have a pink type of tone to them. One thing that really worked for me is I got this this from tatcha called the pearl , and it is an under eye treatment and brightener. It activated when you smear/break the product on the skin and it REALLY works. \nBut I take the tiniest amounts, and I dot them further down my face and blend/press in where I would want foundation to Even me out, and I'm telling you it gives the most beautiful finish and it improves the way your skin looks and feels . It says under eye brightening but it really works especially for the complexion type and color you have. It is a pink undertone, as it gets light but it is not just makeup if that makes sense. It also has a  humectant and it REALLY does retain moisture very well. There is no drying out or fading away. A jar of it has lasted over three years until I threw it out and bought a fresh one . Just my two cents. \nThe other things you might want to try is the Dr jarts tiger grass balm or cicapair . I hear a lot of people with red undertone love this and you have really good skin so you could use just that and look really good . \n\nAt the end of the day, bc the nature of having this type of complexion is that ANY skin is coverage product is going to seem unnatural for the following reasons- you have gone until 30 without really being into major AI you have been very used to seeing your face one way for a long time. Having red undertone like this makes it hard for face makeup because you are essentially covering everything and  have to add back in the color. When you are used to seeing so much pink and red from your natural skin tone it's hard to find a foundation that is comfortable.",

If you put the foundation there and it blends into your skin and you can't see it, it's the perfect match. So, when testing, you should be testing it on the neck. Secondly, if you can't find a perfect match. If you have a share that too light.  You can mix a little of a darker shade of foundation into it. Only do a little dark at times until you get the right color.  Note that some brands of foundation do not mix well together, especially if one is oil based and the other is water-based. Be careful of undertones. Some mixed together will become green. Also, you can use concealer to lighten a dark foundation.  Do not mix foundations in the original bottle. Only mix what you need either on the back of your hand or a surface like a plate or bowl. Especially if you don't know how they react together. I joke this helps some. I recommend that if you get a chance to hop into a makeup store.  Go to Ulta if you have one near you.  It's a good store for beginners and ask a staff member to help you find your shade match.

            "Hi! I\u2019m been doing makeup for over 20 years. I suggest you go into a cosmetics store or Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans etc and get matched properly. The formulas you sampled are all over the place , different coverage, different finish. Finish will be determined based off of your skin type , coverage will be based off your concerns. There is no one size fits all when it comes to foundation and concealer, it\u2019s very personal. Most people dont know their undertone, or their skin type . It\u2019s really best to see a pro that can help you out . Just go into whatever makeup / dept store and tell them what you said in your post . Be honest, tell them what your budget is, and ask them for their recommendations and to be color matched . Get sampled on it , and wear whatever they give you for at least a full day to determine what you like the most . Keep in mind not everything looks great with fingers, sponge , brushes. So if you don\u2019t have the right tools to apply it you might need to get that as well. And typically you will need to be color matched 2 times a year . (Winter color/ Summer color) I hope this helps! Good luck ! I hope you find your proper shade and formula.",

These are more sheer/buildable based on need (and more forgiving with mistakes!) and will help you establish a decent base for learning placements for products like contour/blush/highlight and proper application. As you feel more comfortable with your understanding of your colors and undertones, then start branching out and adding more products like a full coverage foundation.",

Since you own 3 and 4, you can always mix a little on a small dish, mix with q tip until you have a color that works, swatch with qtip to decide if you need to add a little more of lighter or darker...then apply with dotting on with qtip.

            "#2 fenty beauty cus Rihanna is life \ud83d\ude02. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the pictures but get a green tinted primer to control redness on your face but you say blue veins so you might need orange tinted concealer. Don\u2019t focus on foundation but go for concealer around the eyes (which would be a good base for eye shadows also). On your face I would go with a underpainting method for a low visual weight makeup. Primer, concealer, contour, foundation, bake, setting spray. You can invest in mixing pigment that you can add to foundation to help get your perfect match. I love LA girls pro color mixing pigment. Your skin tone changes with weather, stress, etc. so it\u2019s always smart to buy a foundation you\u2019re comfortable in and mixing pigment to lighten or darken it depending on your tone for that season. The cool thing about makeup is you can be artistic and fun and have so many ways to do it. Have fun!",
            "I love how helpful everyone is being \u2764\ufe0f \nYou already know that none of those foundations are it, I think. The samples are super thick though and not blended so it would be impossible to make a call from this picture. And lighting can change how skin looks. Natural light is best.\n\nI know it\u2019s inconvenient, but making a trip to an Ulta, Sephora, or actual make up counter will probably be your best bet to figure out at least a starting foundation that you can use in comparison to find alternatives on findation.com or matchmymakeup.com if you prefer cheaper alternatives. They\u2019ve done all the work of matching different foundations of almost every brand so that you can buy one knowing that it\u2019s at least close to your matched shade. And it will be waaaaaaaaaay cheaper than buying a bunch of foundations that don\u2019t work even if they\u2019re drugstore. Those add up quickly and you\u2019re left with a drawer full of product that take up space but you\u2019ll never use. I\u2019m a medium neutral who thought she was a light cool for way too long. \n\nI got into make up in my mid 30s as well. I\u2019m 47 now (and a tattoo artist so I get to play with all the fun colors and no one bats an eye). And honestly, I started a lot like you did. I have some favorite MUAs in YouTube to this day. I started by finding looks specifically for palettes that I owned or wanted so I wasn\u2019t trying find alternatives in colors when I was still super new to it. I have hooded eyes. I watched tutorials specifically for hooded eyes and now apply that every time I do make up. (Just a quick tip; you\u2019ll need to fudge your eye crease and make a new one right above your actual one. Use the darker shades just above the natural crease so you\u2019ll be able to see them when you look straight ahead with your eyes open. Any tutorial that says put a shade or this in your crease, you now know will actually go right above your crease if you have hooded eyes.) I figured out what my face shape was (oval) so I could learn the best way to contour. And over the years, I\u2019ve learned to adjust for my changing skin and features. The older I get, the more full coverage or matte coverage ages my skin. I\u2019ve gone from both to a medium buildable coverage with a more dewey finish. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to take an afternoon and just play with it. Lots of afternoons. It\u2019s trial and error and it\u2019s fun. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you can wash it off and start again. And pay attention to prep. Primers help the foundation go on smoothly\u2026. (Take note on if your foundation is a water or silicone based formula and get a primer that is also either water or silicone based). Prime your eyelids (I honestly just use a light NARS concealer) if you\u2019re looking to do bright colors. It helps the colors pop and helps keep the colors from muddying together.",
            "Late to the party. This might be a little out of your budget but hear me out... try IL MAKIAGE. yes its overpriced make up at 40$ but if you can't travel it is the best way to find a color match.

My face also gets pretty red which makes color matching against those areas harder. I used to use a green based primer, but it wasn't vital to making the foundation look decent. I'd be careful with color correction suggestions with the solid colors, it's easy to use too much or to get it in the surrounding area that doesn't need it and have it show through the foundation (may not be bright green, for example, but may create a greenish grey color under the foundation). Since you're new to makeup, a green primer would be great or even skipping it altogether.\n\nWith the right foundation, a lot of redness and eye discoloration will be covered already. Wait to pick up those products to see if you really need them. And keep in mind that lighting for videos on YouTube and tik tok greatly affect how makeup will look!! You will always have skin texture and visible pores, but on camera using powder over foundation helps make those areas look blurred and flawless. It can still look good in person, but don't expect to look the same as someone with a ringlight and a camera who may be color grading their videos, too!

            "Ooh I've been meaning to try this! Mac Studio Fix powder foundation is my HG! But I've heard the Fenty one is similar so I've been wanting to try it. What shade is this? I'm N4 in Mac which is a perfect match for me and probably 100 or 120 for Fenty but I've never worn a foundation of hers. The 100 looks super light tbh but everytime I think a foundation is gonna be too light it ends up too dark and then when I aim for lighter its too light on me. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nUnfortunately I think powder foundations in general aren't as popular these days. The trend rn is skin tints and light, dewy coverage. But Imo you can still get a dewy finish with powder foundation it just takes some skin prep! And I find it less fussy than liquid and easier to change the coverage level. I also like it better for touchups. Its my go to foundation for weddings and special events, especially in the summer!",
            "Great job on your pan \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe I always forget about this one. It\u2019s in a shade slightly darker than my skin, but not that it\u2019s summer and I\u2019ve gotten a tan it should work. Maybe I\u2019ll pull it out for a bit this week to try it out. I can appreciate a good powder foundation \ud83e\udd70",
            "##I know I'm late to the party but I just have to add my 2\u00a2. \n\nI am 56 years old and I've never mastered foundation. It just took too much energy to find the right shade, finish, undertone...forget it. I haven't even tried in decades, ***literally decades***. I just stuck to mascara, gloss, sometimes a little blush and liner and that was it. *Literally, that's all.*\n\nI've wanted to try a powder foundation for awhile because it's more my speed. Less to deal with. Just apply, buff out and go. A thin veil to blur my imperfections and, at most, a spritz of setting spray to make it more dewy and skin-like.\n\nWent to Sephora a few weeks ago determined to find my shade in Fenty's powder foundation (385) and I can't tell you how pleased I am. It's so finely milled that I can go from a super sheer natural look, or build for a more complete face beat.\n\nI haven't experienced any sensitivity or anything. I've also never mastered concealer so since I'm home all day **today, I decided to apply a bit extra under my eyes and buff out to see if it would also blur under my eyes**. ***Again, nailed it!*** No creasing, and it just looks like it evened out my undereye skin tone. Totally not the same as using concealer and banana powder or some other lighter powder to set, but still. It's quick and easy. \n\nI also don't have to use a bunch of different applicators or anything. I just spritzed again with some ELF Stay All Night setting spray and I basically look like I woke up like this. \n\n**Oh!** I also used a little extra on those nasolabial folds by the mouth and again, no creasing or anything. Just blurs it out. Even after talking, chewing, smiling. Beautiful!\n\n**So don't be afraid, ladies of a certain age.** While some powders can definitely make us look dryer and older, Fenty has killed it with this lovely powder foundation. I couldn't be happier. **Depending on the setting spray you choose to use, you can go from a lovely skin-like dewy finish or, for the oilier girls (like me in the hotter weather) you can use a regular or a more matte formulation for better oil blotting/shine control.**\n\n**Oh wait!! One more thing.** For those of you who might suffer **hot flashes** (like me) this powder holds up well to those **little beads of sweat around the forehead** that just pop up to embarass the hell out of us. Even when I blot at my temples, very little transfers onto my paper towel so I don't worry about having a line of demarcation between my hairline and forehead through the day. I don't even carry the pan with me throughout the day. No need for touchups. Just blot and go.",
            "It made me look oiler as someone with combo skin, but it didn't break me out. It also oxides very badly, but if you can stay more matte it looks nice."

You could also find maybe a soft pink or coral blush to be a buffer shade in between the contour & highlight. Also may i recommend trying a darker lip liner too (maybe a darker brown), you could even mix it with the one you have on in the photos, try using the darker on the outside & the lighter one closer to the inside. And a lipgloss that flatters the lipliner and gloss. Try to keep colors in the same color family for a cohesive look.",

I think the issue is that your makeup is too light, and is lacking depth of color. Which takes away the dimension of your features, making them appear flat and underwhelming. Get highlighter with more of a gold/light bronze shimmer and your features will POP as they should \ud83d\ude0d \n\nYou want the highlighter color close to your skin tone, maybe 1 shade lighter, with ample shimmer.

Or if you do stay with the same tone of highlight, i think a slightly lighter and more rust rather than berry toned blush and lipstick might be good to try if that makes sense! Last 2 things is I'd try taking a bit of time to just blend the \"seams\" where the highlight and blush and contour meet, and i think it might be popping to bring some of the highlight to the center line of your nose and just be sure to blend it with the contour. Grand scheme of things you can do no wrong cuz you're gorgina naturally! Those are just the things I'd try. Have fun with it! Also i love your outfit and hairstyle \ud83d\ude0d",

Incredible skin btw! :)\n\nETA: I will say I agree with others that you could maybe find a better shade for your skin as well, particularly around your nose. I\u2019m guessing you have blue undertones and you\u2019re wearing something that\u2019s more made for yellow undertones, cause your nose looks pretty yellow. Something that is more neutral may blend in better.\n\n(Or it\u2019s the opposite and you\u2019re not wearing much around your nose and you DO have yellow undertones. I\u2019m still learning lol please forgive me \ud83d\ude05 but yes like others have said, I think you could find a better shade for your skin tone)\n\nETA 2 (sorry lol): you have GORGEOUS lips, oh my goodness. So full and pretty. Although they kind of don\u2019t stand out enough to really showcase how pretty they are and somewhat blend into your skin. Have you tried a lip liner? I think you could use a very subtle lip liner to help differentiate your lips from the rest of your face without feeling too dramatic (unless thats what you want, in which case I would say purple lipstick or a very deep red or even a warm brown would look super cool on you!)",
            "I think a few false lower lashes at the bottom outer corner would really make everything pop! But I hate lashes myself haha",
            "I believe it's just too light under the eyes and the lightness goes to far into the cheek that it's throwing things off. It should definitely be lighter under the eyes but maybe make it a smaller area. I also think the eyelids themselves look too light and shiny, but that might just be a personal opinion. A sparkle would look nice but it being a flat shine kind of feels like it throws it off too. Everything else looks great though. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's too light of a color. I think it just might bee a little too shiny where it is lighter and either the rest of the face needs to look shiny or you might need to take some of the shine down a notch on the highlighted areas.",
            "Also there's a little bit of an orange hint in the face that's not in the rest of your body which kind of throws things off slightly but that part might not be too important. It could just be the lighting too.",

            "Beautiful!",
            "Makeup looks great just think you need less highlighter and more warmer tones. Blush probable added higher on your cheeks, and maybe a darker shade of lipstick/lipgloss or a brown toned lipstick/lipgloss. With this same look blush red/pink eyeshadow would look great. With the out fit I would recommend a blue line of eye shadow on the water line, kawaii styled blush on the cheeks and lip gloss without color.",
            "Brows too light and you need to take a brush and fill in your lash line with dark eyeshadow or pencil liner (area under top lashes). It will make lashes look more full. I\u2019d also apply a little more bottom mascara. You\u2019re beautiful.",

            "I would place a darker eyeshadow on your eyelid. A good method is to buy an eyeshadow with three similar colors. The darkest color goes inside the crease of your eyelid. The second darkest color goes on the actual eyelid, not in the place. The lightest shade is a highlight, and that goes above the eyelid to the top of your eyebrow.",
            "Right now your concealer/highlight is too light and the lines between that and the rest of your face are too harsh. Especially the upper cheekbones - it\u2019s like a harsh diagonal line right now. And your forehead has a circle of highlight in the middle/looks like the rest of it is contoured. Bring the nose tip highlight down as well. \n\nI would use a slightly darker shade to conceal/highlight and use a beauty blender to soften the lines between your contrasting colors. \n\nAll that being said - it doesn\u2019t look that bad!",

            "You look lovely!! As a makeup artist, I think that you could be getting some flashback with your powder as your skin seems a little ashy between your cheekbones and outer eye area. It could also be the concealer-highlighter combo so maybe play around with concealer placement and keep it tighter to your nose/inner corner and upwards but not outwards on your outer corner. If not that, maybe a slightly darker concealer or more of a warmer-toned highlighter. I\u2019d also suggest throwing a coat of mascara on after applying your lashes just to darken the underside of your lashes so that it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a gap.",

When I used to wear falsies that trick made all the difference. It makes them look beautifully blended and natural. I found pencil liner to be the easiest to use on the waterline.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re wearing any but if you are I can\u2019t really see it. Here\u2019s the order I would go in - contour foundation blush concealer powder.

I don\u2019t think highlighter is necessary for your find of face, there are no bony area casting shadows over anything, it\u2019s very open and all the light can shine on you unimpeded, if you see what I mean? I will say, though you didn\u2019t ask, you should not put eyeliner tilting out towards the side of your head from the corners like you do, it makes eyes look wider set, but you need no such mirage. You have a very natural beauty, and should maybe just use minimal makeup sparingly without the tricks others use to open up their faces or light up their faces because you simply don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s kind of no fun, and makeup is supposed to be fun, but it\u2019s also supposed to enhance your beauty, and yours needs little to no enhancement. If you want to play with lights and darks try bringing your eyeliner almost to the inner corner of your eyes (no outer wings!) and emphasize your brows above the inner corners too.

I think the makeup contrasts are what you think is off. I would recommend that you stop using that highlight below your eyes.

If this is the case, you can use a slightly darker face powder over \u200bit to better blend, or add a drop of foundation to the concealer to mildly darken prior to application. Otherwise, outside of this detail (which at first glance I wouldn't consider bad at all) I have always like the natural look. You've done very well to achieve that. If you wanted more Oomf in your current look, a more dramatic eyeliner (the cat eye wing line) and add a set of strip eyelashes that have longer hairs at the outer edge. If wanting more, a  well blended but darker lip liner would be a nice addition as well.",

I would recommend instead trying just one time keeping natural to your tone there and instead highlighting the bridge of your nose w/ no contour, dealer\u2019s choice on whether you apply reflective highlight there as well. That, and I can\u2019t see your cheek contour too well but it is placed well, maybe it continues a bit too far forward, I try to keep it to from right where the hair stops and ears start to about 1-2 inches down, pointing towards the corner of the lips. Follow the curve of your cheekbone if you can feel it, when I was learning to contour I would literally like rub my face to feel my bones. When blending that you sort of \u201ctrace\u201d that line and it ends up pretty well blended. Something I will say is that I prefer a liquid highlight but a set base and powder contour.

            "I'm so glad this is discussed. What I actually love about Fenty isn't *just* the shade range, it's their *range in tones*. Most of my Indian friends have a hard time finding foundations that suit them, because even if it's the right shade, it's the wrong tone. Until Fenty came out, I can't recommend a single foundation for darker skinned Indian women, who tend to have cool under tones....and I've been searching for 14 years, ever since I tried helping my friend with her makeup.\n\nMy makeup kit essential when I'm helping out my Indian friends with their makeup is blue & green pigment to colour correct their foundations. And this is a problem in Singapore, Indonesia, and even *India*. Giorgio Armani is the go-to foundation for my Northern Indian friends, because they finally found a shade that has the cool and olive undertones they have. My darker skinned Southern Indian friends have Fenty Beauty and that's it.\n\nHell, even I didn't realize for over a decade that the reason I thought foundation made me look so \"off\" for ages is because even though I could easily find a shade that matches me lightness-wise, I had the wrong undertones. I never realized I had yellow undertones until I discovered Korean BB Creams, and then I realized most non-Asian foundations only have pink/red undertones. Just looking at the shades of the MUFE foundation in that article and you'll see what I mean. Fenty was the first non-Asian brand that perfectly matched my skin tone & shade. \n\nSince Fenty did their thing, many brands like Maybelline & NYX followed suit and I'm so, so, so grateful for Fenty for starting the dialogue and proving that there IS a need. ",
            "It\u2019s interesting to see Mac\u2019s shade range laid out like that. I always thought it was much better than that. ",
            "I think what was revolutionary about Fenty was not the shade range but the fact that it put black beauty at the center of its mid-range and hugely popular brand. Rihanna\u2019s inspiration was her mom struggling to find a brand that called to her as a black woman.\n\nAnyway, the thing I love most about the article is how they laid it out. They took their time and it was nice seeing information this way without having to watch a video :) ",
            "I'm confused by some of these foundation choices. Like picking the Covergirl+Olay one, the range is like 6 total shades. Its terrible. Covergirl does have a much bigger range in their regular foundations, and a POC specific foundation line. ",
            "The desigb of this article is amazing. Love it.\nAlso, I'm really glad that this pointed out which brands are actually catering to dark POC and which ones are hyping up \"40 shades\" without actually being inclusive. Looking at you, MAC. ",
            "It's interesting that the sort of 'old fuddy duddy' brands that actually have proven great shade ranges according to this article still can't get any hype. Mostly I'm just mad they showed 'ashy' was an entirely accurate shading by Rihanna, lol. And I want to know about these secret night-dark drugstore foundations, but of course this experimenter's methodology seemed to be swatches taken from the brands' websites so idk.",
            "Yup, some brands have had wide shade ranges for a while. I think Rihanna's brand just had effective marketing and her built-in fanbase helped hype it up too. \n\nCeleb brands are powerful",
            "Wow, great article!!!!",
            "hmmm i love data",
            "This was a cool visualization but I wish they had compared brands like Nars (especially the newish Radiant Longwear line), CoverFX, and Becca under BIPOC-recommended brands with White founders. They're brands that have been about inclusivity for a minute now + they each have undertones in their darker shades that Fenty forgot about (though CFX needs to expand their olive range upward).",
            "Wow it\u2019s so nice to have it visualized like this!",
            "....Loreal? ",
            "It seems increasingly apparent that when people say \"catering\" to certain groups, that it's not just shades but also everything else a brand entails. It would never have occurred to me to check out what Estee Lauder or Lancome sell. Similarly, if you're at CVS and the Maybelline shade isn't stocked, who does that help? I'm of Indian-origin and was excited to hear about STELLAR, but they only sell it in a few stores and no way am I guessing my shade online, even if there is a greater likelihood that my \"one true shade\" exists with them. Finally, it seems like people want to participate in all the super-hyped YouTube brands (many of which aren't listed). Does it matter then if you can technically find your shade if you're also undergoing FOMO?"

            "It was the fenty foundation that made me realize i dont like matte foundations. And im kinda oily on dry skin it must be like the sahara. I actually prefer looking like an oil slick ",
            "I\u2019ve tried a lot of foundations in my life. The Fenty one was by far the worst foundation for my skin. I love that it works for so many people and the shade range is so incredible, but it made my skin look awful",
            "I wanted to love this foundation but it gave me lines that don\u2019t even exist on my face yet. If you are even the slightest bit dry, forget it. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "I love this foundation and I have dry to normal skin. It\u2019s fine, everybody\u2019s skin is different. I do think she used waaaaaay too much of it (and omg 10 times too much concealer, but I don\u2019t really wear concealer so I haven\u2019t tried it, maybe it\u2019s bad anyway). It was the same with RBK, she used like 4 pumps so it will 100% cake on your face, especially if you have dry skin. \nI use 1 and a half pump at most and I have a lot of redness to cover. It does have really good coverage so you don\u2019t really need more. I also use a moisturizing primer. \nNot every foundation is meant to work on every skin \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "I've been testing this foundation with a sample for the past week or so and I'm surprised that I really do like it. I have oily skin but still typically opt for a dewy, light coverage foundation. I have the It Cosmetics CC cream which I find to be so incredibly drying, cakey, and texture-enhancing, and the Fenty is nothing compared to that. It somehow gives me a dewy finish after the first 20 or so minutes once it mixes with my face oils. One blot a couple of hours later and I love the finish",
            "At first I kinda thought it looked so extra bad because the concealer was so light, which I find always highlights my redness and texture... But then it literally rolled off her skin. That was crazy. I remember the same thing happening when she used Sam's foundation in that vid where they swapped makeup bags. Really wild. ",
            "I really like the Fenty foundation, especially used with the Fenty primer (which is superb). It does go on super matte, however, within about two hours it has meshed with the natural oils of my skin to produce a more natural look. Also, I feel like this foundation is better with applied in thinner layers rather than caked on. ",
            "I want to see fenty\u2019s take on tinted moisturizer or B.B. cream. ",
            "I have oily skin and I don't love this foundation on its own, but I like it mixed in with other foundations.\n\nHowever, I know the foundation is meant to be worn in humid/hot climates and that is the literal opposite of Southwestern Ontario (where Allana and I both live) right now lol so I don't reach for it during the winter.\n\nI do think she used WAYYYYYY too much of the concealer and I personally don't use that type of concealer to cover acne since I don't think its effective for that purpose.\n\nEdited: grammar",
            "I'm also really happy that she mentioned wanting to pan certain products, like her highlighter and bronzer. I find her really relatable, using the same products over and over again, and I'm really impressed with the pan she has on the Lila b. bronzer! More content like this, please.",
            "It would be so cool if they made a satin/dewy version in the same shade range and then there really would be a foundation for everyone regardless of skin type or skin tone.",
            "Allana had an absolutely horrible experience with Fenty\u2019s foundation and concealer. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone with dry skin review this combo and it was a total nightmare. If anyone saw her Insta stories from a couple nights ago it literally gave her a rash all over her face. Skip to about 6:30 if you wanna get down to the nitty gritty. \n\nAlso, someone mentioned not too long ago that people are starting to not be afraid of giving Fenty (deservedly) negative reviews now, which I totally agree with. ",
            "I wanted to like the foundation and primer so badly but I just couldn\u2019t. Made my skin look like concrete. The foundation alone still made my face look textured. I love the glosses, flyliner, and highlighter though.",
            "I have the oiliest skin ever and I started straying from matte foundations. Sooo much less texture now ",

            "It\u2019s weird bc I have dry skin and if I moisturize well, I LOVE this foundation. If used with a damp sponge, I find that it\u2019s not too matte at all. \n\nTruly, the best use I get out of it is using it as a mixer! I mix it with the Nars Naturally Radiant Longwear foundation and it\u2019s my favorite combo of all time. I get the coverage from the Fenty and the finish from the Nars, it\u2019s perfect.\n\nSo for those of you that haven\u2019t had good experiences with it and still have it in your collections: maybe try mixing it with more radiant or glowy foundations!",
            "It\u2019s crazy how defensive people got with Fenty and would act booboo the fool when defending the complexion products while not applying that same defense to other brands. \u201cYou just have to prep more and use an oil and blah blah\u201d and walking around with just this dry, chalk-on-a -cement face. Like I love love Rihanna and I\u2019m hella thirsty for her to be back in music to replace the culture vulture demon baby Ariana, but she won\u2019t have me out here looking parched in the face. ",
            "I\u2019m very very oily but this foundation somehow made me so much more oily ",

( which tbh could have been me not matching my shade too well but I digress.) then two days after I tried it my face exploded into zit wonderland ( don\u2019t know if correlation=causation here). \n\nI really wanted to like it. So much wanted to like it.",
            "This foundation drives me crazy....one day it will look amazing, the next it will be the worst looking foundation I\u2019ve ever worn. \n\nI\u2019ve nearly used up the bottle trying to isolate what causes this (primer, application, dehydration?) and haven\u2019t found anything consistent.  I have other foundations that consistently look good, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this to myself, besides that I just what to understand why this happens",
            "I have combo to oily skin and the foundation separated on my t zone, nose, and chin. Great shade but it was too matte and drying for me. It was nice not having to touch up throughout the day but it just looked like a blotchy mess",
            "i was super bummed. it\u2019s so matte. i think i\u2019m going to put it away for summer. i like in the appalachian mountains and winter time is the worst. it\u2019s cold, dry and windy. i think it will work best in summer time when moisture returns! it is supposed to be humidity defying, so i will give it a fair shot. i\u2019m going to stick with my stila! ",
            "i've used my fair share of matte foundations, and you definately need to prep skin with extra moisture before using any matte labelled foundation (or any foundation tbh) but i dont even find the fenty one to be that matte. I always put it on with a beauty blender and then spray my sponge with setting spray and then dab it on top. \nI've found the only time fenty looks bad on me is when i've used to much in one go instead of layering",
            "My sister looks amaaaazing in the Fenty foundation, but on me it somehow changes color and makes all my pores stand out. I wish I can love it, but almost all high end foundations never look good on me. Milani from the drugstore has never failed me though. ",
            "For me, it was one of the worst foundations I've ever used.  It emphasizes every spot on your face that's even slightly dry. And at $40, I tried really hard to like it. Ended up giving it away to a cousin.",
            "Everybody acting like their opinion is gospel LOL. Everyone has different skin! My sister is kind of oily/combo and it looking fucking amazing on her. On me, some days it looks good and some days it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even have the full size, I have a deluxe size. I want to try mixing it with a face oil. ",
            "I wanted to like the foundation, but I hated it. I stupidly waited too long to return it and have been stuck with it for over a year, so I've been trying to use it up by using oil to sheer it out whenever I apply it. I feel like I'm never gonna finish.",
            "Fenty is one I've been meaning to try to get a sample of. I have pretty oily skin (no I'm not dehydrated) and they may have a match for me. I can't watch the vid atm, but my skin looks really, really close to hers. What's the shade she's using?..",
            "I think people now aren\u2019t afraid to give Fenty a bad review and idk if it\u2019s just me but do you get the vibe that Fenty isn\u2019t one of them brands that is going to get mad about a review? I feel like they love good and bad reviews i don\u2019t think you would get kicked off their PR list for giving a bad review like you would for some company\u2019s. ",
            "I LOVE the concealer and powder but I would never use the foundation. I\u2019m not watching the video but I hope she tries the concealer with her normal foundation to give it a fair try ",
            "Well, she's not wrong, it looked really bad on her but the methods she uses for her regular products also made it overkill here. I like the concealer very much and I have very mature skin but I use the tiniest amount of it. ",
            "I'm oily around my nose and  chin area, the rest is dry. I LOVE the way this fenty foundation looks on my skin. I used to use Estee Lauder Double Wear, but the color match wasn't nearly as great as Fenty. I use a really good moisturizer before putting this foundation on and then use Touch in Sol primer. I then mix a pump of my VDL primer with the foundation and apply it with a wet morphe blender sponge. The key to this foundation is putting it on quickly THEN press the foundation into your skin with sponge afterwards. That will melt the foundation closely to you skin and it will look natural and not cakey at all. When you press it in though, you need to press firmly. \u2764",

Also worried since most of my face is oily, the hydrating one will just fall right off? So curious to know others\u2019 experiences!"

How do the formulas compare? How do they look on your skin? \n\nThe smashbox hydrating studio finish foundation in 1.05 is my perfect foundation both shade wise and formula. It works for me so well that i can just slap it on parts of my face to spot conceal, blend it terribly, and it still somehow looks skin-like. I'm not expecting to ever find another foundation that can be applied as easily as that... but I am hopeful coz I now know it's possible lol! \n\nI loved it and super bummed it was discontinued shortly after I discovered it. I have tried the nars light reflecting foundation in gobi which is actually almost an even better match but unfortunately looks super dry and flakey on my skin no matter what skin prep or application method I do. Everytime I tried to apply it I felt like I was having a battle -.- \n ",

But the airspun loose face powder is built for that full coverage look and built to bake. I also have oily skin so my under eyes can handle the dryness that comes with baking, so I make sure that I use one that will not enhance textures and will not make those ugly crease lines. I also have super deep under eye creases so I know that nothing will ever stop it from creasing, I just don't want it to crease and look crusty. That's what that powder does for me.

The fact that Rihanna\u2019s racism is so easily dismissed (despite being brought up continually even within this sub) perpetuates the idea that racism against Asians doesn\u2019t matter. At least that\u2019s how I, as a Chinese-American person feel.",

            "That\u2019s a really good price point too, I\u2019ve seen a lot of skin tints priced the same as a full coverage and that seems like a rip off IMO. Edit: also the comments are saying there\u2019s a lack of light shades, I\u2019m not in that skin tone category but I want to know what people who are are thinking about this. Someone recently posted someone here who was complaining about a launch not being as inclusive of light shades but they got roasted, are people feeling that here too?",
            "I feel a little iffy about fenty right now. But I do hope releasing a skin tint with 25 shades does motivate other brands to start doing the same as her original foundation launch did. Too often I see people saying it\u2019s a skin tint/tinted moisturizer it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a good match when people point out a lack in any brands tinted moisturizer. Which is blatantly untrue and often excuses racist behaviors and allows brands to be excused and empowered to continue as such. Also skin tints/tinted moisturizers and complexion products in general  are not regulated by coverage so something called a tint could be like a medium coverage foundation. And even if it\u2019s not people don\u2019t want to wear something too light or too deep for them.",

        "text": "So I used to be really into makeup but I never fully understood the routine behind it. I eventually stopped doing full makeup looks altogether, just foundation & eyeliner have always been my go to. Now that I want to get back into skincare I\u2019ve found myself with a new issue. I\u2019ve always had very oily skin (especially in my tzone) & I cycled through many foundations & concealers, I watched what I ate & drank, I stuck with Cetaphil cleaning products, I had a friend who was far more versed in makeup application even give me lots of recommendations but my face is just naturally oily & the moment I stepped into the sun I\u2019d melt. \nHowever, about a year ago I moved to a different state & my skin has felt so much better. The air here is dryer & it\u2019s done more for me the past year than anything I\u2019ve ever tried before. It still gets oily outside (obviously), but it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I imagine this is what it feels like to have normal skin lol. While the Nyx Total Control Pro foundation I currently use has been an affordable worthwhile use, I was thinking if I should upgrade & go back to using Fenty? Fenty was the foundation that semi-helped my oil problem & it matched my skin tone so well. I\u2019m now wondering if going back to the Pro Filtr is worth it, or could it possibly dry out my skin with these new conditions? Is there some other foundation worth considering? Or should I just stick with my foundation & try a new concealer/primer? I just want to make sure I can keep my skin as fresh as it feels now, no extra oil production, no dryness I need to worry about. I\u2019m not sure if I need to start experimenting with different concealers & primers AGAIN. I don\u2019t have the extra money to do the most at the moment, I just want to start somewhere small but worthwhile. \nAlso does sunscreen add to the oiliness? I want to start incorporating that into my skincare but I really don\u2019t want to mess up how good my face feels now. ",

            "Good skin prep is the first step. I layer on toner, lotion, moisturiser and a sunscreen before any foundation and it makes everything sit better. All of my products are hydrating and moisturising since I have chronically dry skin with eczema every so often. \n\nI typically use a light layer and a damp sponge. I use a palette knife to \u201ccut\u201d the foundation (like Korean MUAs do), put it on where I need the most coverage (usually the centre of my cheeks and the top of my nose, between my brows) and blend using the damp sponge. It\u2019s a very finicky foundation and probably only really works on those with fully oily skin (like I\u2019ve heard Rihanna has) but with good skin prep and lighter application, you can make it work.",

        "text": "Please forgive me, this is my first Reddit post. \ud83d\ude2d But I thought it would help to share some swatches and give a mini-review of the Haus Labs foundation I picked up from the Sephora sale.\n\nFrom top to bottom:\nFenty Hydrating Foundation in 290\nCharlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Foundation in 7N\nHaus Labs in 190 Light Cool\n\nBonus+\nNars Radiant Creamy Concealer in Tiramisu\nHaus Labs Concealer in 21\n\nI've had that Fenty foundation for a few years old so its past its best date and may not be accurate to the matte foundation anymore.\n\nMy skin also runs dry all around. I consider myself a medium olive but I am very bad at judging my own skin depth as it changes dramatically based on the lighting. My inner forearm tone is closest to my face.\n\nThe Triclone foundation applies like a dream and almost requires no work to make it pretty. I found that it wears well with my skin prepped, over sunscreen and with or without primer.  There's a little scrunching on my nose corners after a long day, and that is normal. My skin goes back to being dry by the evening so more of my natural skin texture might show but I'm not gonna bother fighting god for that.\n\nThe finish is perfect, the experience wearing it really feels weightless. The second skin sensation is amazing! Its not too matte but also not dewy-ville. Haus Labs is basically my HG formula and I owe Lady Gaga an apology for assuming another celebrity brand would fail me.\n\nI haven't had it long enough to test it more conditions like high humidity - part of my reasoning for leaving the CT foundation behind was because its already dewy, and an hour in a steamy humid room left me, a natural corn husk, beaming like a lighthouse. I love a dewy face but oh LORD not like that. I also felt like CT color was not correct and made me much more reddish in photos than I realized.\n\nThe way Haus Labs labels their range is confusing, and I found my match in Sephora by slapping it on my cheeks and neck and loitering for an hour. My original pick was the next olive at 260 and it swatched very dark on me after loitering. 190 was the next olive down, and it looks more pale when dispensed. When I give it time to settle, or use setting powder, I suddenly have a  lovely match that doesn't look anything like the wet swatch. It takes longer without a setting power, but after 30 minutes it will look the same, just not as softly blurred.\n\nWhen I watched YT reviews, no one mentions that the foundation changing color. It looks relatively the same on everyone else from the pump to the face. If it's supposed to oxidize like Fenty, why hasn't anyone else mentioned this? Is my skin chemistry just accidently cooking its way into perfection? Am I just caught in the \"light\" categorization when I've considered myself medium-light at most? \ud83e\udee0\n\n-\n\ntl;dr haus labs has good formula for my dry skin and a big shade range. get samples before committing. it changes color from the pump on the skin for me and idk if it does that for everyone. trying a lighter color from haus labs may benefit.\n\nI haven't tried the concealer yet but its the color Haus Labs website recommended me for undereye coverage. In this case, I want that peachy tone!",

I typically lean toward medium to full in coverage with occasional tinted moisturiser use on days running errands. My skin is clear with occasional breakouts but I have big pores. \n\nI picked up this foundation on a jaunt to pick up some MILK products. I swatched shade 6 on my hand and immediately could see the blurring effect. I have quite big pores especially on my nose where I have scarring from blackheads. I shoved it in my basket.\n\nToday, I trialed wearing it to work in place of my medium to full foundation which can be anything from Too Faced original Born This Way, Double Wear or HUDA Stick Foundation. I used my Tatcha Liquid Silk Canvas primer as I wanted something the foundation could hang onto. I typically do a more glowy primer but didn\u2019t want to over do it. I did use CT Flawless Filter on the high points of my face for good measure. I powdered under my eyes where my concealer was and my t-zone. \n\nI wore a mask to work on public transport. \n\nIt was 88% humidity in Sydney this morning and the tram was HOT. \n\nThe finish is beautiful skin like and absolutely blurring. I have one scar on the tip of my nose that was completely blurred. I felt confident despite a small break out in this level of coverage which can be sheered out or built up. I felt super radiant and it held on through the day. \n\nI applied at 730am and by about 2pm there was some fading on the very edge of my nose but that\u2019s with wearing a face mask. By the end of my day which was 5:30pm my skin was still looking fresh with only small areas of fading which was discreet. My naturally oils were coming through but not massively. \n\nI am so blown away for someone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in the workplace without some significant coverage. I found it made my skin look fresh and flawless without looking overdone. I\u2019m not mad I impulse bought this AT ALL. \n\nHave you used it? What are your thoughts?",

This product IS cruelty-free, it is a vegan formula, has a 12-month PAO, & is made in Italy\n\n......\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fAPPLICATION STRUCTURE \n\n//\n\n+ APPLICATION METHOD: left 1/2 of face with a Real Techniques 'Expert Face Brush', right 1/2 of face with a Uv\u00e9 Beauty 'Pride Collection' makeup sponge \n\n+ RULES: no base primer, no powder, or setting spray - no other base makeup to affect wear; just the foundation & perhaps a slight bit of lip gloss on my very chapped lips \n\n+ OXIDIZATION: yes; this foundation oxidizes \n\n+ ACTIVITY POTENTIALLY AFFECTING WEAR: moderate house cleaning in the morning, worked outside in the humidity and subsequently sweat hardcore, refrained from unnecessarily touching my face at all times\n\n......\n\n\ud83c\udfc5CURRENT RATINGS ASSESSMENT: \n\n+ Sephora: 4.8 / 5.0 (1,441 ratings)\n+ Ulta: 4.8 / 5.0 (1,527 ratings)\n+ Fenty Beauty: 4.9 / 5.0 (48 ratings)\n+ Google: 4.2 / 5.0 (3,700 ratings)\n+ Kohl's: 4.2 / 5.0 (1,563 ratings)\n\n.............................\n\nTOTAL AVERAGE RATING: 4.6 / 5.0 \n\n......\n\n\u2b50 INITIAL APPLICATION: (1000) \u2022 very thin, liquidy consistency, needed more than anticipated. I squeezed the tint onto my palm, and dipped each tool in separately, then applied to my face. I preferred the overall look of the dampened sponge side - it looked very smooth and well-polished. The brush side also looked presentable and pretty. As I was blending, I did notice some 'resistance' which worries me regarding a dry-skin type. I achieved a 'medium' coverage level - it covered all associated redness, but I could still see through to some dark scarred areas, as well as to my melasma discoloration. I was successful in building this up. In the end, I got a very dewy, glowing finish. I wouldn't say that this formula necessarily needs a setting powder to finalize it, as it feels self-setting with a complete dry-down after some time.\u00a0 \n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd51 2-HOUR MARK: (1200) \u2022 [still wearable]; still looking extremely dewy and fresh. Looks exactly the same as application\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd54 5-HOUR MARK: (1500) \u2022 [still wearable]; still looking exactly as fresh as application. There is absolutely no break-up, no settling, and no wear. I am quite a bit shinier than I care to be, but that's no problem\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd57 8-HOUR MARK: (1800) \u2022 [still wearable]; still looking astonishingly fresh, cannot find any visible signs of wear, 45-minutes ago I was severely sweating (dripping down my face) and this foundation was not the least bit affected \n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd5b 12-HOUR MARK: (2200) \u2022 [still wearable]; I really can't believe how good this still looks! I cannot see any place on my face where it looks 'worn', it looks as fresh as application \n\n......\n\n+ \ud83e\udd13 OVERALL REVIEW: \n\n//\n\n+ TRUE COVERAGE: medium, buildable\n\n-\n\n+ TRUE FINISH: very dewy, glowing / self-setting (no setting powder necessary) \n\n-\n\n+ OXIDIZATION: yes; this does oxidize - however, consider this shade range IS flexible, so the oxidation level shouldn't really have a large scale affect on your overall shade option\n\n-\n\n+ MELASMA TEST: fail; was able to see through to all of my melasma discoloration \n\n-\n\n+ PACKAGING: this geometric packing is really neat, and I think the entire thing is quite unique itself.\n\n-\n\n+ RESULTS TO CLAIMS: lightweight = pass | buildable = pass | light-to-medium coverage = pass | blurs and smooths skin = pass | long-wear = pass | natural finish = fail |\n\n-\n\n+ VALUE: Using the 'average' amount of foundation as 1.0 fl oz., this particular bottle contains 1.08 fl oz, which is SLIGHTLY above the average amount. This calculates to be $29.63/ounce, which I would consider mid-end pricing:\n\n\u2666\ufe0f PRICE PER 1.0 FL OZ SCALE:\n\n<$10=low-end; $11-$31=mid-end;\u00a0 $32-$60= high-end; >$61=luxury\n\n......\n\n+ RECOMMENDATION: can I just say...WOW! This foundation formula completely shocked me! I was hoping it was gonna be good, but this beyond-impressed me. It's been a LONG while since I've tried a foundation-type product that was this good. I'm SO SUPER excited to continue wearing this!\n\n//\n\nRECOMMENDED APPLICATION TYPE: dampened sponge \n\nRECOMMENDED MAX WEAR TIME: 12+ hrs\n\nRECOMMENDED SKIN TYPE: normal, combo, oily | (dry skin = use HEAVY moisturizer prior)\n\nPRIMER RECOMMENDATION: possibly a mattifier \n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udea6RATING: A\n\n......\n\n\u2b50 RATING LEGEND:\n\n+ A = on par with my benchmark products\n+ B = I like it just fine, but has some flaws\n+ C = personal bias, nothing wrong w/ product\n+ D = this didn't work out for me\n+ F = I totally hate this\n\n......",

            "I swatched the lightest available shades for each. There might be lighter ones online that my Sephora doesn't stock. I also swatched two bonus ones because they were there and looked promising. \n\n- Too Faced Born this Way foundation in *Snow*. Requested was Cloud, they don't have Cloud, Snow was the lightest. I've previously owned Cloud and it turned orange like this too.\n- KVD tattoo foundation in *L42N, L41* as per request\n- Fenty Pro Filt'r in *100*\n- Hourglass Vanish Stick in *Blanc*\n\nPictures in order\n- First taken inside Sephora, shades NOT DRY. For labeling purposes only\n- Inside Sephora, brightly lit, mostly dry\n- Outside in natural light. 10am and rainy/overcast\n\nI will try to tag the user who requested, but idk how that works, so wish me luck.\nAdditional notes: Both the Fenty and the KVD L41 turn pinker during the day. These swatches are dry, but they are just a few minutes old. They do not oxidise MUCH darker or orange on me. I usually wear L41, it is my skin but pinker when fully dried after an hour of wear. \n\nFenty is a SMIDGE darker than KVD 41. The camera doesn't pick that up fully. However, they are close-ish?  Hourglass looks very similar to L42 but I don't own these and can't tell how they wear. Too Faced is a mess considering that's the LIGHTEST, but all their stuff turns orange like this.",

        "text": "I went to Sephora a couple of months ago to find out that my absolute above all HG foundation had been discontinued. I seriously can't stop being frustrated about this because it was literally the ONLY foundation that made my skin look so radiant without even having to use primer or anything else with it, really (for days where I don't care if my makeup mostly melts off my face, bc it just melted IN and still looked p good). It also NEVER breaks me out even when I forget to wash my face at night! I still have the ONE I bought maybe 2 years ago, and it still works perfectly lovely but I know that that probably won't last for long. \n\n  \nDoes anyone have ANY IDEA why they discontinued it? I need some closure cuz I honestly believe that since it worked so well by itself, people weren't buying as much primer or w/e else as much. If I use the Soft Matte I am FORCED to use more products on my face that I could just skip out on when using the Hydrating formula. \n\nAlso, if anyone happens to have any reccs for any foundations I could try that might be close enough, please share! I really don't trust Sephora to point me in the right direction when it comes to finding my perfect match (have been burned way too many times, also their store lighting always has me choosing an off shade which is also very annoying lol). It's starting to kind of depress me when I try looking and am always disappointed. It just really sucks looking in the mirror and expecting a \\~work of art\\~ but I just look patchy and crappy, and that is WITH me doing the extra steps to make it sit better.\n\nSorry this was kind of ranty! I just wish this foundation was still available. Sad I can't repurchase it and that I didn't at least buy a couple more ahead of time/when they went on sale.",

            "I honestly believe it just didn't sell well. I always saw people online raving about the soft matte foundation but not the hydrating one. \n\nPlus the eaze drop skin tint seems to be their replacement for it, but it's still a different product. Not really a radiant finish, more soft satin/matte. Maybe you could try it?",
            "The Fenty Hydrating foundation was my go to until I started using Lisa Eldridge.  I\u2019d recommend it if it\u2019s in your budget.  They are both long wearing (which is what directed me to the Fenty in the first place) and have extended shade selection.",
            "I was in the exact same boat. I even stopped wearing foundation altogether because I simply could not find one that was as good!!! But I ended up sampling and buying the Shiseido radiant foundation (I think it\u2019s called something along those lines), and it\u2019s amazing. Honestly I think I like it better than Fenty!",
            "SERIOUSLY? I had no idea they discontinued it. This is literally my holy grail. The perfect shade match and formula for me. I hated the Eaze Drops. Definitely going to be following this thread.",
            "Fenty Hydrating was my HG too. I have been using Urban Decay Hydromaniac. It'd very comparable. I might like the UD more, tbh.\n\nETA: I have tried the Shiseido mentioned in another comment. It is also *very* good.",

            "I did not find that the foundation was hydrating. It looked almost matte on my skin. Glad I bought it only on sale. \n\nReal hydrating foundations I like are the Givenchy prisme libre skin caring glow foundation or the revlon illuminance foundation.",
            "Unfortunately I've never tried the hydrating foundation, I wanted to :( \n\nBut maybe you could try the **IT cosmetics CC cream**, they have a couple different finishes, I have the Nude Glow one. It's got a really nice finish, but I find their colors pull too pink on me, I'm very yellow/golden. One I like even more than IT is the **No. 7 Protect & Perfect foundation**, it's very similar to the IT one but 1/2 the price! No. 8 runs more golden I think, but they don't have a lot of shades. Both foundations are medium coverage, so if you want high coverage they probably won't fit the bill.",

            "The eye makeup is absolutely stunning!\n\nI would say less highlighter on the nose as it's drawing too much attention away from your eyes. Have you got a sunburnt nose? The bridge looks like a sunglasses mark, and the rest of the nose is then darker than your face. Would try to even this out where possible. \n\nA little more blush and a richer/pinkier lipstick would also help.",
            "You look absolutely stunning. The only thing I might suggest is a more pink lip color. I feel like this one is washing you out just a tad. Please give us an update when you have a final look, because I know it will be great!",
            "Less highlighter on the nose bring the contour color on the eyes a bit farther in. Pretty though",
            "Lashes are absolutely beautiful and so is the eye makeup, really brings out your eye color! It looks like a little bit of foundation wiped off the bridge of your nose just slightly, so I\u2019d keep something to reapply as needed (: \n\nAnd congrats on getting married!",
            "Love it, I would just lighten the eyebrows. Throw some iridescent/white on your waterline instead of black to open your eyes more. And more of rose blush on your cheeks rather than bronzer.",
            "Don\u2019t do the highlight on tip of nose \u2014 it won\u2019t photograph well.  Add more blush and a lip with slightly more color to it. Also, your brows aren\u2019t quite even \u2014 your left brow needs to come in just a tiny bit more, it looks like. I really like the shadow and the rest of your base makeup.  Congratulations, and hope your special day goes well!",
            "I would say everything looks pretty solid! If anything, I would deepen the eyes a bit and blend out the contour on the cheeks a little more + some blush! Love the eye look!",
            "So beautiful! I love the eyes!\n\nMy two points would be about the placement of the brown on the outer corner of the eyes. It seems a little low or like some has transferred under the liner/outer lashes to the lower corners of the eyes. I would try and keep the shading above/inline with the upper lashes to really accentuate the lift of the eyes/the lashes! Also, not that my opinion matters on this but I LOVE the big lash on you! They\u2019re stunning.\n\nHere is the region I\u2019m talking about in case I\u2019m being awful at describing it!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gdup6rhflxob1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aa4d9b85b8cf2a1c8a34ef7b888163c58272c00\n\nYour base looks glowy and fresh! I\u2019d just recommend adding more blush since it often gets washed away in photos!\n\nOverall you look gorgeous and congratulations!",
            "Way too much highlighter on your nose other than that it looks good.",
            "Looks nice! I\u2019d try a lip color that contrasts more with your skin color. Something brighter or darker.",
            "Love the eyes! More blush, less highlighter on the nose, pinker lip/less nude of a lip! Also I see a good amount of contour on the nose so I would do the same amount of contour on the face if you\u2019re doing the nose (maybe more on cheeks?) :)",
            "So pretty! I\u2019d add a little more blush so you have more of a flush in group pictures, especially since you are probably wearing a white/light dress (and not blue like that shirt that is such a fabulous color on you). To nitpick I\u2019d also make sure to blend your bronzer or contour all of the way into your hairline as it looks like you have a tiny bit of a gap there right now. Someone suggested a brighter lip and I agree, but I would switch to this combo for the reception since it will be more forgiving and wearable as you\u2019re kissing, eating, drinking, etc. If you are having a photographer there while you\u2019re getting ready I would ask them to take a few shots of you before you set and make sure you\u2019re photographing well. Sometimes certain products will have the flash bounce off of them or don\u2019t look as smooth or saturated on camera. I used to do a ton of weddings and this was always a ritual because it meant better photos/less editing.",
            "I would skip the nose highlight personally. It's a trend that will look outdated in a few years, I would go for a more classic look.",
            "Gotta go heavy with the makeup so it lasts and shows up in pictures.",
            "Looks great! I agree with less highlighter on your nose but also try to fade your brows out towards the center so there isn't such a harsh line. The inner edges are also a little too \"rounded\" but I think that won't be a problem if you just fade it out towards the middle. \n\nThis is just a personal preference, but the black eyeliner on your lower lid is making your eyes look more closed off. I would try only lining the outer half of your lower eyelid and using a thinner stroke. But your eyeliner is very well done and if that's the look you prefer, there's nothing wrong with it. Just personal preference like I said",
            "I love the look but the tip your nose has too much highlighter on it. It will show up in photos looking like the tin man from the Wizard of Oz.",
            "Honestly, this makeup is gorgeous. If you like it, I can't think of anything I'd suggest you change.",
            "Just to be nitpicking as you\u2019ll want everything perfect on the day. I think your brows are filled in slightly unevenly with the right (or your left) brow being a bit darker. And your eyeliner could be a little more crisp. \n\nI also think a different lip colour, something a bit more intense.\n\nYou look amazing though!!",
            "Beautiful job. I would tone down the nose highlighter-this is \u201ctrendy\u201d and timeless is wise for a wedding.",
            "I can\u2019t help but mention the super shiny highlighter nose is very cute and very fashionable at the moment but it\u2019s generally advised to avoid trending styles for a wedding as it\u2019ll look super dated in a few years when trends cycle again",
            "The eyeshadow beneath the eyeliner wing makes it look like u have dark circles, otherwise it looks perfect!",
            "The highlighter application on the nose will look dated when you look back at photos later, imo. But you can decide if that bothers you or not. Some people want their photos to be very of the moment and some prefer more classic. \n\nI\u2019d add some blush and a pinker lip (still natural since that\u2019s your vibe but a diff tone). \n\nThe brows seem a bit too heavily filled and the shaping is a touch blocky but can be easily solved with some blending and practice.",

            "Looks so pretty!!! Which colors from the in bloom palette did you use??",
            "Not here to give make up tips as the others have covered that. What I would say the most important thing is that you like it and feel like the best version of you for pics you will be looking at for many years. Does your partner look at these pics and say you look beautiful (which you do of course). Make sure you have checked that anything you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t cause any flash back and just enjoy your day it goes by so quickly \ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "It looks so gorgeous on you! Literally compliments your beautiful eyes! I\u2019d recommend a rosy blush and maybe a dewier base but i know people like a full coverage matte base for their weddings so you can skip that!",
            "Blush & more pigmented lip color. It all looks so pretty, I don't see anything to change, just add to your lips & cheeks (blushing bride). Congrats! I also had an October wedding",

            "Blush!!!",
            "You look beautiful!! I\u2019d say a little less highlighter at the tip of your nose (just a little) and try adding a little more color to your cheeks. Try adding a little more than you think as it\u2019ll come off over time and also with photos it takes more for it to come through. But eyes are S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G. Brows on point. You\u2019ve got this girl!",
            "Less highlight on the end of the nose. More of a pop of color on the lips. A bit more blush or a deeper shade of blush up higher on the cheeks.",
            "It's really good, but if I *had* to criticize, I'd: \n- Tone down the nose, looks too red and shimmery, specially if we compare it to the rest of the face\n- I think both lashes are way too disproportionate, very long in the outer corners but very small in the center (I like when the ends are larger, but I think this ones are too much, looks like you've only got lashes on the corners) \n- I'd have a more polished brow look, they look good for everyday but I prefer them neater for a bridal look. \n\nHappy marriage!",
            "More blush, higher up on the cheeks.\n\nAlso less blushnon the nose.\n\nA warmer lip colour.\n\nOtherwise looks great! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",

            "First of all, you look absolutely beautiful!!! I love the complexion and the eyes SO much! I would add a bit of highlighter to your inner corner to brighten your eyes just a tad more. Also I think like some others have said, a tad deeper in the lips. I\u2019d really recommend makeupbymario pink nude lip kit with the liner and lipstick, it\u2019s a similar tone to what you have now but a little bit darker. Congrats on your wedding, you\u2019re gonna be a total stunner!",

            "Beautiful! Maybe add a touch of blush. Take some flash photos and make sure you like how it looks in photos.",
            "I love love everything about this, but I'd suggest to pick another color for the lips. This one is washing you out and mayhaps wont be visible in photos. Maybe something pinker, or dusty rose? I think I saw a great color by muzigae mansion that might look fabulous, but I forgot the name.",
            "You did an awesome job. You look great!",
            "Lovely",
            "Super pretty ! Maybe try to fluff your brows in a upward motion , almost like a brow lamination effect, I think would help the look, or if you feel confident and have time incase you decide it\u2019s not for you, get one done and see if they will do a brow tint!",
            "the eyes are stunning",
            "The only thing I\u2019d suggest would be a bit more colour on your cheeks and lips. A light pink would look absolutely great",
            "Woah you\u2019re so stunning! Like others said, the lashes and eyeliner could be neater, but overall, you did a great job on the eye look. I also would add more blush, plus some more foundation on the nose. One last thing is that although the lip color looks great on you, I think it would be better if you had a slightly darker lip liner. \n\nOverall, you did such a good job!!! I wouldn\u2019t advise most people to do their wedding makeup, but you did really well",
            "You have a beautiful face. Congratulations on your wedding.",
            "Get your eyebrows microbladed to accentuate the look. Maybe get a professional make up artist or study one. Find a base like a panstick that has better coverage. You could use more of a matte eye shadow with a liner on the eyelid at lash level. More coverage on the nose and a soft face powder and soft blush. Pick a matte lipstick and lip liner with more color.",
            "Advice is pack on the makeup a bit heavier than normal. It will be a long day from start to finish. I normally hate heavy makeup but I\u2019m happy that my friend did mine heavier for it because I was still missing spots by the nights end so if I did it my way I probably wouldn\u2019t have had any left. For the bride you probably get like one touch up after pictures and like 1-2 quick pee breaks all night since everyone wants/ needs your attention. Add blush definitely, and either a darker brown or brighter pink lip definitely. Oh and I also am on the longer lash train. I think it will photograph really well but whatever you are most comfortable with. And a little bit of white or that light color you\u2019re using in the eye corners and under the brow bone would look nice.",
            "You look like a doppelganger of this girl I know named Candace. It's freaking me out.\n\nYour make up looks lovely, honestly. I'm just really stuck on the Candace thing",
            "Everything looks great, i think maybe practice cleaning up the brown eyeshadow to shape it better? Eyes closed it looks perfect but when you open your eyes, it droops a little bit",
            "Absolutely gorgeous! I envy your blending skills, I still struggle! \n\nMy only suggestion would be to soften the brows just a little. Maybe a slightly lighter color or just a lighter hand.\n\nHappy wedding!",

Hope that makes sense! (Would also love to see a bit of a pinkier blush to match the new lippie)",
            "No advice, but you look so pretty!!",
            "I absolutely love it! Just a comment though,  have you tried the MAC face and body foundation long wear and sweaty wear? It's one of my favorites but it never gets through a long wear past 5ish hours for me. Not sure how long your wedding will be and what but I recommend trying it for the length of time you will wear it for.",

I also noticed the inner edge of the longer lash wasn\u2019t laid down all the way, which can also contribute to the illusion of a boxy or downturned eye shape. Make sure the inner corner is well adhered then try gently curling the lashes after the glue is completely dry. You could also use a little more mascara in the center!",

            "This overall looks great. I like the emphasis on eyes and the more natural lip. Maybe a bit less attention on the nose though, more subtly- it is overemphasized here and the tip highlight is distracting rather than flattering.",
            "You are very talented! You look beautiful!",
            "gorgeous ! as others have mentioned a think a more contrasting lip would tie it all together",
            "Everything is perfect and you look absolutely gorgeous but I do think the blending on the eyes by the outer corner went a little low and started to blend into the under eye a bit! Maybe do your eyes before your base so your blending doesn\u2019t travel!",
            "First of all you are beautiful! The only thing I would change is a teeny tiny bit more blush and a more \u201elively\u201c lipstick shade, something like a coral nude shade or a pink nude shade. You must keep in mind that flash photography can sometimes wash you out a little bit, I think the lipstick shade you chose might give off concealer lip vibes in flash photography.",

            "Gorge! But I would add more highlight to your cheekbones as well as a pop on the inner corner of your eyes. I would also consider a little more *something* on the lips. Maybe a muted/blotted wine color since it\u2019s a fall wedding.",
            "I\u2019m not sure which products went on your nose, but it looks darker than the rest of your face. Maybe it needs less bronzer/ a touch of concealer down the middle? I\u2019d also love to see a rosy color on your lips. Overall you look a tad washed out.",
            "Darker lips and some blush",
            "Your nose looks more pink/red than the rest of your face, is it always like that? Is that why you use an anti-redness primer?",

            "I think you look beautiful, but I think you might just need a little stronger/brighter color. This look seems a bit soft for your coloring, and pictures. However, if that's what you're going for, it's very pretty.\n\nETA: eyes look perfect. I think just stronger lip and blush color.",
            "Agree with others saying to add some lip color! Your eyes look so good!",

            "I would take the red away from your noes. Not sure if the redness is intentional but it makes you look a tad sick. Like you have a stuffy nose (my sister had this at my wedding and her noes was red in all the pics). I agree with other regarding color for blush and lips. Eyes are awesome!!",
            "Whoa, you look so cute. You rocked the *hell* out of that eye look! It\u2019s really flattering. My two suggestions would be to change your lip color to something brighter, think more pink/coral tones (and I\u2019d even use the same product as a blush to bring some color back into your cheeks). The other thing I\u2019d suggest would be to change your set of lashes to something that won\u2019t drag your eyes down. You\u2019ve got beautiful eyes, a wispier lash will let them shine!",
            "The whole look is stunning! I just think a slightly darker lipstick would wash you out less! I think bolder photographs better also, not to say you can\u2019t keep it in the nude realm! Or if you don\u2019t want the darker lipstick, maybe a darker lipliner",

            "Pretty!  Love the eyes. \n\nIf you\u2019re wearing white, I think you should practice with a white t shirt on. Wearing white or a shade of white is a whole different effect than wearing blue. You might discover you need to adjust blush or lip or not and keep it all the same. \n\nEnjoy the day!",
            "You\u2019re so cute!!! You could wear no makeup and your eyes would light up the room!!!",
            "Very cute look and you have amazing skin.\n\nThe highlighter on the tip of the nose -trend should stop already! It's gonna look silly in a few years ( well it already does) and this is the moment you're gonna remember for the rest of your life. Wedding photos should be quite timeless and avoid some obvious trends.",

You can\u2019t be sure of the lighting and I would hate for you to end up with a beautiful portfolio except your nose photographs a much different color and level of shine than the rest of your complexion\u2026 I agree with others about brightening your lip color.",

            "I saw in a comment you\u2019re still practicing getting a technique down for setting lashes. That was going to be my only big note honestly, i like the whole look\n\nPutting the glue on the lashes, with a dry-clear liquid one using a brush not a stick/pen, and putting an even layer on the band, waiting for it to get a little tacky, and then placing based on the middle part has helped me.\n\nI place it on the middle of my eyelid (trim beforehand), then press the edges down after. For me i hold them down with light pressure on the middle and corners for a bit to let it fully set",

            "I personally think you did a great job. If I had to give you a grade, I would give you a B+.  A foundation would tone down the redness in your nose.  I would maybe lighten the eyebrows a tiny bit. Maybe add a LITTLE bit more blush but not much more. I would thin the inner corners of your eyebrows a little bit but you have great eyebrows. Most women would pay for yours. A rosy/mauve lipstick/gloss would look great on you. I also have fair skin. Hope your wedding goes well. Congratulations!!!",
