And, I did not use a lot at all.  The brush is the way to go.  BTW, I used the little sponge applicator to tap on my concealer powder to set.  That also did an excellent job, so don&#39;t toss it --- reuse it!! Thanks for another great video.  Say, could we see you do some makeup on older glamor girls like Gabbi does??

            "Your seal of approval on a foundation is so important so I really appreciated this video. I wore Tir Tir for the first time today. I‚Äôm 78 with dry-combo skin in summer and since I‚Äôve been using Retin A for years, my skin is minimally wrinkled but I have labial and marionette lines around my mouth which foundations love to settle in. The TirTir looked a little makeupy on my forehead, but natural overall. It didn‚Äôt settle into lines or wrinkles. It‚Äôs tricky to apply though. If you press down enough to get product on the pad, it‚Äôs way too much to apply directly to skin. Rubbing the pad on the inside lid and then applying to face will still result in too heavy a coat. I learned to just pick up just the tiniest bit on the pad, then rub on the lid, then press the whole pad on the lid and then apply. I also tried using a damp sponge which I patted on the product left in the lid. Both those techniques gave me a more natural finish. It did last all day but got pretty glowy. I powdered lightly after 5 hours and it looked great. Unfortunately I got 27N and it‚Äôs a tad too dark &amp; yellow for my skin tone so I ordered the sample kit from Amazon for less than $2 so I can try some different colors before I order again.",

            "Tirtir actually has SIX or SEVEN different types in their cushion line and the silver snd pink arent new, they&#39;ve been around for about a year already. What&#39;s new is the shade range expansion. Would love for research beforehand so the video doesnt give misinformation thanks!",
            "Does anyone know if the new foundations will be available on Amazon Canada??",
            "Might try the silver one since im dry. I didnt like the red one; gave it to my sister who&#39;s oily.",

            "I will never understand perfume in foundation or face creams.",
            "If I wear a sunscreen everyday, and the e sunscreen leaves my skin looking‚Ä¶shiny/dewy already, would you recommend the original TirTir satin finish still, or the matte one?",
            "Tati, will they be selling their sponges so that you can change them out and be able to try to clean them and not keep using the same sponge over and over again",
            "Tati, have you found that the Vitamin C has an odd scent once it‚Äôs been sitting on the skin for awhile? It‚Äôs not a perfume or added fragrance, just really weird. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. You‚Äôre absolutely correct to the quality of their skincare though. I love the cleansing balm and enzyme cleanser, along with their Niacinamide with Retinol Serum. The milky toner is a bit heavy for me, but the light version is wonderful!",
            "How do we get the correct shade without having to purchase them all to test???",
            "I use the red one. I like it, but it transfers a lot.",
            "I have no idea why I&#39;ve been resisting the cushions because I LOVE their skincare line. I think the shade match was freaking me out. Got the red cushion mini and nailed the color on the first try. OMG. I don&#39;t know what kind of magic is in this stuff, but it&#39;s amazing. It stays all day without a primer or spray. I don&#39;t want to claw my skin off at the end of the day. It doesn&#39;t settle into pores or lines (I&#39;m in my 50s with drier skin). And I want to buy a million of the minis for my purse. I also think I can get away with the mini in my purse on a plane without having to put it in my liquids bag, which is a huge bonus for me. The fact that it&#39;s $15-$25 depending on size is a huge bonus. I have a graveyard of foundation bottles that I can now get rid of for good. If you&#39;ve been on the fence like me, just try it. So good.",
