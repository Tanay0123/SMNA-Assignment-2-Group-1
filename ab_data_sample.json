I don&#39;t know how this happened to a nice girl like me!!), and have what they say is good skin.  However, I can&#39;t believe how beautifully this foundation went down on my face!!  GORGEOUS!! And, I did not use a lot at all.  The brush is the way to go.  BTW, I used the little sponge applicator to tap on my concealer powder to set.  That also did an excellent job, so don&#39;t toss it --- reuse it!! Thanks for another great video.  Say, could we see you do some makeup on older glamor girls like Gabbi does?? I loved all the Creator videos.",

            "Your seal of approval on a foundation is so important so I really appreciated this video. I wore Tir Tir for the first time today. I’m 78 with dry-combo skin in summer and since I’ve been using Retin A for years, my skin is minimally wrinkled but I have labial and marionette lines around my mouth which foundations love to settle in. The TirTir looked a little makeupy on my forehead, but natural overall. It didn’t settle into lines or wrinkles. It’s tricky to apply though. If you press down enough to get product on the pad, it’s way too much to apply directly to skin. Rubbing the pad on the inside lid and then applying to face will still result in too heavy a coat. I learned to just pick up just the tiniest bit on the pad, then rub on the lid, then press the whole pad on the lid and then apply. I also tried using a damp sponge which I patted on the product left in the lid. Both those techniques gave me a more natural finish. It did last all day but got pretty glowy. I powdered lightly after 5 hours and it looked great. Unfortunately I got 27N and it’s a tad too dark &amp; yellow for my skin tone so I ordered the sample kit from Amazon for less than $2 so I can try some different colors before I order again.",

            "if u press the puff lightly in the foundation or just simply press half the puff on the foundation ever so lightly it will pick very less amount which is actually enough to cover the whole face, u will not need any brush or blender to smooth out...btw thanks for showing in natural light in zoomed in focus",
            "You pressed to many times, one light touch will cover your face and then add a second layer for more coverage. do not press so hard and no more than one dip onto the cushion.",

I understand orange cancels red, apparently, but if your skin is pink, I need it to match , not to cancel. Anyway, I hope those of you who have a shade match enjoy this one.",

            "Omg u are so pretty, girl🥰",
            "As someone with light medium skin tone<br>I would never touch those shades. They couldn&#39;t wait to release the deeper tones and let you review them?",
            "Just wondering what you guys gonna do with the shades that you don&#39;t use 😅",
            "Dang! You look so beautiful!😮",

            "Wow! That looks so good! But your skin is beautiful so it has a great surface to work with! I wonder what it will look like with a color that matches your skin. I am sure it will be striking!",
            "ok but the fact that it eventuall blended in to your actual color is INSANE",
            "That needs to be a tad bit darker and it’ll be perfect."

            "Tirtir actually has SIX or SEVEN different types in their cushion line and the silver snd pink arent new, they&#39;ve been around for about a year already. What&#39;s new is the shade range expansion. Would love for research beforehand so the video doesnt give misinformation thanks!",

            "Tati, will they be selling their sponges so that you can change them out and be able to try to clean them and not keep using the same sponge over and over again",
            "Tati, have you found that the Vitamin C has an odd scent once it’s been sitting on the skin for awhile? It’s not a perfume or added fragrance, just really weird. I don’t know how to describe it. You’re absolutely correct to the quality of their skincare though. I love the cleansing balm and enzyme cleanser, along with their Niacinamide with Retinol Serum. The milky toner is a bit heavy for me, but the light version is wonderful!",
            "How do we get the correct shade without having to purchase them all to test???",
            "I use the red one. I like it, but it transfers a lot.",
            "I have no idea why I&#39;ve been resisting the cushions because I LOVE their skincare line. I think the shade match was freaking me out. Got the red cushion mini and nailed the color on the first try. OMG. I don&#39;t know what kind of magic is in this stuff, but it&#39;s amazing. It stays all day without a primer or spray. I don&#39;t want to claw my skin off at the end of the day. It doesn&#39;t settle into pores or lines (I&#39;m in my 50s with drier skin). And I want to buy a million of the minis for my purse. I also think I can get away with the mini in my purse on a plane without having to put it in my liquids bag, which is a huge bonus for me. The fact that it&#39;s $15-$25 depending on size is a huge bonus. I have a graveyard of foundation bottles that I can now get rid of for good. If you&#39;ve been on the fence like me, just try it. So good.",
