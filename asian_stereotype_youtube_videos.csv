But I am very obsessed with pale skin because of classism. I know it was a wrong mindset, but I can&#39;t really get rid of it.; This just seems like straigjt up racism. How dare anyone make someone feel inadequate because of the color of their skin. That should be the last thing that matters when it comes to hiring someone.; In Italy is the opposite; Nah bro, I speak spanish and I can say that was nasty and weird, I&#39;ve never imaginated someone saying that in live...; As a black person who is darker than my sister my relatives praise her for having lighter skin and it’s honestly just stupid at this point. 🙂‍↕️; Some people hate their skin colour just because they think white skin colour is more attractive!!! People are ashamed of their skin colour!!!! There is no other reason.; Being told my whole life I&#39;m &quot;too pasty&quot; and look like the grudge only to find out that theres a whole culture bleaching their skin is wild. None of it makes sense!; Most anime characters look Caucasian af to me.; 早在东亚人见到白人之前，他们就已经开始追求白色的皮肤了。在古代中国，如果你拥有更白的皮肤，这代表你更富有，因为你不会因为从事体力劳动而被晒黑。在许多中国古代文学著作中都会用皮肤白来夸奖一个女孩很美。; I&#39;m whiter than most my peers (I&#39;m SE Asian) and I&#39;ve gotten so much compliments on my complexion ever since I was a kid, even though I don&#39;t really fit any other beauty standard. I don&#39;t get compliments very often, but when I do, it&#39;s most likely about how white I am. it sometimes makes me feel like the only thing good about myself is my pale skin. but even my pale ass isn&#39;t enough, I&#39;ve heard &quot;wow you&#39;ve gotten a little darker, you were whiter a few years ago&quot; or &quot;wear sunscreen, you&#39;re getting a bit darker&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re not as white as them(highly edited picture online)&quot; they make it a competition?<br><br>it&#39;s quite sad, and even though I don&#39;t agree with the whole whiter/paler=better thing, sometimes I subconsciously hope I was even whiter, which just shows how deep the idea is ingrained into my brain. imagine how it&#39;s like for other Asians with darker skin; I wonder how us Americans can convince the childern of Asian immigrants to abandon the obsession with being pale; If they want to have white skin and that would make them happy as long as nobody is getting hurt then who am I or you or everybody to judge. They can do whatever they want.; Loved your content. Really appreciate it. ❤; Where I&#39;m at, light skin will imply you spend most of your time indoors because of either mental illness or you don&#39;t have the funds to travel.<br><br>Tan skin implies you&#39;ve traveled, your active, athletic, exotic to some degree; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRlnYnbv8ao"">https://youtu.be/cRlnYnbv8ao?si=_nBvSQ1wYT6o3Mz_</a>; I used to be light in skin tone when I was a baby, but when I got older I got a lot darker. I remember my parents telling me I ruined my skin, especially my mum, even now she throws the odd comment or two about it. I&#39;m not attractive for the beauty standards too- it&#39;s an honest truth and I know what I look like - but it still hurts to know that I wont be considered attractive both in the country I was born in or the country my parents are from. These days I&#39;ve accepted my looks but I remember being young and wanting to be lighter, sometimes I think about even now but its more so a voice in the back of my head. No matter what I do with my looks I won&#39;t be happy cause I&#39;ll continuously try and fix flaws, so I&#39;ve learned to be more neutral about my appearance. Like my legs help me get to places like a coffee shop, how even if I have bad eyesight and wear glasses I can still do the hobbies I love like reading. I feel like body positivity doesn&#39;t really work on me since I just don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s true for mebut being neutral helps me with hopefully one day being happy in the body that I have.; we always want thing we aren&#39;t huh; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRlnYnbv8ao&amp;t=283"">4:43</a>, i speak fluent spanish, that was mostly gibberish, but at then end sounds like she says &quot;culo&quot; which is a vulgar term for buttocks; White is a weak or recessed gene.  Darker skin is the stronger gene.  I&#39;ve spent time in Asia.  You guys want to be white baaaad.  And guess what...you will never be accepted as white.  I spent two hours in Korea and the people didn&#39;t seem so pre occupied with being white.  I flew to the Philippines in 2018. Non the way back I spent time in Korea.  I saw two girls who were so white they looked like ghosts.  They literally looked scary as hell.  As much as Asia talks about being culturally proud it seems you&#39;d do anything to be white.  Being white in no way means you&#39;re any better than anyone else.  White people in the world aren&#39;t elevated because they are smarter or better but because of the brutality they&#39;ve inflicted in holding people who don&#39;t look like them back.  Governments should enact laws to punish businesses that discriminate in the basis of color.  Truly sad.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRlnYnbv8ao&amp;t=249"">4:09</a> which kpop guy is this with the blue hair he is hot; i&#39;m olive skin😅 my friend always comparing my skin to others and told me my skin looks weird not even fit the white yellow brown or black😂 i told her why(she compares my skin colour) but she didn&#39;t even answer my question, she keeps doing this until i graduates from my highschool😅 i&#39;m so insecure <a href=""http://about.my/"">about.my</a> greenish kind of skin colour and she makes it worse😅 any of you guys knows and don&#39;t mind to share what else haor colour fits olive skin tho except black bcs i look older with this colour😢; &quot;ane caca ne culo&quot; in spanish means &quot;ane poo ne butt&quot;; Also a Polard bear descends from a Brown bear not the other way around.

Hmmmmmm ???; As a Black person who adores Asian culture I admire you so much for speaking on subjects like this, colorism is ruining our world; The black bear and white bear add is wild. As a black person, it kinda hurts. The fact that whiter skin means higher chance to have a better life is true and hurtful. Am I the only one who laughed slightly when I learned the models weren&#39;t even indians?; It is so sad that people don’t love who they are and worry about other people not loving their skin. I am brown skin  and either people want to be like use or hate us, which is crazy. Whether people love me or not, I think I am beautiful in my skin. Just love yourself.; Can we talk about you &amp; your eyes . . .; as a naturally pale person, I hate the Western concept of &quot;healthy tan&quot; because the Sun will slowly destroy your skin until you become a wrinkly leather bag. Yes, a lot of rich people have that look but it still looks bad. Naturally dark skin is just natural sunscreen, and people mocking you for it may get skin cancer that you never will so the joke&#39;s on them; Goddamn. Some of those people make my white ass look pale.; Lmao, this is hilarious 😂 I actually feel sad for them.; Did you say the N WORD. ?; I love to have very white skin but its because I&#39;m goth and my beauty standard is to look like I&#39;m already dead 🧛🏻‍♀️😂<br>Besides I love every skin color on other people.

It scavenges for reactive oxygen and antioxidants and eliminates free radicals. It also aids in immune system support and reduces in species. It boosts inflammation in your body. This is a dangerous game the anterior delusional ppl are playing! Eurocentric people have imbued the whole world with their faux standards of beauty because they do not have melanin in their bodies like in other cultures. If I look pale, it is so wonderful; why did they create sun tan lotion, and why do they risk skin cancer by spending endless hours basking in the sun? They do not even like being pale; they have made some ppl of color hate themselves with their lies and other BS! God made all of us different for a reason, and if He wanted everyone to be Eurocentric, He would have created us that way. Stop listening to their Neo-colonizing bull crap, period!; I think light skin can be beautiful but that being said racism and colorism is wrong, using toxic chemicals is definitely something to be avoided.; Lightskins stay winning.; In india if you were poor but had fair skin you would be treated better then the other dil who was rich but had dark skin so yes white skin matters in india same as children born white or dark treated differently by parents and family members; I love my melanin skin so much 🫶🏾🙏🏾; Goodness shake! I didn&#39;t know that type of world exist. Sad.; By the way you are funny 😂; I’m a black woman and I’m sorry for those who are not accepted in the own skin, regardless of what shade you are.

Come people let’s get it together ❤; See it&#39;s normal just know that blacks will always get that stereotypical judgement 😂 from people around the world even in our own community it even happens <br>They even did an experiment with two kids about the age of 4 or 5 they placed a black and a white doll 1 kid was white the other kid was black then they questioned them on who was the good doll both kids pointed at the white doll then asked then asked who was the bad/evil and ugly doll both kids pointed at the black doll😂; Historically for beauty standards, whatever was associated with being richer was considered “beautiful.”  <br><br>In the Middle Ages when tan skin was associated with being a peasant who worked outside, then fairer skin was “in.” But in the 50s in the US, when a tan meant you could afford plane tickets and a beach vacation, then a bunch of Irish immigrant kids in the US wanted a deep tan, despite the skin damage the UV exposure caused.; I know that this was posted a year ago, but I just want to say that I think that we all should love the skin you&#39;re in. As a black American, I am happy that I have dark skin and I have always admired foreign brown skin. It&#39;s a shame that people want to be a different color, and that&#39;s not how we were born. It&#39;s sad that people judge you because of the color of your skin. A lot of Caucasian people get tans to make their skin color dark like some foreign people.; this Guy is Not real.. He Talks Like an Ki; Great video! I&#39;m somewhat familiar with colourism in the USA and knew it existed in Asia but never had this kind of insight into it before.

My life is so hard!; This is absurd; I want to audition for a kpop company but my skin is darker than the korean standards and that is why i am always hesitant about even trying; I only react to the title for now. Some that&#39;s enough to say something. Why, because it seems to me as passive aggressive and click bait.<br><br>It is not neutral and it adds to the belief that people hate skin color. <br><br>In my opinion they don&#39;t hate it. Instead they fear judgement, mai treatment, inferiority feelings.  It is about societal pressure. <br><br>Babies are never born with a preference for skin color. That says enough and something about the intelligent way nature works.<br><br>Non authenticity, groupthink and other mainstream ever perpetual myth roam society and clutter our thoughts. It is a testament to the pertinent lack of freedom of the mind. It is not about growing up, becoming a thought leader. <br><br>Also, discrimination is so subtle. Fair skin, as if dark skin is unfair. If you analyse speech and choice of words then many such subtleties come to the forefront. Likewise light skin term. It is about non relevant details uttered in mainstream mindlessness.  Never an intelligent conversation about deep meaning. Always impatient, belonging to whatever wimps the collective mind has. Critical thinking is not part of any curriculum, because in order to do so, one needs self reflection. What is it that I am doing, what do I feel and why. Introspection is one of the most scary skills one can have.nit can crumble a person to pieces, but also nurture a Phoenix.; As an African American that bear video shocked me, never in my life have I seen something so……heart wrenching.; I have never seen that indian advertisement /song or whatever it was.

I like to see those studies and the long or even short term consequences.; I saw a survey once and it said that on average people viewed fair skin as more feminine and darker skin as more masculine. It’s really interesting considering a lot of people in this video chasing fair skin were women.; Every Asian woman I&#39;ve ever thought was beautiful had tanned warm looking skin.  I think it&#39;s sad they don&#39;t take more pride in their own skin, instead they want to have  white skin.

I am not dark nor fair, i do use se cream to avoid skin sun damage and early wrinkles. I like to have a skin routine to take care of myself but not to the point of Obsession. “Imperfection is Beauty” Love yourself and be happy inside, you will look more beautiful 🤩; My mom use to get mad at me for being tan and having curly hair…Mind you her husband/ my dad is Puerto Rican!!! 🙄; I have light brown skin, a black man; I have no problem with skin color.

I thank the Most High God for my melanated skin that protects me from harmful UVA rays.; I’m a typical Caucasian woman. When I was born the doctors had to put me under the window because I was too white. I have had serious issues in my life with my white skin. I burn severely and my skin cannot tolerate the sun.

True, it’s sad that people think this way, but it has nothing to do with who you are on the inside. There are many white skinned people who are not the ideal candidate.

Like they hairstyle is clearly so boring and look not unique at all (sadly Indonesian people is too obsessed to korean beauty standards); I appreciate your videos because sometimes I need something to bring me back to reality and say it&#39;s okay to be you.; I&#39;m a black woman and I LOVE the skin I&#39;m in, I&#39;ve always been proud to be black, it&#39;s who I am.

Some that&#39;s enough to say something. Why, because it seems to me as passive aggressive and click bait.<br><br>It is not neutral and it adds to the belief that people hate skin color. <br><br>In my opinion they don&#39;t hate it. Instead they fear judgement, mai treatment, inferiority feelings.  It is about societal pressure. <br><br>Babies are never born with a preference for skin color. That says enough and something about the intelligent way nature works.<br><br>Non authenticity, groupthink and other mainstream ever perpetual myth roam society and clutter our thoughts. It is a testament to the pertinent lack of freedom of the mind. It is not about growing up, becoming a thought leader. <br><br>Also, discrimination is so subtle. Fair skin, as if dark skin is unfair. If you analyse speech and choice of words then many such subtleties come to the forefront. Likewise light skin term. It is about non relevant details uttered in mainstream mindlessness.  Never an intelligent conversation about deep meaning. Always impatient, belonging to whatever wimps the collective mind has. Critical thinking is not part of any curriculum, because in order to do so, one needs self reflection. What is it that I am doing, what do I feel and why. Introspection is one of the most scary skills one can have.nit can crumble a person to pieces, but also nurture a Phoenix.; As an African American that bear video shocked me, never in my life have I seen something so……heart wrenching.; I have never seen that indian advertisement /song or whatever it was.

Why would i erase my skin colour just to look like someone else; Omg !!! 😱 Why do Asians not have Asian eyes, their skin color is supposed to look like the Simpsons 🤗 You definitely have makeup and plastic surgery!!!😡; 😂😂its sometimes sounds weird into some of our ears you guys gat a nyc skin and color that some of Africans admire but still u don&#39;t appreciate it 😂😂😂 and u have to whiten it a bit so that u look nice hihi.; Shouldnt it be called &quot;snow white&quot; drip lol; Remember when tan kpop idols existed?; Can you imagine that since these products literally take out or inhibit the natural melanin in your skin, what will happen later and the poison thats seeping in will do in the long run! I like to see those studies and the long or even short term consequences.; I saw a survey once and it said that on average people viewed fair skin as more feminine and darker skin as more masculine. It’s really interesting considering a lot of people in this video chasing fair skin were women.; Every Asian woman I&#39;ve ever thought was beautiful had tanned warm looking skin.  I think it&#39;s sad they don&#39;t take more pride in their own skin, instead they want to have  white skin.

I like to have a skin routine to take care of myself but not to the point of Obsession. “Imperfection is Beauty” Love yourself and be happy inside, you will look more beautiful 🤩; My mom use to get mad at me for being tan and having curly hair…Mind you her husband/ my dad is Puerto Rican!!! 🙄; I have light brown skin, a black man; I have no problem with skin color.

I thank the Most High God for my melanated skin that protects me from harmful UVA rays.; I’m a typical Caucasian woman. When I was born the doctors had to put me under the window because I was too white. I have had serious issues in my life with my white skin. I burn severely and my skin cannot tolerate the sun.

Japanese like pale skin is true, but the reason why Maiko and geisha use pure-white foundation is that Japanese haven’t produced beige-colored foundation until 20th century; they only had 3 colors for makeup: black, white and red. Also Maiko and geisha work indoor, at evening, where they can use candle light, and the white foundation is the best choice to let their face differentiable.; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ironic, since you are exactly those things you talked about in this video; Thank you for mentioning all East Asian, not just China.

My auntie doesn&#39;t keep her kids out in the sun for long to keep their skin from &quot;tanning/darkening&quot; which I think isn&#39;t necessary. Also, if you&#39;re too skinny, a family member would always comment on it and say that you need to eat more but it you gain weight? They still comment on it, saying that you need to lose weight. I&#39;m not saying that everyone is like this btw. It&#39;s just mainly the aunties imo.; Just funny that you’re complaining about it but you fit it all😅; As a southerner (in North America) every fair skinned person I know ends up looking pink (hence the term &quot;Red Neck&quot;) which may or may not be the reason why in America people prefer tanned complexions. A tan, at least in America suggests you have the time and money to sun bathe on the beach or play sports and are not constantly cooped up in your house/factory/office. (look at Donald Trump, dude sank a dozen college tuitions worth into turning orange).; Wow, god definitely has his favorites; If a woman is beautiful, she is beautiful. Doesn&#39;t matter if she&#39;s white, black, brown, yellow, or whatever. Things like beauty standards are mostly for the average, to make themselves stand out. And for your second point, being thin is just natural, and everyone should be thin. Because it&#39;s the most healthy for your body, and you look the best. However, if you&#39;re too thin, that&#39;s also not good either, and you can have a certain grade of fat, and still look good. For example, recently, when I was in iceland, I saw an asian girl (not too sure which country prob like indo, thai, philippines), and she had some fat (of course much less than overweight her waist still quite a bit thinner than her hips), and she was absolutely beautiful. But that was a healthy amount of fat, a natural amount of fat, and a healthily built amount of fat. People these days just take it too far and being drastically overweight not only overshadows your facial features but also shows that you only eat shit.; As an Asian man who grew up in the west, I prefer tanned healthy looking girls who are athletic.; Good thing i never met with any of those problems with having naturaly darker skin (i live in a country where ppl naturally have more fair skin). Having a good tan (by good tan i mean same tone all over body) was considered beautiful. Even now with asian culture popularity and therefore their standarts being wide spread i still faced no discrimination or being considered &quot;ugly&quot;. I&#39;m glad i have grown up when asian standarts were not all over the place, bcs i know i would&#39;ve have been greatly affected by it.; I wonder how these extreme diets are affecting their hormones cause personally, when I&#39;m on my period, I crave a lot of things; Wow you are gorgeous ❤; Pale skin was popular far before European Imperialism, it was present even during Japans isolationism.; It is a bit scary. Like what are they getting sick for? Attention from men?; white people be like: da fux?; Yeah, thise weight standards are sick! I don&#39;t think that skin color or being slim is attractive. Taking care of your looks makes you attractive, no matter which body type or skin color.; The gender pay gap isnt real and has been debunked so many times. The fact that you used that to further your point about the supposed patriarchy just invalidates your opinion; The whole beauty standard issue is very simple: you do NOT have to follow it. BUT just don&#39;t expect or force people to find you attractive. simple.; Older white Australian male - Chinese, Japanese and most Asian women are actually quite beautiful - naturally ! In fact spoilt by plastic surgery, starvation diets, trying to meet ‘stereotypes’ and apparently’filters’ that radically alter body shape, features etc. Natural beauty is best in my opinion. Western women are actually worse - Botox lips, massive breast implants, dyed blond hair etc. I also prefer darker skin - I come from the land of natural suntans ! Pity darker Asian women spend so much on trying to bleach their skin white ! Societal and peer pressure and as above - stereotypes ! Very intelligent and informative video ! Like your stuff !; in spain oale skin was also related to wealth but then it changed when beach vacations became very popular, now if you got darker skin you can afford to go to the beach a lot; They might not say it, but it&#39;s universal. The West was also like that until relatively recently.; are you telling the reason I like white skin tone because someone told me to do so?; Your videos have such deep content and insight. Thank you for the great work you put in your videos. Societies, especially the interdependent ones you mention, have to come up with incentives that favors acceptance for a wide variety of &#39;looks&#39;. This echoes the education video you made where choices are narrowed down because of contrary incentives at the individual level and everyone gets a worse experience. How does one encourage a broader view of beauty?

This increases competitive pressure since the upper 1-5% of the most attractive women can now leverage their attractiveness unrestricted to gain massive competitive advantages with regards to the dating market or anywhere else where being attractive is beneficial (which is basically everywhere).

We all know how weird japanese are around these things....; To me, everything already starts wrong the second they told them &quot;your value is based on how you look&quot; that&#39;s the biggest lie asian women are believing in, it&#39;s what is holding them back. Someone is much more than just their looks. Honesty, perseverance and kindness are much more important.<br><br>Another thing that keeps bothering me is this obsession with youth.

I am a competitive swimmer who swims in the sun, so I’m like bronze atm. What I have noticed is that, nowadays my folks would not comment explicitly on someone who was born dark but will openly mock someone who “chose” to get dark. This was so weird to me. I realised that these people don’t know the work I put in to appear “dark” if you can say that.

Japanese like pale skin is true, but the reason why Maiko and geisha use pure-white foundation is that Japanese haven’t produced beige-colored foundation until 20th century; they only had 3 colors for makeup: black, white and red. Also Maiko and geisha work indoor, at evening, where they can use candle light, and the white foundation is the best choice to let their face differentiable.; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ironic, since you are exactly those things you talked about in this video; Thank you for mentioning all East Asian, not just China.

My auntie doesn&#39;t keep her kids out in the sun for long to keep their skin from &quot;tanning/darkening&quot; which I think isn&#39;t necessary. Also, if you&#39;re too skinny, a family member would always comment on it and say that you need to eat more but it you gain weight? They still comment on it, saying that you need to lose weight.

Doesn&#39;t matter if she&#39;s white, black, brown, yellow, or whatever. Things like beauty standards are mostly for the average, to make themselves stand out. And for your second point, being thin is just natural, and everyone should be thin. Because it&#39;s the most healthy for your body, and you look the best. However, if you&#39;re too thin, that&#39;s also not good either, and you can have a certain grade of fat, and still look good. For example, recently, when I was in iceland, I saw an asian girl (not too sure which country prob like indo, thai, philippines), and she had some fat (of course much less than overweight her waist still quite a bit thinner than her hips), and she was absolutely beautiful. But that was a healthy amount of fat, a natural amount of fat, and a healthily built amount of fat. People these days just take it too far and being drastically overweight not only overshadows your facial features but also shows that you only eat shit.; As an Asian man who grew up in the west, I prefer tanned healthy looking girls who are athletic.; Good thing i never met with any of those problems with having naturaly darker skin (i live in a country where ppl naturally have more fair skin).

In fact spoilt by plastic surgery, starvation diets, trying to meet ‘stereotypes’ and apparently’filters’ that radically alter body shape, features etc. Natural beauty is best in my opinion.

I&#39;ve been struggling with a depressive episode for a while now, and my skin has taken the toll. My pores look so visible lately. It started making me feel like crap and I rarely go on social media, but I watch a lot of YouTube, so I&#39;m still exposed to content that&#39;s probably only showing the best image of individuals on screen (altered or not). I seriously started to think about learning how to properly do my makeup to hide away, but I&#39;m sure my skin will fix itself once I get out of this episode and get back to my skincare routine (daily showering and applying moisturizer). I&#39;m trying, and your videos have been helpful for my mental health ❤; Why does trisha have  hands like a 450 lb woman?; I recently came across your channel and I love your humour 😆; why are your eyes blue; I have had the worst acne since I hit pueberty and have always been really insecure about it. I literally hated going outside because I felt hideous...I&#39;m 16 now, and my acne is still really bad, but watching videos like this have really helped me get some of my self-esteem again!; I know that preventative skin care for children under 12 is something that can be effective:  For instance, anything that prevents oily skin and/or Acne from starting!  I could have used Proactiv, Acnease, Accutane starting in the fifth grade, to prevent Acne from starting!  Back in the Day!; This is a big reality shock because it genuinely feels as if it came from a parody because like this is so incredibly ingrained into our society and holy crap; video transported me immediately to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTswyuoEB80&amp;t=9"">0:09</a>, i was on a rollercoaster; This video has genuinely made me tear up because for so long I&#39;ve been obsessed with having the most perfect, smooth skin, and have always been insecure of my acne, and I&#39;ve never been able to achieve what I wanted.. And now I know why - it&#39;s normal to have uneven, blemished skin. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve let myself be tricked by this- 😭😭 <br>Thank you for showing me that I was wrong🙏; You have the nicest and most effective requesting of likes and comments that I&#39;ve seen 😄 also i love your videos. Keep it up!; dude this content is very hypocritical, on one hand you&#39;re saying that people have flaws and then you&#39;re video shows you wearing tons of makeup to look like the people you&#39;re warning us against. Pick a lane.; &quot;If your age is only one digit, its okay to be like those people for  the time being &quot; 😂; One thing that leads to insecurities among certain beauty standards is the white washing that Korean pop idols and actors often do. Lightening creams, bleaches, and injections are becoming more popular all around the country due to these filters that makes the persons skin extremely white and clear.; Me with freckles sitting in the corner😢; Perfect skin does exist. Many young people around have perfect skin.; I&#39;m sorry when I saw jackson I got so happy 😊; The celeb photos especially Ariana’s pic were a really great reality check.; Baekhyun = Kyle XY confirmed; MICHELLE PHAN ;__;; just wanna say i was here for your long hair working at sephora days 🫶🏾 you&#39;ve come so far !!; Anal Uisa; This world has gone insane...; Kylie doesn&#39;t even use her own products lmao... It&#39;s all just a big cash grab.; when are we gonna get a edvasian haircare and skincare daily routine vid, waiitng patiently; I have depression and adhd autism with some kind of severe lack of energy so i usually wash my face with a rag and water ..on a good day. And the only time my face makes issues is when its either bleed time or.. after i washed my face with products.. which happens maybe every 2 weeks<br><br>Like maybe i just dont have the &#39;right&#39; products but.. if my face makes no issues for me while im washing it vaguely with water twice a week i dont think the issue is a Wrong product..<br>And that is as someone who has/had acne..; Just make sure the lines you develop are laughter lines.; Quick note: those &#39;hollywood celebrity real skin&#39; photos have been edited to make them worse.  the sharpen sliders have been upped to make texture more obvious; it&#39;s why it looks like they have pits for pores and they start to look sort of pixelated.  that set of photos are famous for being anti-beauty photoshopped; My skin has never been better since I only use unscented $10-for-500mg Cetaphil moisturizer and nothing else. I feel like the more expensive the product is, the worst it actually is. It&#39;s a scam.; also skin clarity is majorly genetic like my shit is always clear (unless im stressed and than i get 1 pimple)  and i - dont do anything i have alot of allergies tho so i couldnt really do much regardless of if my face was clear (i get body pimples tho but cleansing hydrating and leaving it alone is usually what your skin is asking for) . its so beyond important to see a dermatologist if your suffering from any kind of skin problems!! hell it could BE an allergy TO the expensive ass makeup youre buying to fix the problem its causing! also hydration is important and nutrition - your not gonna have clear skin while youre not taking care of yourself your skin is your largest organ!!; I am skeptical about the powder foundation because those girls were rubbing it on (potentially dry) while the influencer was dabbing with a wet beauty blender. Those two techniques will bring out very different results.; I agree. All those spots on their faces are due to too much makeup and especially at the skin not breathing and being malnourished. Nowadays, there is too much filteting on social media that people have forgotten reality. I am a 58 years old actor, and my skin is flawless. There are no spots due to too much makeup, as I have olive and oily skin, I don&#39;t really need to put heavy makeup on my face. In fact , makeup artists, when they work on my face, they just apply some Primer and some powder. I don&#39;t need to put on two inches of foundation to look perfect, as I would look really stupid. People. Drink what I drink to have a flawless skin. I drink Korean Boricha/Mugicha, and believe me, it works wonders 😊; I feel like the look of visible foundation on skin is worse than whatever blemishes people might have. Those celebrities with acne would look better in those photos if their foundation wasn&#39;t highlighting all their flaws.; &quot;It melts the pow-da into the skin...&quot;; no they noticed her neck. but the thing with fat girls is they SWEAT. so , when you have orange makeup on your neck ....its gonna smudge; my skin is baby smooth to the touch lately , on my face, barely have any acne aside from tiny white stuff. not a black head just dead skin build up. and im still like , paranoid i look like i did in higschool. &quot;pizzaface&quot; my own fucking parents said. so fuck all these fake people who brainwashed girls into thinking actual smooth skin is EVEN REMOTELY REAL IN HUMANS. WE ARENT FUCKING DOLPHINS; OH MY GOD! I haven&#39;t seen Michelle Phan&#39;s face in so long. That tiny clip felt like a hug.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTswyuoEB80&amp;t=688"">11:28</a> I&#39;m worried about the amount of makeup that dog is ingesting; My friend went to a kpop group concert and posted a photo where all the girls have slightly different skin tones. I used to think how they all look ghostly white but in reality they all look like me bruh💀; So. My and yours imperfect skin is probably much better than most celebs&#39; skin.<br><br>And if you don&#39;t agree your skin is better, you, no matter who you are, have something which is better than what they have, especially knowing that their whole life is &quot;Photoshopped&quot;, you know your issues, your demons, you don&#39;t know theirs. What if you are a better knitter, driver, or sus customer detector, or doctor, or you are better at managing your life on your own without extra hire... Mass media made them more visible, and they are managed to show their best sides, and it&#39;s not because they are better in general that they are popular, it&#39;s because they and their teams are producing them as a popular product. Which also doesn&#39;t make those people in any way bad, some people are actors or singers, others are &quot;invisible&quot; like their makeup artists, it&#39;s just makeup artist job (and a ginormous list of other jobs) is, in general, not public, not on camera.<br><br>I think a thought, but I don&#39;t know how to express it concisely 😖; i remember when nct 127 did a photoshoot where none of the pics were edited and they got hate for it 😭; Hm - my skin isn&#39;t perfect, but I like it. Probably because I&#39;m lazy 😂; If you actually speak to your dermatologist, they will tell you gentle cleanser, gentle moisturizer, and sunscreen along with a healthy diet is how you actually get/maintain great skin. Collagen doesn’t absorb through the skin, you actually have to digest it and put it inside your body for it to work. Great skin as perfect doesn’t exist in reality. I use lighting not filters as I am Gen X and that’s how we took great photos (but being around real life humans more often to not be confused as to what humans actually look like). People who wear insane amounts of makeup, normally have the worst skin; it’s logical; Believe it or not .i have almost perfect skin. People think im wearing makeup and im not. I drink lots of water and i use something really simple at night . Vaseline..i kid you not. I have beautiful skin; U shouldn’t use filter; Ah, imagine I&#39;ve seen a friend choosing his matches on tinder. He picked only the ladies with the most make up and filters. He kept coming back to me, complaining that the ladies he met did not look like the pictures. 😂; what I really dislike about this trend too, is that many people act as if it’s easily achievable within a week as long as you have the correct products. people sometimes compliment me on my skin but I always tell them that it is the result of a consistent skincare routine I’ve had for 6 years. it’s not overnight, it’s habit that after years can show good results.; No such thing as perfect skin.; Are you cosplaying as a Midwestern emo teenager ?; Love your videos; I bought an oppo phone recently and the filters that are already on my camera is crazy!; I am 30 yo woman. I do use water and a dish rag to wash my face because I am allergic to most cosmetic products. Don&#39;t use make up except for neutral eye shadow. Didn&#39;t had a break out in years.; Almost insulted she tried to pass that off as a powder foundation when it was clearly creame.; Good video; My daughter uses retinol at 12 because i got it for her😂 but its not for wrinkles, its for acne scars which she was already really self conscious over. &amp; it makes us both break out a lot less. I had to get her some once i watched my face full of acne scars completely disappear in 2-3 months &amp; i even stopped breaking out❤ Its cerave retinol resurfacing serum in case anyones wondering, itll get rid of the red scars &amp; the deep ones!; I had the worst freaking skin my whole life &amp; now its as perfect as my skin could ever naturally be thanks to a bunch of products that were all less than $20 each❤ my scars are gone, the deep ones and the red marks, my big pores and blackheads are gone, my skin texture is awesome now! Try cerave retinol skin resurfacing serum &amp; Pacifica kale charcoal mask ❤<br>Also, elfs dead skin peel stuff &amp; vitamin c make a huge difference! <br>&amp; cetaphil makes the BEST daily face wash!<br>Oh oh &amp; my skin was already so much better from those products but i literally havent broken out ONCE since i added paulas choice exfoliant, even while PMSing🫨<br>I know the whole point was that we shouldnt worry so much about our skin but my self confidence has gotten SO much better lately so i still had to share in case anyone else is struggling ❤; I have cystic acne on one cheek. I like doing artsy makeup looks sometimes and I always get really self conscious with one half of my face looking ideal and the other half breaking out. I needed this video 🫶; I&#39;m 24 and I have never used face wash and I have barely ever had acne. Whenever I try to use acne wash I break out. Feels sort of suspicious. Idk.; Even when you are aware of how fake everything is, sometimes is hard to not get frustrated when you remember that the sking you&#39;ve been working so hard on, looks nothing like the glass skins online or kdramas; Its specially sad because you know all these celebs invest a lot of money in facials and skin care and, even if they have great skin, they/their teams still feel the need to edit the f out of their photos until they look like porcelain dolls; Much better hair and looks now...and if you could remove your colour contacts you&#39;ll look much better.; he has the perfect skin; Edvasios! Keep preaching, I love your personality!; We all come into this world with a physical form, and we have the right to exist in it as it is without shame.; The missing bellybutton got me. 😂; I love your videos, I have just discovered you.; I never had a problem with acne growing up so I wouldn’t know what to use..I don’t wear makeup..tinted sunscreen..the brightest red lipstick 💄 on special occasions..Since I was 16 years old I’ve used Noxzema and Neutrogena soap..I’m 59..and it’s still..in my opinion..the best to use..they cleanse and clean my face..things surely have changed..👍🏽continue to encourage young ones to be their youthful fresh face💎selves🫶🏽; it&#39;s the  everybody so creative for me <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>; I remember seeing a person comment under a picture of a k-pop celebrity that was fairly old something like “they got so good genetics, they’re so perfect”. I replied with “remember that they use tons of filters and photoshop” but they just didn’t acknowledge it, they just continued to say that the celebrity is natural. It’s sad.; Skincare and makeup in the morning before putting on my glasses is like a real life filter 😂; All I want is a healthy normal skin like what my husband has. But I have to keep fighting acne every day and nothing is ever good enough. It already takes so much time, I can&#39;t imagine spending even more time in the bathroom doing makeup. I don&#39;t have 2 hours every day for this shit.; Also, I hate how people with acne are perceived as lazy. In my case, it&#39;s literally genetic and I have an active skincare routine, but my gene pool doesn&#39;t give a shit. I never had a say in my condition and can only ensure it does not deteriorate. (my father had acne till he turned 30); I kinda don&#39;t hate wrinkels though. Especially the ones you get from smiling. They show a person is happy in my opinion, or has a fun life. So I actually like seeing laugh lines.; I don&#39;t understand how people buy that celebrities are showing photos &quot;bare faced&quot; when you can clearly see that they&#39;re wearing a bunch of makeup 😂; The way u imitated mikayla ☠️ so accurate bye; fr tho skincare is so damn expensive and i&#39;m allergic to linalool (a component in lavender oil that everyone and their mom puts in every product) and I felt like an absolute moron for not having a skincare routine. Also It&#39;s kinda messed up how anti aging products demonize old age and wrinkles so much that as a college student I&#39;m expected to have an anti aging routine; Love your videos!; Thank you, after watching this material I realize my skin is sooo much better without any fancy product or filter. I&#39;m happy with what I have. &lt;3; Are you mixed Asian or something because yr too big for Asian so speak?; This guy comes off as a hater; I do retouching! We can separate out the texture of your skin and literally make your pores look perfect while blurring the tones underneath. <br><br>Don’t even get me STARTED on the hair retouching black magic. Trust me, nobody’s real hair is in any high end photo. I’ll even hand draw in parts that are too frizzy. It is totally insane how realistic this stuff can look now; Omg Michelle Phan ♡ The og; UNRELATED BUT U KINDA LOOK LIKE CHOERRY; My skin is damn near flawless most of the time (just in regard to pimples) - break outs during stress, but usually clear <br><br>My secret? Ed is completely right - do less. I use basic cheap facial wash (with 3% salicylic acid which is essentially aspirin) and occasionally moisturise with a cheap cocoa butter product or with some pure coconut oil - cheap from the health food section <br><br>Wearing makeup very very infrequently and avoiding the sun damage are the main things that I recommend to everyone who wants nice skin long term - sunscreen is always a better option than that $100 cream that is lying when it says it will undo that sun damage; My skin looks better in the mirror than on camera and now I&#39;m starting to look weird even with basic filters; Not just filters. Also the makeup layers these days are insane. Back in my day (i am 32) a cc cream was for weddings. We did not put on makeup everyday.; I&#39;m the water/ dish rag person and my skin has never looked better; She caked that powder on, and did she use painters tape for the line?; I get told I have perfect skin a /lot. / I never wear makeup, know my skin type, and take care of it. The end. I don&#39;t spend a lot of money on my skincare products either.; I have had bad acne on my cheeks for awhile. I&#39;m 22 now and it&#39;s only gotten worse. I struggle to find the &quot;perfect skin care routine&quot; I feel like I&#39;ve tried everything down to diet. People keep marketing their products and saying they cure acne. If I can stop trying to &quot;cure it&quot; and just love my skin I think I&#39;d be a lot happier. I just want to stop worrying about it. I know I&#39;m hygienic that should be enough.; jisoo and iu…. epitome of perfection; as a person in her early 20s I tell you, Don&#39;t try a lot of skincare. Just search moisturizer and sunscreen for your type of skin. I don&#39;t really have acne problems until I try a lot of skincare, just stick to the basic and wash your face regularly.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTswyuoEB80&amp;t=549"">9:09</a> 😅😅😅😅😅; Damn I really wanna date you<br>You’re smart and I’ll have someone to talk to; Edvasian, I just found your channel the other day. You make me smile, and your voice is very relaxing. Thank you ❤; Or an animal cosplay for running errands. Hahahahaha; Any foundation will cover imperfections if its applied half an inch thick,girl!; Glad to be a man who doesn&#39;t have to deal with this beauty standard. It makes the skin worse, must be annoying to have it on your face all day, it spreads onto clothes it touches, and really doesn&#39;t look all that great except in photos. I don&#39;t think most men would mind if women  used far less makeup.","The Beauty Standard That Doesn’t Exist – Perfect Skin Definitely check out Ana Luisa https://shop.analuisa.com/if-edvasian and get matching jewelry with your BFF because when you ... guys what if sephora set up an age limit; rxtt did; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTswyuoEB80&amp;t=153"">2:33</a> hard water and a razor; Thank you, I needed this video.

Idk.; Even when you are aware of how fake everything is, sometimes is hard to not get frustrated when you remember that the sking you&#39;ve been working so hard on, looks nothing like the glass skins online or kdramas; Its specially sad because you know all these celebs invest a lot of money in facials and skin care and, even if they have great skin, they/their teams still feel the need to edit the f out of their photos until they look like porcelain dolls; Much better hair and looks now...and if you could remove your colour contacts you&#39;ll look much better.; he has the perfect skin; Edvasios! Keep preaching, I love your personality!; We all come into this world with a physical form, and we have the right to exist in it as it is without shame.; The missing bellybutton got me. 😂; I love your videos, I have just discovered you.; I never had a problem with acne growing up so I wouldn’t know what to use..I don’t wear makeup..tinted sunscreen..the brightest red lipstick 💄 on special occasions..Since I was 16 years old I’ve used Noxzema and Neutrogena soap..I’m 59..and it’s still..in my opinion..the best to use..they cleanse and clean my face..things surely have changed..👍🏽continue to encourage young ones to be their youthful fresh face💎selves🫶🏽; it&#39;s the  everybody so creative for me <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a>; I remember seeing a person comment under a picture of a k-pop celebrity that was fairly old something like “they got so good genetics, they’re so perfect”. I replied with “remember that they use tons of filters and photoshop” but they just didn’t acknowledge it, they just continued to say that the celebrity is natural. It’s sad.; Skincare and makeup in the morning before putting on my glasses is like a real life filter 😂; All I want is a healthy normal skin like what my husband has. But I have to keep fighting acne every day and nothing is ever good enough. It already takes so much time, I can&#39;t imagine spending even more time in the bathroom doing makeup. I don&#39;t have 2 hours every day for this shit.; Also, I hate how people with acne are perceived as lazy. In my case, it&#39;s literally genetic and I have an active skincare routine, but my gene pool doesn&#39;t give a shit. I never had a say in my condition and can only ensure it does not deteriorate. (my father had acne till he turned 30); I kinda don&#39;t hate wrinkels though. Especially the ones you get from smiling. They show a person is happy in my opinion, or has a fun life. So I actually like seeing laugh lines.; I don&#39;t understand how people buy that celebrities are showing photos &quot;bare faced&quot; when you can clearly see that they&#39;re wearing a bunch of makeup 😂; The way u imitated mikayla ☠️ so accurate bye; fr tho skincare is so damn expensive and i&#39;m allergic to linalool (a component in lavender oil that everyone and their mom puts in every product) and I felt like an absolute moron for not having a skincare routine. Also It&#39;s kinda messed up how anti aging products demonize old age and wrinkles so much that as a college student I&#39;m expected to have an anti aging routine; Love your videos!; Thank you, after watching this material I realize my skin is sooo much better without any fancy product or filter. I&#39;m happy with what I have. &lt;3; Are you mixed Asian or something because yr too big for Asian so speak?; This guy comes off as a hater; I do retouching! We can separate out the texture of your skin and literally make your pores look perfect while blurring the tones underneath. <br><br>Don’t even get me STARTED on the hair retouching black magic. Trust me, nobody’s real hair is in any high end photo. I’ll even hand draw in parts that are too frizzy. It is totally insane how realistic this stuff can look now; Omg Michelle Phan ♡ The og; UNRELATED BUT U KINDA LOOK LIKE CHOERRY; My skin is damn near flawless most of the time (just in regard to pimples) - break outs during stress, but usually clear <br><br>My secret? Ed is completely right - do less. I use basic cheap facial wash (with 3% salicylic acid which is essentially aspirin) and occasionally moisturise with a cheap cocoa butter product or with some pure coconut oil - cheap from the health food section <br><br>Wearing makeup very very infrequently and avoiding the sun damage are the main things that I recommend to everyone who wants nice skin long term - sunscreen is always a better option than that $100 cream that is lying when it says it will undo that sun damage; My skin looks better in the mirror than on camera and now I&#39;m starting to look weird even with basic filters; Not just filters. Also the makeup layers these days are insane. Back in my day (i am 32) a cc cream was for weddings. We did not put on makeup everyday.; I&#39;m the water/ dish rag person and my skin has never looked better; She caked that powder on, and did she use painters tape for the line?; I get told I have perfect skin a /lot. / I never wear makeup, know my skin type, and take care of it. The end. I don&#39;t spend a lot of money on my skincare products either.; I have had bad acne on my cheeks for awhile. I&#39;m 22 now and it&#39;s only gotten worse. I struggle to find the &quot;perfect skin care routine&quot; I feel like I&#39;ve tried everything down to diet. People keep marketing their products and saying they cure acne. If I can stop trying to &quot;cure it&quot; and just love my skin I think I&#39;d be a lot happier. I just want to stop worrying about it. I know I&#39;m hygienic that should be enough.; jisoo and iu…. epitome of perfection; as a person in her early 20s I tell you, Don&#39;t try a lot of skincare. Just search moisturizer and sunscreen for your type of skin. I don&#39;t really have acne problems until I try a lot of skincare, just stick to the basic and wash your face regularly.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTswyuoEB80&amp;t=549"">9:09</a> 😅😅😅😅😅; Damn I really wanna date you<br>You’re smart and I’ll have someone to talk to; Edvasian, I just found your channel the other day. You make me smile, and your voice is very relaxing. Thank you ❤; Or an animal cosplay for running errands. Hahahahaha; Any foundation will cover imperfections if its applied half an inch thick,girl!; Glad to be a man who doesn&#39;t have to deal with this beauty standard. It makes the skin worse, must be annoying to have it on your face all day, it spreads onto clothes it touches, and really doesn&#39;t look all that great except in photos.

&quot;Thinspo&quot; in China Is Going Too Far | Gen 跟 China,VICE News,2022-04-28T16:00:31Z,The pressure to be thin is threatening the lives of some women in China. Being thin has always been a cultural beauty standard ...,e6KpA9QGAGQ,"Ah, being thin and attractive was one of the most important goals in my 20s. I&#39;m so glad i care much less about it now that i&#39;ve reached my 30s.; im 80 kg man and no adult weight who is not a dwarf should start with TWENTY. what the hell my little dog is heavier. i did not know a full grown human could be alive and weight so little. poor girls.; Focus is off, don&#39;t smoke not because it&#39;s ugly and taboo but because it&#39;s unhealthy.  Stay fit because it&#39;s healthy, and obesity kills.; Awesome👍🏼; The aftershocks of the colonizer and their influence. I&#39;ve noticed Asian countries worship the white man and want to look and be like them. This saddens me.; Htf did they get american belly at such a young age?; I want to lose weight i hate my body i have pcos and hyperprolactinemia and it makes it even more difficult; This is still better than American weird butt sizes which makes them look like alien 😂; As if Chinese women aren’t already insanely thin to begin with…… the global obsession with thinness needs to end….; This world is weird. The rich can choose not to eat, until its own self-destruction. The poor wants to eat but sometimes got nothing on the plate.; On average people are way to fat in the EU. Lets average it out.; I literally thought that the girl group they will be sharing is a famous one in china loved by all and not being called ugly.; Being healthy should be the beauty standard; Apparently Colona vilus affected their brains as well; I see thay you&#39;re wearing Havana rn Belgrado hoodie. Hope you had fun dancing in Belgrade!; They are heading towards the world of anorexic society. Mostly filter used for selfie. Not natural look. NOT A GOOD LOOK. UNHEALTHY AND SICKLY LOOKING. Eat and be happy and healthy.; Truly toxic culture; It&#39;s sad to see total strangers give their opinions on your body. 90% of them would never even come up to you and say anything to you face to face.<br><br>It&#39;s probably the biggest con of social media and the Internet in general. Bullying and low self esteem because of it. It&#39;s so widespread because people can hide through anonymity. Just this morning a guy commented on an Instagram picture asking for the username of a person in the photo and I gave it to him thinking I was being nice. He then proceeded to comment that most horrendous, disgusting things about me, all spread across 20 different comments, on my most recent Instagram post. The one that hurt the most was probably &quot;you&#39;ll never get a man because you are fat, ugly and disgusting goblin who causes earthquakes everytime you walk. Go eat a salad. Torta torta torta&quot; along with some other stuff I can&#39;t comment here. I deleted them all but it did cause me to cry for a good 20 minutes.; Fat westerners making fun of Asians for being skinny? <br>Maybe you should make fun of rich people for having more money than you do next; the thing is - if you keep the people occupied with ridiculous beauty standards, they willl not have any energy left to realize the unjustice and inhumane conditions they are living under. Working 6 days a week from 9am to 9pm was normal until covid; if women are made fun of for their looks and praised for being child-like, they will never put any effort into education and emancipation/feminism.; Sollen sie  sich runter hungern. Hauptsache sie essen keine Hunde und Katzen; Ok but the woman who moved to new york - that’s so far from fat, just look at the uk or USA…; They should be importing a whole lotta brothers who likes em  thicc! 😂; Being a woman is exhausting; F; This made me tear up. As someone with an ED and seeing all these pretty and strong girls dealing with the same subject it really gives me hope and strenght ❤️ you Girls Are awesome thank you!; trying on kids cloth sounds.. icky; Cindy is so beautiful though I dont understand why they thought she was ugly it doesnt make sense; From foot bending to kids bullshit to this kind of bullcrap wtf; China is pushing it to the extreme but, in all, fairness, the obsession and focus on the body’s aesthetics beyond what is healthy, in whatever direction, is a tale as old as humanity, it’ll never disappear. <br>I was headed down that route as well, my saving grace was competitive running. <br>I’m not saying that it’s the perfect solution but it completely changed my relationship to my body. Now, my body and I have to work together to perform well, I cannot afford to starve myself or neglect my body’s needs or else I’ll notice it with a drop in performance right away. Aesthetics became sort of an afterthought. My body is my own little machine that works hard, and only well oiled machines work well.; how could anyone say that girl group was ugly? my jaw dropped because of how pretty they looked especially with the fun makeup they did. saying something like that to a kid isnt right; Girls you are all exceptionally beautiful no matter how many kilos you weigh! I pray that beauty standards will change and this misery will end! Help us dear Jesus Christ❤; Eating issues can also be due to depression or stress not just due to body image issues or other things, please remember that. <br>Support people and love them, don’t abandon them or shun them; At least they still know what a woman is.; Meanwhile we have the complete opposite in the US, with people pushing 1000 pounds.; Not just china korea and japan to I mean whats up with those people are they loosing there minds or what; Why do you normalize being fat? Just be normal; I suffered from anorexia and actually went to China as an exchange student during my anorexia... I was roughly 73 ibs and people were taking pictures of me and calling me a model... I was dying but it was the beauty standard. I still struggle with accepting my body, I see so many thinspo influencers on TikTok and it gets to be so frustrating to maintain my healthy weight. I&#39;m so glad she&#39;s ok now and I hope she&#39;s still doing well. I see a new surge in thinspo online and Kpop idol dieting rituals too. Sometimes I have to just stay off of the internet...; anorexia. Asian women are not developed like kids so they appeal to pedophiles.; I remember when I was in high school, lots of girls were super conscious about body image. I was one of these girls. If you know about Chinese high school education, we had very very very limited time to exercise and we basically sat on the chair all day to study. So if you want to lose weight, the only way to do it is to starve yourself. For a whole semester, I only had breakfast which was a sandwich and a box of watermelon brought to school. I am six feet tall and about 70kg. So obviously that was not enough calories for me. I often felt dizzy, especially when I got down and then got up, it almost felt like I was going to fall down. My period stopped for a long time, even after this crazy diet. And I was not the craziest case. I heard from a friend of mine from another class. She said one girl in her class only drank brown sugar water and took vitamins for a whole month. She lost about 9kg in a month. I don&#39;t know if this was entirely true and if she stuck to this crazy &quot;diet&quot; all along. But you can see how insane the situation was. Also, I was super insecure about the way I looked. We could only wear school uniforms on weekdays. The school uniforms are ugly but they are very loose which were in some way friendly for teenagers with body image insecurities. But on weekends, we were allowed to wear our own outfits (Yes, we went to school on weekends). I was very insecure about my huge thighs. I didn&#39;t wear tight pants and I had to wear longer tops to cover the upper part of my thighs. One time I was wearing a pair of already quite loose jeans. But I got mocked by one of my friends at the time for my huge thighs. Now I realize how toxic is this skinny culture is. I have been working out, doing strength training and cardio for five months with a regular planned diet. I really wish young girls could start to realize health is the most important and to embrace yourself no matter how you look. But seeing the social media nowadays, I feel there is still a long way to go....; Social media, where you can share all the malinformation and spread the bad messaging on imaging. Sad; thin with big melons is hot 😍; It feels like the more I try to recover the more pressure there is to be thin; As a skinny girl who doesn&#39;t starve herself but was born like that, am happy about this video. My mom passed away last year at just 44 due to a rare condition that caused her to lose weight but i never looked at her differently except some people including relatives who never tried to understand that she was going through a lot 😢; People who ask about our weight are the reasons why some people are going crazy 😢; Honestly... this is better than what is going on in America; Strange obsession with thin vs healthy and fit.; uhm if someone ask me how much I weight that is a critical offense in my country lol, also saying to a stranger to lose weight is literally asking for a hit; “i think loving yourself is acceptance. loving yourself doesn’t mean that you give yourself a hundred marks”<br>there have been no truer words said👍🏽; I&#39;m not exactly sure if Social Media plays a Role in this Or is it just a Lack Of Confidence in one&#39;s Self!! Being Thin doesn&#39;t make you Better than anyone it just makes you Smaller than the Average Person!! I&#39;m not sure Why certain countries put so much Pressure on a woman&#39;s looks her body her Makeup 💄!! At some point 👉🏽 you gotta say Enough Is Enough!! Like it Or Love it I&#39;m Going To Be Myself and If that Pill 💊 is to Big For Some Of You to Swallow Then Oh Well😮!! I&#39;m an American Black 🖤 Woman and I&#39;m Curvy All Over!! I love my body and have never had A Guy To Complain About It Yet!! Ladies Love Yourself 😍 Always!! Best of luck to you all💚🤍🍀🤍💚; Opposite to America 😂; I‘m from a country in europe and the skinniness of east asien countries affect a lot of young girls. It is about trends but mostly dangerous are K-pop idols and their diets. I am friends with at least four fifteen year old girls who weigh around 43 kilograms. They talk for example about the ‘perfect K-pop idol weight’ which is your height minus 125. I am scared of it and there are probably a lot more girls like that. Sometimes they never eat breakfast and often no lunch or dinner. It is so dangerous.; i think im going to korea and eat a big bucket of kfc chicken in front of everyone; sexy<br>deep-seated....really Vice; Not far enough; I see no problem here, better then the problem we&#39;re facing in America.....; Glad I stopped falling for white supremacist beauty standards🙄Just reached 250 pounds 🙏 God is good 🇺🇸; I mean I&#39;ll rather die skinny than being obese; Well, it&#39;s kinda relieving to see that social media is not only fucking up western societies.; stop crying, thin is good, fat is bad, simples as that, if the woman are fragile and week in mind to be so extreme, that&#39;s they problem.; Cause they are all f’d in the head 😂; While in the US, big butts are considered sexy....; Their standards are plain toxic and unhealthy. You can blatantly see it among their actresses. I understand wanting fair, clear skin but being praised for having a 58cm waist as a 30-something year-old woman? I&#39;m a petite 29 yo Malay lady and the smallest my waistline can go is 61-62cm, and that&#39;s usually on days I don&#39;t get bloated or bogged down by water retention.; I think it’s ok to want to lose weight, tone your body, and set other fitness goals, even if you are at a healthy weight. The girl who was working out in this video looks perfectly healthy to me even after her weight-loss and seems as though she feels more confident. <br>I think the issue comes in when someone takes it too far. It’s all about balance.; I&#39;m on an asian dating site and most of the chinese girls are pale and pasty and look plastic. Horrible. I prefer a girl with a skin tone.; We have a weight spectrum between China and the U.S. The women in China are on the extremely anorexic side while women in the U.S. are on the extremely fat af side.; well, I guess im going to get a 85 pound Asian cat girl to marry me after all.; I like women with skinny waist, but it doesn&#39;t mean she has to be skin and bones. This is madness. My ex was 63k 168cm and she was skinny. Slim figure. For Asian standards she would be &quot;Big&quot; because of her weight, but in reality she was slim. Literally no fat on her belly.; Skinny is always better; If they’re fat, then I’m a gluttonous beast; &quot;you could always be thinner...look better&quot;; At least it isn’t mass obesity; I love skinny asian women with huge tits. Don&#39;t love skeletons though.; Chairman Mao would not have approved; My wife is 54 and still weighs the same as when we got married 34 years ago at 125lbs. It’s all about what you eat and portion size or amount you eat. Each meal size in total should be as big as your fist. It’ll take a while until your brain and stomach adjust to the proper size again. Also eat jello and apples if you want a quick snack but again, don’t go nuts with the jello.; I go around saying I have always been thin because in the USA I have always been technically underweight but I suppose in China I would be considered fat? That&#39;s wild.; Chinese people are bored; Кееp eating fried food and expect not to be fat lol :D; The girl group being called ugly was wild. They’re all pretty. They’re thin by American standards.; Well, CCP has to make it normalized to have a bone thin population as they starve. It&#39;s not a trend. it&#39;s a reality check to France.; Good; i was living in china 5 years, they eat a lot and still thin coz of genetics!; theyre all pretty when theyre healthy beauty is NOT thiness; In New Zealand I wear size xxs clothing and weigh 56kg, I’m healthy but definitely considered skinny. But based on this video it seems in China I would be considered fat. I’m already wearing the smallest clothing size for women and can fit into kid’s sizes in New Zealand, all these super skinny Chinese ladies wouldn’t be able to find any clothes here. I’ve seen Chinese girls who live in New Zealand and they’re swimming in all their clothes because the smallest size is too big for them. It’s crazy to think that in one country you’re so skinny it’s difficult to find clothes that fit and then in another you’re considered fat. I have an hourglass body shape with literally ginormous thighs so I just know they’d consider me obese.; Still far healthier than western culture pushing &quot;Fat Acceptance&quot; aka &quot;Body Positivity&quot; whatever. <br>     As calorie restriction has been shown to improve health, and increase longevity. Proven facts.. <br>      Meanwhile, being overweight or obese destroys health, impacts quality of life, and cuts lives short...; The most normal athletic looking woman &quot; is fat&quot; for them lol this is so sad.; What do people expect? At least among men in the West the underaged-body is the &quot;ideal female body&quot;, at least when it comes to Asian women, of whom they fetishize for being &quot;submissive, small, easy to beat and control&quot;. Men who are attracted to Asian women, at least in the West, want the super tiny female body because they want literal children.; Go live on the peasant farm.  Wish granted!; I’ve never been able to gain weight. I get told I’m skinny and I don’t like it. I wish I was more curvy.

Bullying and low self esteem because of it. It&#39;s so widespread because people can hide through anonymity. Just this morning a guy commented on an Instagram picture asking for the username of a person in the photo and I gave it to him thinking I was being nice. He then proceeded to comment that most horrendous, disgusting things about me, all spread across 20 different comments, on my most recent Instagram post. The one that hurt the most was probably &quot;you&#39;ll never get a man because you are fat, ugly and disgusting goblin who causes earthquakes everytime you walk. Go eat a salad. Torta torta torta&quot; along with some other stuff I can&#39;t comment here.

Now, my body and I have to work together to perform well, I cannot afford to starve myself or neglect my body’s needs or else I’ll notice it with a drop in performance right away. Aesthetics became sort of an afterthought.

Just be normal; I suffered from anorexia and actually went to China as an exchange student during my anorexia... I was roughly 73 ibs and people were taking pictures of me and calling me a model... I was dying but it was the beauty standard. I still struggle with accepting my body, I see so many thinspo influencers on TikTok and it gets to be so frustrating to maintain my healthy weight. I&#39;m so glad she&#39;s ok now and I hope she&#39;s still doing well. I see a new surge in thinspo online and Kpop idol dieting rituals too. Sometimes I have to just stay off of the internet...; anorexia. Asian women are not developed like kids so they appeal to pedophiles.; I remember when I was in high school, lots of girls were super conscious about body image. I was one of these girls. If you know about Chinese high school education, we had very very very limited time to exercise and we basically sat on the chair all day to study. So if you want to lose weight, the only way to do it is to starve yourself. For a whole semester, I only had breakfast which was a sandwich and a box of watermelon brought to school. I am six feet tall and about 70kg. So obviously that was not enough calories for me. I often felt dizzy, especially when I got down and then got up, it almost felt like I was going to fall down. My period stopped for a long time, even after this crazy diet. And I was not the craziest case. I heard from a friend of mine from another class. She said one girl in her class only drank brown sugar water and took vitamins for a whole month. She lost about 9kg in a month. I don&#39;t know if this was entirely true and if she stuck to this crazy &quot;diet&quot; all along. But you can see how insane the situation was. Also, I was super insecure about the way I looked. We could only wear school uniforms on weekdays. The school uniforms are ugly but they are very loose which were in some way friendly for teenagers with body image insecurities. But on weekends, we were allowed to wear our own outfits (Yes, we went to school on weekends). I was very insecure about my huge thighs. I didn&#39;t wear tight pants and I had to wear longer tops to cover the upper part of my thighs. One time I was wearing a pair of already quite loose jeans. But I got mocked by one of my friends at the time for my huge thighs. Now I realize how toxic is this skinny culture is. I have been working out, doing strength training and cardio for five months with a regular planned diet. I really wish young girls could start to realize health is the most important and to embrace yourself no matter how you look. But seeing the social media nowadays, I feel there is still a long way to go....; Social media, where you can share all the malinformation and spread the bad messaging on imaging. Sad; thin with big melons is hot 😍; It feels like the more I try to recover the more pressure there is to be thin; As a skinny girl who doesn&#39;t starve herself but was born like that, am happy about this video. My mom passed away last year at just 44 due to a rare condition that caused her to lose weight but i never looked at her differently except some people including relatives who never tried to understand that she was going through a lot 😢; People who ask about our weight are the reasons why some people are going crazy 😢; Honestly... this is better than what is going on in America; Strange obsession with thin vs healthy and fit.; uhm if someone ask me how much I weight that is a critical offense in my country lol, also saying to a stranger to lose weight is literally asking for a hit; “i think loving yourself is acceptance. loving yourself doesn’t mean that you give yourself a hundred marks”<br>there have been no truer words said👍🏽; I&#39;m not exactly sure if Social Media plays a Role in this Or is it just a Lack Of Confidence in one&#39;s Self!!

Best of luck to you all💚🤍🍀🤍💚; Opposite to America 😂; I‘m from a country in europe and the skinniness of east asien countries affect a lot of young girls. It is about trends but mostly dangerous are K-pop idols and their diets. I am friends with at least four fifteen year old girls who weigh around 43 kilograms. They talk for example about the ‘perfect K-pop idol weight’ which is your height minus 125. I am scared of it and there are probably a lot more girls like that. Sometimes they never eat breakfast and often no lunch or dinner. It is so dangerous.; i think im going to korea and eat a big bucket of kfc chicken in front of everyone; sexy<br>deep-seated....really Vice; Not far enough; I see no problem here, better then the problem we&#39;re facing in America.....; Glad I stopped falling for white supremacist beauty standards🙄Just reached 250 pounds 🙏 God is good 🇺🇸; I mean I&#39;ll rather die skinny than being obese; Well, it&#39;s kinda relieving to see that social media is not only fucking up western societies.; stop crying, thin is good, fat is bad, simples as that, if the woman are fragile and week in mind to be so extreme, that&#39;s they problem.; Cause they are all f’d in the head 😂; While in the US, big butts are considered sexy....; Their standards are plain toxic and unhealthy. You can blatantly see it among their actresses. I understand wanting fair, clear skin but being praised for having a 58cm waist as a 30-something year-old woman? I&#39;m a petite 29 yo Malay lady and the smallest my waistline can go is 61-62cm, and that&#39;s usually on days I don&#39;t get bloated or bogged down by water retention.; I think it’s ok to want to lose weight, tone your body, and set other fitness goals, even if you are at a healthy weight. The girl who was working out in this video looks perfectly healthy to me even after her weight-loss and seems as though she feels more confident. <br>I think the issue comes in when someone takes it too far. It’s all about balance.; I&#39;m on an asian dating site and most of the chinese girls are pale and pasty and look plastic. Horrible.

This is madness. My ex was 63k 168cm and she was skinny. Slim figure. For Asian standards she would be &quot;Big&quot; because of her weight, but in reality she was slim. Literally no fat on her belly.; Skinny is always better; If they’re fat, then I’m a gluttonous beast; &quot;you could always be thinner...look better&quot;; At least it isn’t mass obesity; I love skinny asian women with huge tits.

But based on this video it seems in China I would be considered fat. I’m already wearing the smallest clothing size for women and can fit into kid’s sizes in New Zealand, all these super skinny Chinese ladies wouldn’t be able to find any clothes here. I’ve seen Chinese girls who live in New Zealand and they’re swimming in all their clothes because the smallest size is too big for them. It’s crazy to think that in one country you’re so skinny it’s difficult to find clothes that fit and then in another you’re considered fat. I have an hourglass body shape with literally ginormous thighs so I just know they’d consider me obese.; Still far healthier than western culture pushing &quot;Fat Acceptance&quot; aka &quot;Body Positivity&quot; whatever. <br>     As calorie restriction has been shown to improve health, and increase longevity.

Shes beautiful! ❤; 😢; I understand the current trend of saying every woman is beautiful, but I think it is the wrong approach. Instead, I think we need to stop focusing on physical appearance altogether. A person&#39;s worth--even a beautiful person&#39;s worth--should not be determined by their physical appearance. Instead, people should be judged (yes, judged; there&#39;s no getting around that) by their behavior towards others.; Anyone trying to get purely cosmetic surgery on her 8-year-old needs to lose custody of that child. I&#39;m a European-type North American, and I think Asian eyes are lovely and exotic.; You can go for facial or take care your complexion ,but not plastic surgery❤❤❤; Healthy is most  important than everything.plastic surgery needs to inject and a lot of toxin in your body; Affrim your childs appearance and they wont have problems with the look.; My monolid eyes became double eye lids as I get older. Possibly the skin got loose.; I live in Asia and most ads or photos on products are of very white, caucasianized Asian and white children with blond hair and blue eyes. I feel embarrassed and sorry as a white blond blue eyed woman.; I wonder if it goes the other way. If you feel closer to one side of your ethnicity (whether that’s Asian, black or whatever) but you LOOK very Caucasian, you may be interested in shifting your look the OTHER way. Why people aren’t interested in this is a mystery.; There are ugly monolid eyes and beautiful monolid eyes. It depends on the person&#39;s overall appearance. Some people really need it because their eyes are too small and does not fit with the other features.  Flat noses are ugly on all people and all races as well as big monstrous witch nose that are commonly seen with Arab, Indian and Europeans.  I don&#39;t know why Asians are being called out when Caucasians do the same thing. Beautiful is Beautiful regardless of race.  To be seen beautiful is to have features that are even and not odd looking.; I don&#39;t know why but I tend to think Dr Youn is correct. And it saddens me because as a Caucasian women I always admire the Asian women for their natural beauty. No disrespect to any Plastic Surgeons but I don&#39;t think surgery should be done if it isn&#39;t for accidents and deformities, and if a woman or a man really feel uncomfortable with something  and it affects self esteem then fix that but don&#39;t try to defy aging. Age gracefully.<br>When I was young I was teased so much for my thin longer nose and always said I will get my nose reduced. I love the Asians wider less bony noses. But as I aged I made peace with it. And I think it&#39;s important to just be what our creator intended us to me.<br>The beauty of a women lies in her soul and the love that she shares. <br>Asian ladies be proud of who you are and what makes you unique. And Dr Youn I have the utmost respect for your ethical standards and bringing up these issues. Be blessed 🙏💛; Pp stop being ungrateful to the way you are. Stop doing this bizarre procedures. You are created like with these types of eyes for a reason.; Dr. Youn, you&#39;re a plastic surgeon because you believe in helping people improve their looks.  People should go for it if they want to.  Why not?!; Unrelated but I noticed that many Asians who naturally have “pointy” noses tend to have it expressed in aquiline like manner and it’s due to their low nasal radix. You can see this in old paintings too.; You are talking truth Dr. Youn! <br>감사합니다 !; the constant colonization of asians is exhausting eg land then bodies.

That&#39;s just so fitting..; My parents are Mexican and moved the family to Mexico when I was a toddler. I grew up surrounded by  Mexican people only, but  saw Asian people on TV. I always wished I looked like them. I would find ways to pull my eyes to the sides to look Asian. I longed for straight beautiful hair instead of my long curly hair, and wanted to change my name to Kim or anything Asian. Eventually,  I learned to love me for who I am physically, but it wasn&#39;t easy.  Like you, I wish Asian women (and men) realized how naturally beautiful they are, but also understand them desiring to be different like I did.; I think that typically Asian eyes are very beautiful (I would easily keep them if I was born that way; but I have classic eyes with a nose like a small pom-pom = I am from the Czech Republic, i.e. of Slavic nationality). I don&#39;t understand why often very pretty Asian women want to look more like European women. In many cases, they are the most beautiful women in the world and do not need such operations at all!🤔🤗; Thank you Dr. Youn. I hope we can bring more awareness to the Asian community. How do we educate society to accept imperfections? How do educate people that looks is not everything?  I wish there’s something I can do about this.; So why are you a plastic surgeon if its all phony in the first place........Money?; Im so tired of everyone in the world having a thin, pointy nose. I like watching European and Asian movies better nowadays because there is so much more variety in looks, ages, and personalities than the homigenized standard American media has pushed.; I love this video of yours. I wish there were more people advocating the same.; So true the modern beauty standards for Asian women are totally whitewashed. Thank you for the video bring up the awareness.; The whole world has been brainwashed and colonised by one race, and they carry on doing do.; My Father always was self conscious about his ears and had them set back. Asian eyelids are beautiful. I always wished I had almond eyes...We are all really beautiful just the way God made us.; I’m happy I was raised in a way where I was exposed to all kinds of people (Even being born in a very very white looking town, nothing bad about it, just stating the obvious.) The way I think of beauty is beauty is whatever I think looks pretty. Has nothing to do with specific features, but if they come together in a way that I think looks good, they’re beautiful. And even If I don’t think certain individuals are conventionally attractive, they still have interesting things about the way they look that I can admire.; Hello. Can I ask you a question and answer me honestly? Are these beauty practices good or bad? Does it have complications? Does it hurt? I have decided to do plastic surgery in Korea, but I want to do a lot of research before that.<br>Thanks 😊; Words of wisdom! Dr Youn, the people&#39;s champion!; Wow, I really appreciate this video!  I&#39;m white but my lids are flat and I have always felt a bit less than.; I live at the moment in thailand. 90 percent of thai people do hsve double eyelids but their eyes are not ss beautiful as caucasian because their diuble eyelids still hsve eoucanthald folds and short eyelashes. To be honest the only thai person with beautiful riunded eyes and no epicanthal folds thst i have seen. 100 percent of them are Muslim Thais that look like have some arab or indian admixture. The lesa of pure Thai have double eyelids with epicanthal folds.; I am Korean.  Grew up with monolids, but strangely as I grew older my eyes grew to have double eyelids.  How did this happen?  I did not have any surgery done.; Really sad if they are getting eye surgery to be accepted to Caucasians, I always thought that is what they liked.  It’s really sad because they are beautiful as they are, I wish they could see it.; Asian eyes are attractive if it’s combined w low set brows; Aww, this is sad. And confusing ... I always thought monolids were attractive despite not having them myself. And I really, really appreciate Dr Youn&#39;s stance on this though. The story about his daughter is totally relatable. Our babies are beautiful to us and they deserve to grow up and see themselves as we see them.; People of color need to let go of white beauty standards. We are beautiful.; ...; I personally think Asian features are unique and beautiful its sad to think people would want to change it. I would never want to trade my african american features; Wow this is so interesting; i remember two decades ago when i graduated from college, and a half Korean female classmate said for her graduation, her Korean mother is willing to pay for her plastic surgery as a graduation gift. I was floored to hear that, confuse why considering that she was pretty or the fact it&#39;s actually a graduation gift; monolids are beautiful, wish i had them!; shows how powerful western culture is, nobody tells others to emu.ate they just do. Similar to brunette hirls in USA tring to look like Kim K? hard to discipher why....; Oh yeah...I agree that having mixed races having kids is like you never know what you going to get at birth of child. Its absolutely awesome, such a surprise to see how they turn out...they are not a carbon copy of you or hubby they are their own individual mix of uniqueness and when they have blonde, brunette or auburn hair and blue, green, amber or brown eye colours its just so wonderful to see the mix and match going on.  One of my children had monolids with blue eyes, white skin and auburn hair.  They are all beautiful in their own way.  Fashion is changing and with more ethnicities getting their share of the limelight on social media...blue eyed blondes might be out and dark tones of every hue will be the IN thing.; We love these videos;  Dr. Youn seems to have a need to  see his patients&#39;  HAPPINESS in ones own SKIN. rather than becoming beautiful to please society! <br>&quot;Beauty&quot; to please society!MUSIC being the &quot;universal language&quot;, it breaks MY heart to see FEMALES who work as musicians SAYING to be successful, they have to have the but lift and a boob job!

I love East Asian faces. They are gorgeous period.; Ninguém está satisfeito com sua aparência étnica porque entenda é Capitalismo, como a indústria cosmética e cirurgias plásticas iriam te vender coisas que você não precisa se você gostasse da própria aparência? 🤷🏻‍♀️ É por isto que o nariz perfeito só é alcançando com rinoplastia, não importa qual seja a sua étnia. Da mesma forma são diversos aspectos da aparência e da sua vida, de novo não é pessoal é só Capitalismo, puro e simples Capitalismo. Isto me lembra das famosas brasileiras que sofrem bullying por tamanho de testa, não sofre étnias, é sobre estar insatisfeito e ter uma indústria para te vender algo para aliviar sua insatisfação. Uma peruca para seu cabelo, um mega hair para o volume de cabelo, tinta de cabelo, espartilhos, bundex, sutiã com enchimento, sapatos com salto, sapatos que escondem o tamanho do seu pé, bronzeamento falso, lentes de contato… Viu? Uma indústria que lucra com a sua insatisfação, mas não faz diferença da sua etnia, só do seu bolso.; Why do humans want what others want? Be proud of your uniqueness; Im with you  Dr Youn; Thank you for posting this! 🥲🫶everyday I struggle with my appearance, and I’m always thinking when I go to Korea, I’ll get my eyes and nose done! However, when I travelled to Taiwan last year, it was the first time I felt beautiful, because I saw billboards of models with Chinese noses like mines. It was an empowering feeling knowing that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and living in America as an Asian is difficult, in the sense of beauty standards. Thank you again for this reminder that beauty is not just European based.; When I had a brain surgery my Bell’s palsy got noticeably worse and I was having trouble with eye lashes going inverted, constantly irritating eyes so I had gone to eye surgeon about correction. He suggested that this would be a great time to have double eyelids, and correct the inverted eyelashes. I told him that I want to keep my eyes as I came into this world and die with it. He agreed to kept it as is and transplant skin from inside my mouth to inserting it top eyelids. I can see the scars but I don’t regret about keeping it as I was born and I’m glad that I don’t look like everyone else.; Asian features are beautiful,  I hate that they want to change them to look more American. The most beautiful person is the one you are meant to be, not who you can afford to look like; I strongly disagree with many of the comments that seem to say Asians only have monolids. That is implying that our looks are monolothic (haha, like what I did there?). In any case, please do not paint all Asians with a broad phenotypic brush. Many Asians naturally have double eyelids and/or tall noses. These are not &quot;European&quot; features. These are features that are found in multiple ethnicities. Almost my whole family have either double eyelids or high nose bridges or both! Many of my friends as well. And yes, we are natural. <br>When people try to make us monolothic, it wipes away our individuality!; Your little bit wrong not all asian country do many country people they like themselves india, nepal, sri Lanka ,Bangladesh ,bhutan ...; I think assuming asian (eg Korean) beauty standards are geared towards european looks is eurocentric in itself. <br>In my opinion Western and eastern beauty standards are not alike. Eastern ideals are about youthfulness, cutenes. Its more about (European) dolls than actually wanting to look &quot;white&quot;. And sure as hell not kardashian sexy.; When I had my eyelids done I asked the surgeon to put extra stitches on the outer corners of my eyes to make them more “Asian”. I guess the grass is always greener!; I truly think monolids are so much more beautiful than “double eyelids”. Everyone is different, and monolids are a crucial east Asian feature that is a part of what makes the culture so special and the people more beautiful. People’s “eye smiles” just aren’t the same with double eyelids. What I wouldn’t give for mysterious, cat-like, exotic eyes like that! If they had “monolid surgery” I’d seriously consider it if it didn’t mean I wouldn’t look like my parents anymore.; What happens when they have children and they come out with all their old features? Will they push their children to have surgery to match their own looks?; I see how West-centered power work to change how other race to judge things and see themselves, their aesthetic sense and standard.... every thing defined by the West.  Isn&#39;t  it cultural genocide in its finest?; I&#39;m not White but I look Caucasian thankfully. 😌 It is a blessing to look White.; The world is going cray!! Those “mono lids” are the prettiest features ever, just beautiful like a petal ❤❤❤❤❤ its asian for me lol ❤❤😂😅❤; 8 yrs old crazy mom 😮; Thank you for taking this stance. As a monolid Asian woman, I too went through many years of criticism and judgement in my younger days before I learnt to love and embrace my asian features.  I only wish many more plastic surgeons share your convictions and take the same stance to encourage woman, or men, to embrace their natural looks and not conform to social standards of beauty. After all we are all made in the image of God.; Excellent video. I could&#39;t agree more. I always found Asian men and women attractive and beautiful.; Same for breast size....we should see the beauty in all different shapes and sizes of breasts....Monolids?  Small Breasts?  Wide nose?  <br>Accept what God gave you.; I will never understand the need for plastic surgery, unless you have a real deformity due to an accident etc. Nobody does it for themselves, everyone does it for others. After all, you dont see yourself, you only see your effect on others. Frankly, I don&#39;t care that much about other people. I would never get surgery to please them. They can think whatever the hell they want, I couldn&#39;t be bothered. If they don&#39;t like what they see, they can go look at someone else. If someone doesn&#39;t love you without good looks, they will not love you with good looks, they will only love the good looks. They would not be loving you, ever. What kind of insane person are you to get surgery to please someone who guaranteed doesn&#39;t love you?; If you are Asian, you are beautiful!!!! I don’t understand the weird fads. I hope the pendulum swings in the other direction soon.; I am European an I remember in my childhood that I liked monolids to look like Mulan. Haha... <br>Thank you to not support racist plastic surgeries; I understand that plastic surgery for medical condition is necessary.  However for people&#39;s choice,  it&#39;s n9t good.  Imagine the mom looks so beautiful after surgery but all the kids look nothing like the mom.😢; the music is too laud; Wonderful video with a wonderful message for young women to accept themselves for who they are.

Im talking Micheal jackson. 🕺; The surprise is that even though the women get this surgery and the husband feels she is more beautiful or even she feels that way, when they have babies these features are genetic and the babies will have a mixture of all of them.  That is something that when men marry women for beauty they do not always know where and when the features they like the best came into effect.  when they have babies and are surprised when they do not look like the mother because the mother does not look like she originally did.  Its all a mess.  I guess if they feel it will make them look better what is the harm but when done in abundance it becomes a trend and people no longer appreciate what makes them unique.  It is sad, I have to admit I would like to refreshen a bit but not drastically change my appearance.  Some of the patients look like someone else completely.; I’m the only one in my family with monolid eyes, but I never minded or was bothered by it.  I’m slightly bug-eyed so they look larger and have a fake crease to them.  I just find it easier to apply eyeshadow.; I&#39;m travelling around Indonesia and Thailand and I was having dinner with locals. I have been watching a lot of these videos and generally following fashion trends. I made a comment to my new Thai friend stating that there has been a big influx in fillers from where I&#39;m from and that mostly white people get their lips done, breasts, BBLs and I think we should ease up on it. I also commented that I didn&#39;t like the double eyelid surgery because it takes away from the beauty of Asian ethnicity and same as the white people who don&#39;t want to look their race and opt for bigger lips and features that are uncommon in being white. She got so defensive and said &#39;What if it really bothers someone?&quot; I said I understood but I almost feel like it&#39;s a necessity now and I grew up poor so I feel for the kids who grew up like me having to pay all that money (and it&#39;s thousands of dollars) and being pressured into a social trend. It didn&#39;t end well. I think she told the other girls what I said and maybe some of them had the surgery, I honestly wasn&#39;t trying to be offensive and all the girls were stunning. In short, it is absolutely massive here. I can&#39;t tell whether it is good genes or the procedures but everyone&#39;s skin looks flawless and there is a lot of pressure on women and it is expensive. I can&#39;t imagine what S Korea would be like; Your mololids are beautiful just like your personality doctor 😍; i wanted the non stinky asian armpits gene😅; We always want what we don&#39;t have. I don&#39;t like having big blue eyes and curly light hair. I look like a barbie-hocky mom. I always thought asians and hooded eyes look so sexy...I was envious of their look and awesome hair.

I&#39;d loooove to be darker, like much darker. lol; In the Philippines, people with dark skin are being made fun of. This is because the media and beauty pageants usually favor biracial Filipinos, making them use Filipino-sounding names for the people to think that &quot;This is what a beautiful Filipino looks like.&quot; They even had shows where there&#39;s a bullied main character because her skin was dark and had a wide nose, then she either magically changed or got a makeover into this mestiza. And yeah, everyone has whitening creams, soaps, pills, IVs, and rhinoplasty is the no. 1 procedure.; I started watching Asian movies and TV series awhile back and I became struck by how much alike all the female leads seemed to look. Then I became aware of the extensive plastic surgery undergone by so many of them. I know the same obsession with appearance is prevalent in the U.S. and I think it&#39;s sad. I&#39;m a senior citizen and so aware that any surgery is risky and to undergo procedures to change one&#39;s appearance is scary. So much can go wrong and the results are forever.; I don&#39;t know, sometimes you want something done because you like the benefits and the look it has. Not necessarily because you are trying to be a different race. Certain eyeliner and looks look better with one type of eye.  Better on almond eyes than round for example and maybe that&#39;s just the look one is trying to achieve.; Dr. Youn don&#39;t say the doctor felt if they received eyelid surgery to be excepted by Americans.

Every time we meet, the first thing she comments on is... I&#39;ve gained weight, I&#39;m blacker and my face is blotchy.gosh!and it makes me very afraid to meet her. sometimes I say to her.. you gave birth to me .. isn&#39;t it your responsibility if you think I&#39;m not perfect? 😂😂😂😂; Not very similar, but my parents used to mock me starting around 5 years old for not being masculine enough, so when kids on the playground started saying it, i had no reason to defend myself, and was happening to me at school and at home.

Shes beautiful! ❤; 😢; I understand the current trend of saying every woman is beautiful, but I think it is the wrong approach. Instead, I think we need to stop focusing on physical appearance altogether. A person&#39;s worth--even a beautiful person&#39;s worth--should not be determined by their physical appearance. Instead, people should be judged (yes, judged; there&#39;s no getting around that) by their behavior towards others.; Anyone trying to get purely cosmetic surgery on her 8-year-old needs to lose custody of that child.

Why people aren’t interested in this is a mystery.; There are ugly monolid eyes and beautiful monolid eyes. It depends on the person&#39;s overall appearance. Some people really need it because their eyes are too small and does not fit with the other features.  Flat noses are ugly on all people and all races as well as big monstrous witch nose that are commonly seen with Arab, Indian and Europeans.  I don&#39;t know why Asians are being called out when Caucasians do the same thing. Beautiful is Beautiful regardless of race.  To be seen beautiful is to have features that are even and not odd looking.; I don&#39;t know why but I tend to think Dr Youn is correct. And it saddens me because as a Caucasian women I always admire the Asian women for their natural beauty. No disrespect to any Plastic Surgeons but I don&#39;t think surgery should be done if it isn&#39;t for accidents and deformities, and if a woman or a man really feel uncomfortable with something  and it affects self esteem then fix that but don&#39;t try to defy aging. Age gracefully.<br>When I was young I was teased so much for my thin longer nose and always said I will get my nose reduced. I love the Asians wider less bony noses.

That&#39;s just so fitting..; My parents are Mexican and moved the family to Mexico when I was a toddler. I grew up surrounded by  Mexican people only, but  saw Asian people on TV. I always wished I looked like them. I would find ways to pull my eyes to the sides to look Asian. I longed for straight beautiful hair instead of my long curly hair, and wanted to change my name to Kim or anything Asian. Eventually,  I learned to love me for who I am physically, but it wasn&#39;t easy.  Like you, I wish Asian women (and men) realized how naturally beautiful they are, but also understand them desiring to be different like I did.; I think that typically Asian eyes are very beautiful (I would easily keep them if I was born that way; but I have classic eyes with a nose like a small pom-pom = I am from the Czech Republic, i.e. of Slavic nationality). I don&#39;t understand why often very pretty Asian women want to look more like European women. In many cases, they are the most beautiful women in the world and do not need such operations at all!🤔🤗; Thank you Dr. Youn. I hope we can bring more awareness to the Asian community.

The way I think of beauty is beauty is whatever I think looks pretty. Has nothing to do with specific features, but if they come together in a way that I think looks good, they’re beautiful. And even If I don’t think certain individuals are conventionally attractive, they still have interesting things about the way they look that I can admire.; Hello.

Similar to brunette hirls in USA tring to look like Kim K? hard to discipher why....; Oh yeah...I agree that having mixed races having kids is like you never know what you going to get at birth of child. Its absolutely awesome, such a surprise to see how they turn out...they are not a carbon copy of you or hubby they are their own individual mix of uniqueness and when they have blonde, brunette or auburn hair and blue, green, amber or brown eye colours its just so wonderful to see the mix and match going on.  One of my children had monolids with blue eyes, white skin and auburn hair.  They are all beautiful in their own way.

I love East Asian faces. They are gorgeous period.; Ninguém está satisfeito com sua aparência étnica porque entenda é Capitalismo, como a indústria cosmética e cirurgias plásticas iriam te vender coisas que você não precisa se você gostasse da própria aparência? 🤷🏻‍♀️ É por isto que o nariz perfeito só é alcançando com rinoplastia, não importa qual seja a sua étnia. Da mesma forma são diversos aspectos da aparência e da sua vida, de novo não é pessoal é só Capitalismo, puro e simples Capitalismo. Isto me lembra das famosas brasileiras que sofrem bullying por tamanho de testa, não sofre étnias, é sobre estar insatisfeito e ter uma indústria para te vender algo para aliviar sua insatisfação. Uma peruca para seu cabelo, um mega hair para o volume de cabelo, tinta de cabelo, espartilhos, bundex, sutiã com enchimento, sapatos com salto, sapatos que escondem o tamanho do seu pé, bronzeamento falso, lentes de contato… Viu? Uma indústria que lucra com a sua insatisfação, mas não faz diferença da sua etnia, só do seu bolso.; Why do humans want what others want? Be proud of your uniqueness; Im with you  Dr Youn; Thank you for posting this! 🥲🫶everyday I struggle with my appearance, and I’m always thinking when I go to Korea, I’ll get my eyes and nose done! However, when I travelled to Taiwan last year, it was the first time I felt beautiful, because I saw billboards of models with Chinese noses like mines. It was an empowering feeling knowing that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and living in America as an Asian is difficult, in the sense of beauty standards. Thank you again for this reminder that beauty is not just European based.; When I had a brain surgery my Bell’s palsy got noticeably worse and I was having trouble with eye lashes going inverted, constantly irritating eyes so I had gone to eye surgeon about correction. He suggested that this would be a great time to have double eyelids, and correct the inverted eyelashes. I told him that I want to keep my eyes as I came into this world and die with it. He agreed to kept it as is and transplant skin from inside my mouth to inserting it top eyelids. I can see the scars but I don’t regret about keeping it as I was born and I’m glad that I don’t look like everyone else.; Asian features are beautiful,  I hate that they want to change them to look more American. The most beautiful person is the one you are meant to be, not who you can afford to look like; I strongly disagree with many of the comments that seem to say Asians only have monolids. That is implying that our looks are monolothic (haha, like what I did there?). In any case, please do not paint all Asians with a broad phenotypic brush. Many Asians naturally have double eyelids and/or tall noses. These are not &quot;European&quot; features. These are features that are found in multiple ethnicities. Almost my whole family have either double eyelids or high nose bridges or both! Many of my friends as well. And yes, we are natural. <br>When people try to make us monolothic, it wipes away our individuality!; Your little bit wrong not all asian country do many country people they like themselves india, nepal, sri Lanka ,Bangladesh ,bhutan ...; I think assuming asian (eg Korean) beauty standards are geared towards european looks is eurocentric in itself. <br>In my opinion Western and eastern beauty standards are not alike. Eastern ideals are about youthfulness, cutenes. Its more about (European) dolls than actually wanting to look &quot;white&quot;. And sure as hell not kardashian sexy.; When I had my eyelids done I asked the surgeon to put extra stitches on the outer corners of my eyes to make them more “Asian”. I guess the grass is always greener!; I truly think monolids are so much more beautiful than “double eyelids”. Everyone is different, and monolids are a crucial east Asian feature that is a part of what makes the culture so special and the people more beautiful. People’s “eye smiles” just aren’t the same with double eyelids. What I wouldn’t give for mysterious, cat-like, exotic eyes like that! If they had “monolid surgery” I’d seriously consider it if it didn’t mean I wouldn’t look like my parents anymore.; What happens when they have children and they come out with all their old features? Will they push their children to have surgery to match their own looks?; I see how West-centered power work to change how other race to judge things and see themselves, their aesthetic sense and standard.... every thing defined by the West.

Those “mono lids” are the prettiest features ever, just beautiful like a petal ❤❤❤❤❤ its asian for me lol ❤❤😂😅❤; 8 yrs old crazy mom 😮; Thank you for taking this stance. As a monolid Asian woman, I too went through many years of criticism and judgement in my younger days before I learnt to love and embrace my asian features.  I only wish many more plastic surgeons share your convictions and take the same stance to encourage woman, or men, to embrace their natural looks and not conform to social standards of beauty. After all we are all made in the image of God.; Excellent video. I could&#39;t agree more. I always found Asian men and women attractive and beautiful.; Same for breast size....we should see the beauty in all different shapes and sizes of breasts....Monolids?  Small Breasts?  Wide nose?  <br>Accept what God gave you.; I will never understand the need for plastic surgery, unless you have a real deformity due to an accident etc. Nobody does it for themselves, everyone does it for others. After all, you dont see yourself, you only see your effect on others. Frankly, I don&#39;t care that much about other people. I would never get surgery to please them. They can think whatever the hell they want, I couldn&#39;t be bothered. If they don&#39;t like what they see, they can go look at someone else. If someone doesn&#39;t love you without good looks, they will not love you with good looks, they will only love the good looks. They would not be loving you, ever. What kind of insane person are you to get surgery to please someone who guaranteed doesn&#39;t love you?; If you are Asian, you are beautiful!!!! I don’t understand the weird fads. I hope the pendulum swings in the other direction soon.; I am European an I remember in my childhood that I liked monolids to look like Mulan. Haha... <br>Thank you to not support racist plastic surgeries; I understand that plastic surgery for medical condition is necessary.  However for people&#39;s choice,  it&#39;s n9t good.

I&#39;m saying this out of relief knowing that she almost certainly hasn&#39;t undergone invasive surgical procedure in her native South Korea 😁😀.; Korea has a high rate of suicides due to unattainable standards. The government brush these suicides under the rug to keep these factories&#39; so called integrity. In US its plainly called child abuse.; You know its bad when the beauty standard is looking like a holocaust survivor...; I would love to see the fall of east Asians beauty standards .

It can be visible from how talent tv shows in Korea are working, people choosing pretty boys and girls over talented, hardworking ones, and then professionals in industry are having a hard time of making this people at least good.; I never understood why photography of human beings or painting people is forbidden in my religion. But when I see what&#39;s happening now adays with media promoting skinny, and with fake AI I&#39;ve fully understood why this prohibition.; It&#39;s same as boob or bbw surgery in America.; Starving teenagers whose body needs  nutritious food for their growing bodies is a form of violence to me.; Kind of like Fedo; I want you too take a look at the people who snach the food out of the kpop idols.

So sad for the people involved . I know Wrestlers that eat like that just before a match to make weight. after the weigh in dinner; What is wrong with us? It makes me pissed off to see those poor performers collapse on stage. This is insane. Honestly at this point this obsession with being rail thin makes them all look the same. Sickening.  I think if there were kpop bands that were trained without having to be dangerously  thin they would be just as successful. They&#39;d be happier and it would come through in the music. People who have escaped these factories should form their own non toxic groups.; Humans are always easy to profit off of. It is sad how beauty standards change every year and very few people catch on that this is all just BS for the profits of different industries. A general natural beauty standard is just that. When you are often told that there is a new standard, your BS meter should be going off. Nature already tells us what we are attracted to. When industry says otherwise, it is time to call them out on their BS.; selling body and soul for fame ... nothin new; They need them to look like adult children its gross; They are tailor made starts and the popularity they have worries me; as someone who struggled with anorexia myself this video really made me cry; These is not fair I am a Korean and I wanted to be a k-pop but I kept on fainting when I am a teen I am still training; K-pop is what initiated my eating disorder and made me self-conscious about my body, even to this day, after I stopped indulging in their music and culture.; western culture has focused on weight loss forever, look at gymnasts, ballet dancers, wrestlers.  in regards to child like features, westerners are botoxed and had plastic surgery forever too, we are obsessed with reverse aging, pageants and unfortunately the K family.; Jisoo is the only one of the 4 members to not have done surgery tbh; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTzG_Hsb8A&amp;t=705"">11:45</a> That manager looked like she would snatch the food and ate them herself.; How far are people Willing to go!! To be a part of this K-pop saga!! I&#39;ll say this All money 💰 is not Good money when it comes to Your Health and Well Being!! There is a verse in the Bible that says &quot;what good does it do for a Man to gain the world 🌎 only to lose his Soul&quot; I like to elaborate that verse to this issue!!

Looks like the younger the better. All these young girls are so controlled.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTzG_Hsb8A&amp;t=791"">13:11</a> this video of sinb fainting is so heartbreaking. poor girl, I hate how the gfriend girls in general were treated horribly by everyone.; I’ve never seen a society that fucking HATES the way they look more than South Korea. What a fucking shame they have so much body dysmorphia.; I lived in Japan from 1972 to 1978 when TV shows like StarMinic were popular.  Groups like Pink Ladies danced and sang the same routine everytime. People would compete to win the best immitation.   Kpop seems to be another obsession to copy.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTzG_Hsb8A&amp;t=719"">11:59</a> this is so sad; Wait til y&#39;all hear about the Kpop cake theory.; Where were the parents?; Hilarious that koreans created a beauty standard that they can’t fulfill and kartrashians also can’t fulfill their own created standards 😂; I believe there are some ppl who are just gifted and beautiful which is ok, being beautiful or wanting to be beautiful is fine. There are really beautiful ppl which is ok but when it pressures ppl to be that and ur nothing without beauty is when it unhealthy. This is why idol or Asian ppl I believe are miserable or depressed and stressed because they have to fit these unhealthy stereotypes or mold😔😔😔it so sad of course many others struggle with this. So sad; I preferred shopping at BJ&#39;s; I legit started crying at the footage of these girl passing out like that. thats so crazy and sickening that we allow this nonsense; You forgot Karina and Winter of Aespa; Ethnicity doesn&#39;t matter, humans are a messed up species!; They look amazing.  Asians are naturally small boned and I think they are the cutest females.; It’s just so sad that a person is supposed to have a certain weight to be considered acceptable. I’m in the USA and we definitely have an obesity problem here so there’s definitely a difference between being obese and being underweight and just being within a normal weight range - why are people so freaking difficult? It’s really not difficult to just accept people at a healthy weight obviously being obese is not healthy but being underweight is not healthy either.  Just another reason why I prefer my animals over people, but I like nice people.; I so truly miss when we didn’t care what someone looked like &amp; just truly cared about the character of their soul and/or their talent 😢; This is so sad.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTzG_Hsb8A&amp;t=757"">12:37</a> 47kg!?

Objectively speaking, what we have here is probably a lot worse.; Here in Japan being absolutely tiny is a cultural thing too. People here constantly talk about weight, try to lose weight, call themselves fat even though they are a size 0. 🤷‍♀️ Welcome to Asia. I&#39;m 5&#39;9 and a size 8. I&#39;m pretty much seen as morbidly obese here.; Those kpop managers are fat.; This needs to end. K-pop companies are just torturing kids and young people for their own money grab.

How K-POP Destroys Your Body Image: A Video Essay,chaebin n out,2022-06-26T02:00:18Z,"two months of researching, scripting, and editing...and a whole two month hiatus to go along with it. but here's what i can show as ...",A3TSSjihhQ0,"it&#39;s finally out.  now i&#39;m finally going to go grab a seltzer and maybe even some sour patch kids.<br><br>this video would have been uploaded 6 HOURS earlier if youtube hadn&#39;t decided to take that long to determine its copyrights.  smh.  but really, hope you all enjoy!  this is where i&#39;ve been for the past 2 months, nice to see you all again!; Very good of you to end with positivity so viewers leave with positivity in mind 👍; The boys look absolutely homosexual. Something&#39;s in the water over there.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=726"">12:06</a> I honestly don’t understand why people won’t just put monolid tape into their daily makeup routines instead of getting a whole surgery for it- 😭✋; This is an older video, maybe this comment will be lost... But thinspo was already around in the MySpace era, worse even since everything was completely unregulated and there was no body positivity movement to counter this way of thinking.<br><br>Edit: in general, the kpop beauty standards are the same as those in the West in the 90s and 2000&#39;s, except we all wanted to be tan. The other standards and ways of talking about them is the same.; When she read out those beauty standards i laughed, like why the hell does someone need to have all those characteristics? Even the modelling industry is more diverse than the Kpop music industry and Kpop idols are singers and dancers first and foremost; how i feel after feeling prettier after kpop bc im a dupe of chaeyoung from twice; All kpop stans should see this vid at least once, thanks for the work you put into it, I specifically really needed to hear the conclusion, I wish more people felt that way... so really thank you so much :&#39;); I’m glad I found this video. I didn’t think I had an unhealthy relationship with food until I started going to therapy. My therapist and I are starting to deduce the reasoning behind it. One of it being more personal reasons, but the other being the influence of kpop on my life. I love kpop. I got into it when I was around 12 years old and it was extremely impressionable on me. I remember I was obsessed with wanting to look like AOA’s Choa and decided I needed to watch my weight. Which led to me visiting the doctors to check on my vitals and being forced to reach a certain amount of calories each day. Which is also another problem, but the body image issues the kpop industry could instill in young people is scary.; I totally agree. Also the fact that beauty standards change all the time. So why put our bodies and appearances through so much hardship just to look like someone else. I think unique beauty should be more celebrated and encouraged.; The control K-Pop companies have over performers is abusive, if not downright criminal.  To tell a teenager under the age of 18 to get plastic surgery so they can debut is morally reprehensible.  And sadly, the compliance of these naive and desperate performers only perpetuates this toxicity. I&#39;m curious to know if there is an  actors and singers union in South Korea.  if not there needs to be.; Cha eunwoo fits it without plastic surgery; This is, after watching a lot of Videos on Youtube, the most thoughtful and meaningful and well thought-out video, I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Thank you for adding value to this platform and for researching the topic so thoroughly! :); <b>TW: Talk about E.D.s + mention of family issues/loneliness</b><br><br>This video helped me realize why I have been so hard on myself and not on others; because I was comparing myself to people, and not comparing those who I saw. I can appreciate the beauty of each person of everyone but me because I&#39;m not taking the time to appreciate them for their uniqueness.<br><br> I was lucky to have found K-POP vent accounts at time I had been so in deep with the toxic starvation culture and my relapse of anorexia (at that time, I had already relapsed in binge-eating disorder before when this anorexia relapse came, so it was my 4th time experiencing an E.D.), because seeing people just as down as me, just as toxically demeaning to their own bodies was when I was able to truly reflect on my views of my body. I also found solace in the community at the time, and I interacted with sweet people, creating amazing connections I won&#39;t ever take for granted despite their end a long time ago, considering they were the first time in my life I felt appreciated, and like I belonged. <br><br>I am still making a progress that is not the fastest because I have once again relapsed in B.E.D., but I&#39;m much more self aware now, and I am working on improving my eating habits. Although I do have no one to talk to in real life and nobody online really anymore because of my avoidance of many of them, I am glad that I had people back then to show me that trying to go on insane diets won&#39;t make me anything other than miserable.; its a sad reality that a lot of these idols and fans perpetuate these toxic standards. It also feels so hollow to me when an idol campaigns about self love and acceptance when they do everything in their power to change and alter themselves to fit into those toxic standards.; Yuna, jk, rose; How body dysmorphia and refusing to take ownership of your problems and seek therapy ruins your body image*. Once people learn to stop blaming all of their problems on others, they&#39;ll start making progress. But yall dont wanna hear that because it&#39;s easier to point a finger and cry into a bowl of ice cream than it is to actually work on yourself.; That&#39;s why I love Mamamoo. They are of different facial structures, skin color (especially Hwasa), they can sing any genre of music literally any genre, all of them can rap, all of them dance very well and most importantly their fandom, moomoos, are really mature people. they don&#39;t fight or spread hate like other stans.; 12 hours? That&#39;s shorter than like skipping breakfast and not eating till lunch.. that&#39;s normal; I honestly think, that idols deserve all of that recognition they get, plus more. It&#39;s an appreciation for their hard work and sacrifices. Yet people shouldn&#39;t follow in their footsteps unless they are determined like them. The industry itself isn&#39;t nice, but then Hollywood isn&#39;t nice either.; Men visual started with kim jaejoong you can see many idols talking about it; okay so im jut so tired of being the second best i was sad so decided to watch this viedeo okay so there is this girl who is a girl what boy sees pretty as and im her frend and all the girls think im pretty we r sooo much into thins cant belive we are still into friendship as everyone compares us but the sad fact is that all the boys asks her that do you even know how many boys haave crush on u while all i get is ehh shes fine but why the seconbest when i can get the first its so hurtful it feels like im never just enough that girl is 36kgs and im 37 kg I&#39;m trying soooo hard to lose wait i just wanna be happy it just made me so quite and differ I&#39;m so tired i cant deal w thisbut ppl are still like  oh ur fine; Beauty shouldn’t be judged by appearance, but more by personality. (Personal opinion); I remember the interview where Soyeon from (G)-idle called herself ugly, and it keeps reminding of how toxic the kpop industry is to even convince such a pretty and beautiful girl like her that she is ugly.; Intro song CLC sky high ❤❤; These idols all look very very similar.  because they get the same surgeries, same filters.  Thank God They have different hair.  Imagine what it would be like if they all had the same hairstyle!; I think these idols and also the kardashians etc.  are driving the cosmetics and plastic surgery industry.  That a very big amount of money; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=1370"">22:50</a> omg THIS i see so many videos like this talking abt insecurities and each time i see one i just get so much more insecure; This is why people shouldn’t pay attention to music and the media. The whole industry itself is flawed, fake, and hypocritical. Move all the attention away from music and media and towards spiritual growth. And find a partner that does the same. Otherwise they will push their fake distorted unnatural ideals on you and you’ll be depressed and anxious for life.; wow, thank you; Hmm the first &#39;test&#39; was badly done the photos side by side were completely different poses and a couple obscured partially their face 🙃🙃🙃  or was that the point?; I think i got the dose of being near to death due to these k-pop products and now the only thing i do is listen to their music without obsessing or comparing myself to these; Well done, this is a great video essay and should be shared amongst the kpop fans. 🎉; I found white people tend to not have anything on their skin, like no moles!!! 😂; I have never been attracted to Korean men, too mean!; Fans never want to take responsibility for the part they play in this whole thing.; i used to have a plump body and when got into kpop, i started to be conscious as i look huge in photos. 6 years passed, i still couldn&#39;t get back to that shape. i am almost bones now 😭; I am 28 now and I remember when I was 14 seeing Gee for the first time and Genie from SNSD and thinking that Yoona was the most average! I promise... I had no idea then that she was the visual... I just felt like &quot;Oh yeah she is the most average one&quot; so beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. I personally always thought Yuri was the prettiest one! And then was confused seeing them all say to Yoona in a show where they all took care of a baby &quot;you are the pretty one... pretty like aunty yoona&quot; etc and I was like... Wait what? I don&#39;t get it? She is so normal looking? That&#39;s mean I know... but it&#39;s how I thought at 14 years old!?! hahaha Of course she is absolutely gorgeous, but for me personally... She wasn&#39;t the one my eyes were drawn to! I do think she is absolutely beautiful now of course, especially in her commercials for skin care... I miss the SNSD days! xx (Be aware, I&#39;m am actually Australian and white so maybe Yuri fits Australian beauty standards more? Not sure! But I showed all of my Aussie friends when we were 14  and some others liked Sunny and some liked Sooyoung but no one chose Yuri!); Korea doesnt accept puberty. they want these girls to look like little girls. and they probably don&#39;t have regular periods because they are starving.; I had an ed not because of k pop but because of magazines; Ok, this is silly, but when you&#39;re looking at full-body pictures of idols where their knees are out, look at their knees. Most of the time, they are basically edited out. I find this so exaggerated that I&#39;m skeptical of the rest of the photo, so I don&#39;t compare myself to them anymore. <br>It&#39;s also just so fun to notice that they have no knees. I always laugh my butt off.; 5.6 is not 170 cm. It is 5 point 7 feet , as in five foot and three quarters of a foot. <br>but height is measured in foot and inches.5 foot and 6 inches, 5.6 in height is 167.64cm approximately . 170 cm is 5.69, so basically 5 foot and 7 inches, 5.7. <br>Height can’t be converted from metric to imperial with the standard foot to cm converter, it needs a height foot and inches converter and always differs a bit from just foot to cm. <br>I only learned this after moving to the states because it’s so un intuitive.<br>So I’d be curious if idols need to be 167 cm tall or 170 cm tall.; I live and work in Korea with one thing I want to say; while I am not against plastic surgery when I hear &quot;it&#39;s your choice&quot; part of me wants to say-- but it also isn&#39;t. For context, I work in a middle school where often times plastic surgery is a gift for graduation, good grades, etc. It&#39;s also really common in high school for this. The youngest students are 13, and while yes it is their choice to want to get work done this choice isn&#39;t often because of Korea&#39;s built in system of profit. Plastic surgery companies waiting outside schools or on the street handing out items, the constantly pressure of media as SNS promotes getting work done to prevent aging, the beauty standard that tell them they won&#39;t get a good job if they aren&#39;t pretty, and overall weight of the topic. While on one end, the normalization and hyper intensity I think of getting work done with &#39;lunch break nose jobs&#39; and eyelid gifts make it so majority of Korean and non-Korean people see work as their choice but a choice of out necessity to get as soon as possible. There is no idea anymore of waiting until your brain fully develops or understanding if its truly something you want or are only doing it because the beauty standard is making you which many of these plastic surgeons prey on people like this. Overall this is what makes plastic surgery such a complex topic specific here in Korea and everywhere else as it&#39;s growing to be a normal thing, more than just on if the person is happy or not with it [which has other complex issues as plastic surgery often can&#39;t fix the root of the emotional problem people who are getting lots of work done face and in a job where sometimes its not a choice but a pressure].; Eunchae said le serrafim members share 1 dish between the 5 of them and have leftovers....; Hands down, the transitions are so good. 👏👏👏 love the video :); I realized that kpop, especially its fakeness and toxicity and the fandoms are not good for me and my mental health. <br><br>I feel so much better since i took a step back and distanced myself from it.<br>I only listen to the music now but dont stan any groups anymore. <br>They seem so open and funny at first but in reality they all lie and everything is scripted. Acting as if theyre all single and acting as if they love their fans so much etc… <br>Content is most of the time scripted and there is almost no live singing anymore. <br>Really, its going down with kpop. Appearances and visuals is number 1 priority now, all the idols are almost looking the same. They get the same surgeries, the same nose; the same double eyelids; the same faceshape and they all have the same bodytype (extremly skinny). No one wants to stand out, or theyre not allowed to stand out. Its as if theyre trained to be robots. <br>And the fandoms are so toxic i dont even have words for it. Kpop changed so much. It became a mass production, more and faster and more fake. It became unauthentic. And what also annoys me that kpop became a 24/7 advertisment show. Ive been here for singer, rapper and dancer not for models. Ofc idols always did advertising jobs but the amount nowadays is crazy. Every 2nd post is an advertisement. Its annoying and sad what happened to kpop; I saw kpop stars in real life they look unhealthy.; When you ask who is beautiful, for real, I cannot choose, they are all beautiful; I mean k beauty is a sham 90% plastic surgery; i would gladly eat only that if i made that money lol; TLDR: Beautiful is everyone, but not everyone sees beautiful as everyone. In the case of these idols, their ability to keep their own careers is based on how well they fit the beauty standard. Although idols are the most egregious case, based on my own experience, this is every field if you are a women. Beautiful is everyone, but if you don’t fit the beauty standard you will be the denied a job, and subsequently, your life. Sadly, even if it’s unhealthy, I know that I will at least eventually have to assimilate. I’ll have to take on dangerous dieting methods because it’s either dying to that, or dying because I couldn’t support myself. at least one of these is not guaranteed. unless of course, one of you people in this comment section can tell me otherwise. I’m open to hearing you.<br><br>I agree with what is said here. This is how it should be and by you making this video, hopefully that would be the case. i’m a senior in college, and I’m trying to get into a stem field as a woman. in one of my classes, I think I might’ve been confronted with sexism. And it’s not overt, and I don’t think it’s REALLY sexism. I don’t think he’s doing it for sexism. But the same sort of tactics I know will be used on me in the industry, and that will be sexism when that happens. So even though I don’t believe the intent was to discriminate against me, I was still confronted by the fact that even though this is how it should be it’s not.<br><br>Every single time I try to ask a question about homework or clarification about subject within one of my stem classes, I am told by the teacher that I am idi!ot for asking and then he would’ve refused to answer the question. But when my peers ask similar questions, he goes over and helps them. I am one out of two girls in whole class and major. <br><br>I’m trying to avoid examples cause I might lose you, it’s tech stuff. But to at least still try. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you can’t keep up with it. I understand. <br>In Java, which is the class I’m referring to here, in order to allow for a text input you need to import a module called scanner. You can think of it as getting wood to build a house. I need to get the would that would help build the mailbox, to allow people to put in letters. Those letters are input. Scanner is used to make the mailbox for the house. this mailbox though, must be built in a certain way or else it will collapse when holding letters. that was the part I need help with. to jump out the metaphor. I need to import it, which is putting a line of code before the start of the program. I also must create an instance of that package. Which creates one mailbox. You can have multiple mailboxes, but this creates one. When I did this, my program crashed. And I couldn’t figure out why it was. So I asked the teacher for help. He told me he wasn’t going to help because having any difficulty with this. He told me that he taught this enough times to where I shouldn’t be having any difficulty with it. So turns out it was a spelling error. So luckily this was not a problem where I couldn’t see myself, but another student had an issue not a scanner but with another spelling thing and he was willing to help that student. He even went over to look over his shoulder to check over his code. he would never do that for me. he’s made it clear that he sees me as a class id!0t. <br>If I lost you on that last paragraph I’m sorry I am not a teacher for a reason.<br><br>So I was treated differently in the class, but it wasn’t because of sexism. There are two women in the class including myself. If this was an issue where it was about sexism, it would’ve happened to the other woman in the class as well. It did not. He did this last year although not with me. There was a guy who sat behind me who is no longer majoring in computer science. He would often be made fun of by the teacher in class. he told him he wasn’t smart enough to get in the industry. So, although it is an assumption that I don’t know this for sure, I speculate there is a reason for why he dropped the major. after he dropped the major, this is when I started to get treated the same way. so based off that it’s not beast off of my gender, it’s the fact that he wants a class !d!ot. I don’t know why he selected me, but nonetheless I was selected. My regret is not calling this out when it wasn’t me. But I’m already really far off topic.<br><br><br><br>So what does this have to do with this video? If this case was not about sexism, why am I still citing it? Even though it’s not about sexism, I know that this will eventually will be. I know from at least one woman I know who is in the industry right now, it will be about sexism even at right now it’s not. it’s all fun and games when it’s not you on the table but when you’re actually confronted with it even in this more distant way that I did, what do you do? videos like this one it’s just like don’t listen to them, stand up for yourself. But I know if I actually do that, I’ll be fired, the same way I can’t speak up right now because I know that if I say anything the teacher will retaliate. this is not the first time a teacher is hostile towards students, it may be the first time in the college that it was particularly one student, but hostile towards students is not a new thing when it comes to this college. My constitution class, a class I’m required to take to graduate, he said that nobody is getting above a C even if there are no errors. if you get a 100% on the test, that will be graded as a C. he had his reasons, he told it was the combat grade inflation. this class in my college is infamous for being the worst class anyone will ever take at the college. And I didn’t even take the full class. I was there for three class days before I decided I would take my chances with the online class. I know, for not reporting this case, but for reporting anything on the campus of that puts you in jeopardy. This one made headlines so maybe you’ll figure out which college I’m going to. But there is a person who whistle on someone who waits a bunch of female students at my college. So what the school mandated her to do is to always sit by him in the classes she shared with him. They forced her to do this. she was lucky in the case that it made headlines, other cases that happen at this college are very much under reported. <br><br>Confronted with this, I decided not to step up. After all, the Internet is a vast place so I’m sure I can find someone who can help me with any problem I might have. This is resulted in me having to learn the material through online sources rather than through the class. This frustrates me because I’m the only student who’s doing it. No other student feels like they are threatened when asking questions. my answer to this question is to listen. If he wants me to stop asking questions, I stop asking questions.<br><br>Finally, this is what I’m trying to get at and why this actually relates to the video. I know I shouldn’t be judged on how I look, but I will be. The sad answer that I have come to is that I have to assimilate. if my weight becomes an issue, I will take on that dating method not because it’s healthy but because to not do so risk my job and my livelihood. I don’t know how far I will take this and I hope I don’t have to take it far. I hope that I don’t half to be put on such a severe diet, but it’s a possibility. I am a woman, and my worth is based on my looks. The same way it is right here all the way more noticeably.<br><br>But I don’t want to assimilate. After all, I am being dishonest with who I actually am when I try to fit a box. but right now I don’t see any actual solution. The ones that are typically suggested is in this video. Beautiful should be everyone, but everyone doesn’t see beautiful as beautiful. They will treat me differently based on whether I can fit the beauty standard of what ever industry I’m going in. Yes, I could work at a gas station but even there this beauty standards are applied. they might be the most loose, but they’re still there. as someone who worked at the gas station employee. do you know another hair color that I really would like to have? Pink. But, I was unsure how I was gonna rock it so I got a wig first. I got treated so differently not because they could tell it’s a wig. They thought I got my hair done and I was told that. So they did believe it was my hair dyed, but I was treated so much worse just for having that on. Even if they could tell it was a wig, isn’t everyone beautiful? I did expressed at least a small part of myself, my favorite color is pink. also, as everyone is stated, minimum wage is not minimum to live. I must get a job that will actually be able to support myself or I will die because I didn’t have enough money to pay rent. I already have college debt, so I really really hope I get in the industry.; These are rookie numbers they need to look at high school wrestling in the 90s.  &quot;Put on 10 trash bags and go run 3 miles&quot;  fuck yea!; Did you seriously say in the beginning that k pop introduced you to hip hop. As if k pop itself wasn’t modeled after hip hop???; this is such an amazing video; Celebrity worship is a mental disorder; Thank you so much ❤ I appreciate your work 💟; hear me out.. if ur audience gets triggered by all those things u keep warning them about.. its not ur problem.. dont. make. people. soft.; how can kpop destroy your confidence lmao. Those people are so 🤮 and constantly get surgery because they&#39;re not gifted.  thank goodness i actually have well defined features. Sucks to be them i guess; Are girls really that impressionable? I’m a guy that doesn’t fit the ideal, but it doesn’t bother me one bit when I watch male kpop groups.; It’s not just the surgeries but they have excessive filters for both pictures and videos. Their cameras have built in filters; kpop HAS destroyed my body image. now i cannot look at even fit people or myself and think &quot;so fat&quot;; All three i picked were non visuals lol😂; Exercise and healghy diet. Dont cut your bones for others appproval, dont cut your flesh for looking good bug pose serious life threats while going through immense pain; I would love to know how many times Momo has been reprimanded by her agency just for being brutally honest about that ice cube “diet” story; the thing that really pisses me off as someone who likes a few kpop groups and has been dealing with an ed is idols messaging their fans every time they gain weight (with the exact measurements ofc) and then telling everyone what their diet is and saying &quot;it&#39;s in order for you to like the way i look&quot;<br>and then the same people are telling their fans not to starve themselves and that they&#39;re pretty no matter what<br>i do understand that dieting and looks play a huge role in kpop but if you&#39;re an idol and you&#39;re against it why spread it among your fans??; Honestly, this is why I hate the concept of „having a bias“. Can we please appreciate everyone and not automatically start ranking people 🤯; thank you for speaking on this, People will preach that kpop diets r harmful but turn around and say &quot;oh my god! yeojin &amp; wonyoung body goals&quot; like theyre not women who have been on harmful diets since their early teens.; I literally chose the opposite of every visual position 😂; in North Korea, you lose weight because of tyranny<br>in South Korea, you lose weight because of chasing trend; For me, it is my acne/acne scars. My hormones are not working the way they are supposed to, and I cannot use medication to fix my hormones or clear my acne. I have tried in the past and paid the prize with an eye that could not function properly for a year due to the side effects of medicines. I guess I will just live with this for the rest of my life.; TW:ED<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this video comforted me. As a K-pop fan since I was 7 years old, I was greatly influenced. I started changing up the way I dressed and my style; basically, K-pop was my style my whole life. Then, as the years went by, I got so obsessed with K-pop that I  thought that they were the most &quot;perfect&quot; people and really wanted to even look like them, and I would look at myself in the mirror and think that I was really ugly and &quot;fat,&quot; even though I really wasn&#39;t. When I was 10 and turning 11, I started becoming more insecure about how I looked, and slowly I started to eat even less. On top of that, some kids, as well as my teacher at my school, lowered my self-esteem and confidence and would say that I was ugly, awkward, and all kinds of stuff. Then, a month after I turned 11, I started calorie counting, constantly lying to my parents that I ate my lunch and breakfast, and then I would have to forcefully eat dinner because my parents would be around at that time. At that time, WIEIAD videos were really trending, and I never realized how little calories they were eating at that time, but I still followed them. I even shortened the size of the plate I used as well as my cultilary, to the point where I would literally eat with teaspoons. Every day, I would wake up, my bones would hurt, I felt like I could pass out anytime, I felt no energy to do anything at all, and I would also get triggered easily. I was always tired and cold; most of the time I was lonely; I would never talk to anyone; I would give an attitude to my parents; and after realizing what I did, I feel really bad now, to be honest. Then I started having a bunch of hair grow on my back, face, and arms, and my hands started turning purple. Every time I would eat something and even drink some water, my stomach would be so painful that I couldn&#39;t even walk properly. One day, things got really bad; I even lost my period, and I told my parents. I was sent to the hospital; I was diagnosed with anorexia; and I had my vitals done and stuff. Turns out, I was underweight, my heartbeat was running at 46 bpm, my blood sugar level and blood pressure were extremely low, nurses would watch me eat all the time, I wasn&#39;t even allowed to walk, I always had to be on a wheel chair, as well as not being able to go to the washroom. I stayed there for 3–4 months. Now, I&#39;m an outpatient. I turned 12, which has been going on for basically a year, and I still haven&#39;t gotten my period back. From time to time, I skip meals because I feel like I gained weight, and I would try to vomit what I ate. I&#39;m 96 pounds, 12 years old, and 156 cm, whereas when I was anorexic, I was 72 pounds, 11 years old, and 153cm. Honestly, I still struggle with loving myself and having confidence, and I even wish that I were anorexic again. I still look in the mirror and think I&#39;m so ugly, and I would rather not wake up the following day than see myself again. I wish that I would look like those pretty K-pop idols with such great bodies, but this video you made helped me realize that they are also starving themselves and only pretty due to plastic surgery and all the Photoshop, so thank you.; I come back to this video from time to time as a reminder. As a girl that has been everywhere from having a green tint to my skin from starvation to being right below a morbidly obese qualification, having a healthy perspective on food and what &#39;healthy&#39; really is can sometimes be hard to maintain. I got into k pop I think 4 years ago now, and it&#39;s hard to not compare myself (a short, chunky, normal-faced person lol) to every idol I see. <br><br>Videos like this really help people like me, but even more importantly help spread the knowledge that these beauty standards we see in idols are almost always constructed - they are not naturally occurring all in a single person, let alone an entire industry full of them. Beauty is subjective, and no one needs to feel like they have to fit into a tiny, VERY specific box of qualities just to be beautiful. Thanks for a great video!; remember these guys are IDOLS. which means people look up to them and idolize them. Then the appearance standards must be higher than an average person&#39;s looks. In short, they have to stand out. As brutal as it sounds, this career is not for the weak-hearted. Similar to a body trainer, you have to train your boy to look good in front of the audience. If you don&#39;t like it, then do not be a K-pop star. there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.; I always bias people based on preference as in personality not visuals because everyone including fans is beautiful in their own way…but with me unfortunately so many people don’t believe that. Just love yourself first and then you will learn to love others; I don&#39;t care what people might say to this but... THE DANCES ARE HORRIBLE. this is not dancing at all just random movement of limbs and just too much. I personally prefer street dancing instead since the movement isn&#39;t desperate for attention but just free; I literally have never heard any of their songs and not even interested when I know personally that most Koreans don&#39;t look like that. It&#39;s called plastic surgery, beauty enhancements and a lot of training to be that way to influence the society.; This is the main reason why I stopped listening to kpop :(; Y&#39;all i have a doubt<br>My skin irl looks different from my neck like my face is lighter and my neck is a Lil dark than my face but sometimes it&#39;s like my face is darker than my neck so does it mean that I got edited irl 💀🤸🏻‍♀️; I get it, like beauty standards are different. I live in the USA and came from Korea. My beauty standards arent popular in the USA. In the USA, we want sharper brows, bigger lips, small noses, big chests, more weight, big butts. But on the other side in Korea, its different. So just look in the mirror, look at your face, dont change it, god gave you a face no one else has, love yourself, we all have our own beauty, it doesnt matter if someone else is &quot;prettier&quot; just know that you are too and you shouldnt ever look at yourself and say &quot;oh I&#39;m not beautiful&quot; you are!; I have a body that will be perfect for female kbs, but im a boy...; I tried to see you video!  however I couldn’t…… sorry; i was wondering if you were going to mention mamamoo! so glad you did (in a subtle way). they&#39;re inspirational to me. <br>great video! so much work was put into this and it shows. this is an important topic, and i&#39;m glad you brought attention to it in a gracious and balanced way.; kpop has made some girls who would otherwise be my type become skinny ghouls that are so weak and unhealthy they can’t even do a single pull up; I don’t see any bodies that are destroyed all gorgeous; The way you focus your last argument is really inspiring. I look at myself everyday and I find in the mirror the person who takes me places, who takes care of my body and soul, who dances while doing the dishes and whom I love and defend above anything in the world. Loving oneself doesn&#39;t need justification, it comes naturally to everyone, that&#39;s why we hate being criticized, so all we need to do (without falling in the narcissistic mode) is remember how lucky we are, and count our many blessings.; About 30 minutes ago I wanted to be a K-pop idol, and now? I still do but I&#39;m slowly losing interest in becoming an idol, I thought about trying out for different companies (the ones I wanted to try out for were SM,YG and HYBE) I was trying to lose weight so I didn&#39;t eat for 3 days, until my mom found out that I wasn&#39;t eating and I had to eat in front of her because she didn&#39;t trust me anymore. During the time I didn&#39;t eat I felt very weak, dizzy, depressed and nauseous, on top of that I also was also practicing my dancing and singing while not eating so that made me feel worse.<br><br>A little more context: I&#39;m 15 and my original weight was 192 now I&#39;m 173, and no I didn&#39;t drop 21 pounds in 3 days, I was using different apps to help myself lose weight while still eating one small snack a day BEFORE I stopped eating completely. <br><br>PLEASE DONT TRY THE METHOD I USED!! (it does NOT feel good, nor is it worth it I just wanted to share my story and maybe help someone else who&#39;s going through something similar!); I struggled with the first quiz, because I honestly couldn’t choose who was most beautiful 😅; tbh, I have tried more extreme diets. I&#39;ve lived off a tomato and 2 tbsp of sauerkraut before, lol.  I loved your video because it is so well put together and I think you make many great points.  I will say this though: we will never give up those standards because it is not so much about vanity.  It&#39;s about stopping the crazy stuff going on in our minds.  In addition, we all know that looks and our bodies do matter and when people say it doesn&#39;t, they sound patronising. Peace be with you.; I&#39;ve wanted to be a k-pop idol, just the idea of dancing and singing for a living is a dream to me, but I&#39;ve always been chubby. When I first get into k-pop I was aware that i wasn&#39;t k-pop idol pretty which makes me feel really bad about myself at the time at least. I still find myself comparing myself to others.. I wish  the mentality around  k-pop changes for more diversity and self love.<br><br>I won&#39;t give up on my dreams just yet though, I know it gonna be hard but i will find my way to it :) ( I know it sounds corny lol and also excuse my English as it is not my first language).; YUP when guys say they like kpop girls theyre so healthy i roll my eyes and say theyre anorexic mate. i my self am anorexic, had to have medications to fatten me up; If you ever saw a Korean nose job and know how it looks you’ll see more than half of Korean idols (actors, singers etc) have very similar nose job. It is not ugly but ever since realizing and just looking 3 seconds and being able to tell “oh they got a nose job” I realized there is no need for me to envy them as much. Of course just a nose doesn’t makes u automatically pretty, but just the fact that so many get the same looking nose it’s kind of funny; Every single time i try to watch a video like this about actual issues it always ends up being an ugly lazy &quot;everyone is beautiful&quot; girl😂; In the end she puts up pictures of ugly people and goes &quot;i think theyre ALL beautiful&quot; <br><br>Tells you everything you need to know about the delusional fools who make such videos; As an asian I don&#39;t see any idol attractive cause everyone looks the same. Nothing special or unique. That is why I only like gangnaam style.; I agree with everything on this videos😭; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=230"">3:50</a> the only exception being loona , even tho hyunjin is the visual chuu is the most famous because of her persona; The thing I always found so odd regarding plastic surgery is that... even if they do go through with it to fit the beauty standards, they&#39;ll still get bashed for it for not being a &quot;natural&quot; beauty. People constantly dig up photos of idols during their pre-debut days and debate on whether or not it&#39;s plastic surgery or just styling (make-up, double eyelid tape, etc.); starving is one thing but starving and working out is just wow 😟; Bye i had to leave kpop fandom bcs i got an ed; i stopped liking kpop when it started influencing my anorexia","How K-POP Destroys Your Body Image: A Video Essay two months of researching, scripting, and editing...and a whole two month hiatus to go along with it. but here's what i can show as ... it&#39;s finally out.  now i&#39;m finally going to go grab a seltzer and maybe even some sour patch kids.<br><br>this video would have been uploaded 6 HOURS earlier if youtube hadn&#39;t decided to take that long to determine its copyrights.  smh.  but really, hope you all enjoy!  this is where i&#39;ve been for the past 2 months, nice to see you all again!; Very good of you to end with positivity so viewers leave with positivity in mind 👍; The boys look absolutely homosexual.

But thinspo was already around in the MySpace era, worse even since everything was completely unregulated and there was no body positivity movement to counter this way of thinking.<br><br>Edit: in general, the kpop beauty standards are the same as those in the West in the 90s and 2000&#39;s, except we all wanted to be tan. The other standards and ways of talking about them is the same.; When she read out those beauty standards i laughed, like why the hell does someone need to have all those characteristics? Even the modelling industry is more diverse than the Kpop music industry and Kpop idols are singers and dancers first and foremost; how i feel after feeling prettier after kpop bc im a dupe of chaeyoung from twice; All kpop stans should see this vid at least once, thanks for the work you put into it, I specifically really needed to hear the conclusion, I wish more people felt that way... so really thank you so much :&#39;); I’m glad I found this video. I didn’t think I had an unhealthy relationship with food until I started going to therapy. My therapist and I are starting to deduce the reasoning behind it. One of it being more personal reasons, but the other being the influence of kpop on my life. I love kpop. I got into it when I was around 12 years old and it was extremely impressionable on me. I remember I was obsessed with wanting to look like AOA’s Choa and decided I needed to watch my weight. Which led to me visiting the doctors to check on my vitals and being forced to reach a certain amount of calories each day. Which is also another problem, but the body image issues the kpop industry could instill in young people is scary.; I totally agree. Also the fact that beauty standards change all the time. So why put our bodies and appearances through so much hardship just to look like someone else. I think unique beauty should be more celebrated and encouraged.; The control K-Pop companies have over performers is abusive, if not downright criminal.  To tell a teenager under the age of 18 to get plastic surgery so they can debut is morally reprehensible.  And sadly, the compliance of these naive and desperate performers only perpetuates this toxicity. I&#39;m curious to know if there is an  actors and singers union in South Korea.  if not there needs to be.; Cha eunwoo fits it without plastic surgery; This is, after watching a lot of Videos on Youtube, the most thoughtful and meaningful and well thought-out video, I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Thank you for adding value to this platform and for researching the topic so thoroughly! :); <b>TW: Talk about E.D.s + mention of family issues/loneliness</b><br><br>This video helped me realize why I have been so hard on myself and not on others; because I was comparing myself to people, and not comparing those who I saw. I can appreciate the beauty of each person of everyone but me because I&#39;m not taking the time to appreciate them for their uniqueness.<br><br> I was lucky to have found K-POP vent accounts at time I had been so in deep with the toxic starvation culture and my relapse of anorexia (at that time, I had already relapsed in binge-eating disorder before when this anorexia relapse came, so it was my 4th time experiencing an E.D.), because seeing people just as down as me, just as toxically demeaning to their own bodies was when I was able to truly reflect on my views of my body. I also found solace in the community at the time, and I interacted with sweet people, creating amazing connections I won&#39;t ever take for granted despite their end a long time ago, considering they were the first time in my life I felt appreciated, and like I belonged. <br><br>I am still making a progress that is not the fastest because I have once again relapsed in B.E.D., but I&#39;m much more self aware now, and I am working on improving my eating habits. Although I do have no one to talk to in real life and nobody online really anymore because of my avoidance of many of them, I am glad that I had people back then to show me that trying to go on insane diets won&#39;t make me anything other than miserable.; its a sad reality that a lot of these idols and fans perpetuate these toxic standards. It also feels so hollow to me when an idol campaigns about self love and acceptance when they do everything in their power to change and alter themselves to fit into those toxic standards.; Yuna, jk, rose; How body dysmorphia and refusing to take ownership of your problems and seek therapy ruins your body image*. Once people learn to stop blaming all of their problems on others, they&#39;ll start making progress. But yall dont wanna hear that because it&#39;s easier to point a finger and cry into a bowl of ice cream than it is to actually work on yourself.; That&#39;s why I love Mamamoo. They are of different facial structures, skin color (especially Hwasa), they can sing any genre of music literally any genre, all of them can rap, all of them dance very well and most importantly their fandom, moomoos, are really mature people. they don&#39;t fight or spread hate like other stans.; 12 hours? That&#39;s shorter than like skipping breakfast and not eating till lunch.. that&#39;s normal; I honestly think, that idols deserve all of that recognition they get, plus more. It&#39;s an appreciation for their hard work and sacrifices. Yet people shouldn&#39;t follow in their footsteps unless they are determined like them. The industry itself isn&#39;t nice, but then Hollywood isn&#39;t nice either.; Men visual started with kim jaejoong you can see many idols talking about it; okay so im jut so tired of being the second best i was sad so decided to watch this viedeo okay so there is this girl who is a girl what boy sees pretty as and im her frend and all the girls think im pretty we r sooo much into thins cant belive we are still into friendship as everyone compares us but the sad fact is that all the boys asks her that do you even know how many boys haave crush on u while all i get is ehh shes fine but why the seconbest when i can get the first its so hurtful it feels like im never just enough that girl is 36kgs and im 37 kg I&#39;m trying soooo hard to lose wait i just wanna be happy it just made me so quite and differ I&#39;m so tired i cant deal w thisbut ppl are still like  oh ur fine; Beauty shouldn’t be judged by appearance, but more by personality. (Personal opinion); I remember the interview where Soyeon from (G)-idle called herself ugly, and it keeps reminding of how toxic the kpop industry is to even convince such a pretty and beautiful girl like her that she is ugly.; Intro song CLC sky high ❤❤; These idols all look very very similar.  because they get the same surgeries, same filters.  Thank God They have different hair.  Imagine what it would be like if they all had the same hairstyle!; I think these idols and also the kardashians etc.  are driving the cosmetics and plastic surgery industry.  That a very big amount of money; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=1370"">22:50</a> omg THIS i see so many videos like this talking abt insecurities and each time i see one i just get so much more insecure; This is why people shouldn’t pay attention to music and the media. The whole industry itself is flawed, fake, and hypocritical. Move all the attention away from music and media and towards spiritual growth. And find a partner that does the same. Otherwise they will push their fake distorted unnatural ideals on you and you’ll be depressed and anxious for life.; wow, thank you; Hmm the first &#39;test&#39; was badly done the photos side by side were completely different poses and a couple obscured partially their face 🙃🙃🙃  or was that the point?; I think i got the dose of being near to death due to these k-pop products and now the only thing i do is listen to their music without obsessing or comparing myself to these; Well done, this is a great video essay and should be shared amongst the kpop fans. 🎉; I found white people tend to not have anything on their skin, like no moles!!! 😂; I have never been attracted to Korean men, too mean!; Fans never want to take responsibility for the part they play in this whole thing.; i used to have a plump body and when got into kpop, i started to be conscious as i look huge in photos. 6 years passed, i still couldn&#39;t get back to that shape. i am almost bones now 😭; I am 28 now and I remember when I was 14 seeing Gee for the first time and Genie from SNSD and thinking that Yoona was the most average! I promise... I had no idea then that she was the visual... I just felt like &quot;Oh yeah she is the most average one&quot; so beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. I personally always thought Yuri was the prettiest one! And then was confused seeing them all say to Yoona in a show where they all took care of a baby &quot;you are the pretty one... pretty like aunty yoona&quot; etc and I was like... Wait what? I don&#39;t get it? She is so normal looking? That&#39;s mean I know... but it&#39;s how I thought at 14 years old!?! hahaha Of course she is absolutely gorgeous, but for me personally... She wasn&#39;t the one my eyes were drawn to! I do think she is absolutely beautiful now of course, especially in her commercials for skin care... I miss the SNSD days! xx (Be aware, I&#39;m am actually Australian and white so maybe Yuri fits Australian beauty standards more? Not sure! But I showed all of my Aussie friends when we were 14  and some others liked Sunny and some liked Sooyoung but no one chose Yuri!); Korea doesnt accept puberty. they want these girls to look like little girls. and they probably don&#39;t have regular periods because they are starving.; I had an ed not because of k pop but because of magazines; Ok, this is silly, but when you&#39;re looking at full-body pictures of idols where their knees are out, look at their knees. Most of the time, they are basically edited out. I find this so exaggerated that I&#39;m skeptical of the rest of the photo, so I don&#39;t compare myself to them anymore. <br>It&#39;s also just so fun to notice that they have no knees. I always laugh my butt off.; 5.6 is not 170 cm. It is 5 point 7 feet , as in five foot and three quarters of a foot. <br>but height is measured in foot and inches.5 foot and 6 inches, 5.6 in height is 167.64cm approximately . 170 cm is 5.69, so basically 5 foot and 7 inches, 5.7. <br>Height can’t be converted from metric to imperial with the standard foot to cm converter, it needs a height foot and inches converter and always differs a bit from just foot to cm. <br>I only learned this after moving to the states because it’s so un intuitive.<br>So I’d be curious if idols need to be 167 cm tall or 170 cm tall.; I live and work in Korea with one thing I want to say; while I am not against plastic surgery when I hear &quot;it&#39;s your choice&quot; part of me wants to say-- but it also isn&#39;t. For context, I work in a middle school where often times plastic surgery is a gift for graduation, good grades, etc. It&#39;s also really common in high school for this. The youngest students are 13, and while yes it is their choice to want to get work done this choice isn&#39;t often because of Korea&#39;s built in system of profit. Plastic surgery companies waiting outside schools or on the street handing out items, the constantly pressure of media as SNS promotes getting work done to prevent aging, the beauty standard that tell them they won&#39;t get a good job if they aren&#39;t pretty, and overall weight of the topic. While on one end, the normalization and hyper intensity I think of getting work done with &#39;lunch break nose jobs&#39; and eyelid gifts make it so majority of Korean and non-Korean people see work as their choice but a choice of out necessity to get as soon as possible. There is no idea anymore of waiting until your brain fully develops or understanding if its truly something you want or are only doing it because the beauty standard is making you which many of these plastic surgeons prey on people like this. Overall this is what makes plastic surgery such a complex topic specific here in Korea and everywhere else as it&#39;s growing to be a normal thing, more than just on if the person is happy or not with it [which has other complex issues as plastic surgery often can&#39;t fix the root of the emotional problem people who are getting lots of work done face and in a job where sometimes its not a choice but a pressure].; Eunchae said le serrafim members share 1 dish between the 5 of them and have leftovers....; Hands down, the transitions are so good. 👏👏👏 love the video :); I realized that kpop, especially its fakeness and toxicity and the fandoms are not good for me and my mental health. <br><br>I feel so much better since i took a step back and distanced myself from it.<br>I only listen to the music now but dont stan any groups anymore. <br>They seem so open and funny at first but in reality they all lie and everything is scripted. Acting as if theyre all single and acting as if they love their fans so much etc… <br>Content is most of the time scripted and there is almost no live singing anymore. <br>Really, its going down with kpop. Appearances and visuals is number 1 priority now, all the idols are almost looking the same. They get the same surgeries, the same nose; the same double eyelids; the same faceshape and they all have the same bodytype (extremly skinny). No one wants to stand out, or theyre not allowed to stand out. Its as if theyre trained to be robots. <br>And the fandoms are so toxic i dont even have words for it. Kpop changed so much. It became a mass production, more and faster and more fake. It became unauthentic. And what also annoys me that kpop became a 24/7 advertisment show. Ive been here for singer, rapper and dancer not for models. Ofc idols always did advertising jobs but the amount nowadays is crazy. Every 2nd post is an advertisement. Its annoying and sad what happened to kpop; I saw kpop stars in real life they look unhealthy.; When you ask who is beautiful, for real, I cannot choose, they are all beautiful; I mean k beauty is a sham 90% plastic surgery; i would gladly eat only that if i made that money lol; TLDR: Beautiful is everyone, but not everyone sees beautiful as everyone. In the case of these idols, their ability to keep their own careers is based on how well they fit the beauty standard. Although idols are the most egregious case, based on my own experience, this is every field if you are a women. Beautiful is everyone, but if you don’t fit the beauty standard you will be the denied a job, and subsequently, your life. Sadly, even if it’s unhealthy, I know that I will at least eventually have to assimilate. I’ll have to take on dangerous dieting methods because it’s either dying to that, or dying because I couldn’t support myself. at least one of these is not guaranteed. unless of course, one of you people in this comment section can tell me otherwise. I’m open to hearing you.<br><br>I agree with what is said here. This is how it should be and by you making this video, hopefully that would be the case. i’m a senior in college, and I’m trying to get into a stem field as a woman. in one of my classes, I think I might’ve been confronted with sexism. And it’s not overt, and I don’t think it’s REALLY sexism. I don’t think he’s doing it for sexism. But the same sort of tactics I know will be used on me in the industry, and that will be sexism when that happens. So even though I don’t believe the intent was to discriminate against me, I was still confronted by the fact that even though this is how it should be it’s not.<br><br>Every single time I try to ask a question about homework or clarification about subject within one of my stem classes, I am told by the teacher that I am idi!ot for asking and then he would’ve refused to answer the question. But when my peers ask similar questions, he goes over and helps them. I am one out of two girls in whole class and major. <br><br>I’m trying to avoid examples cause I might lose you, it’s tech stuff. But to at least still try. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you can’t keep up with it. I understand. <br>In Java, which is the class I’m referring to here, in order to allow for a text input you need to import a module called scanner. You can think of it as getting wood to build a house. I need to get the would that would help build the mailbox, to allow people to put in letters. Those letters are input. Scanner is used to make the mailbox for the house. this mailbox though, must be built in a certain way or else it will collapse when holding letters. that was the part I need help with. to jump out the metaphor. I need to import it, which is putting a line of code before the start of the program. I also must create an instance of that package. Which creates one mailbox. You can have multiple mailboxes, but this creates one. When I did this, my program crashed. And I couldn’t figure out why it was. So I asked the teacher for help. He told me he wasn’t going to help because having any difficulty with this. He told me that he taught this enough times to where I shouldn’t be having any difficulty with it. So turns out it was a spelling error. So luckily this was not a problem where I couldn’t see myself, but another student had an issue not a scanner but with another spelling thing and he was willing to help that student. He even went over to look over his shoulder to check over his code. he would never do that for me. he’s made it clear that he sees me as a class id!0t. <br>If I lost you on that last paragraph I’m sorry I am not a teacher for a reason.<br><br>So I was treated differently in the class, but it wasn’t because of sexism. There are two women in the class including myself. If this was an issue where it was about sexism, it would’ve happened to the other woman in the class as well. It did not. He did this last year although not with me. There was a guy who sat behind me who is no longer majoring in computer science. He would often be made fun of by the teacher in class. he told him he wasn’t smart enough to get in the industry. So, although it is an assumption that I don’t know this for sure, I speculate there is a reason for why he dropped the major. after he dropped the major, this is when I started to get treated the same way. so based off that it’s not beast off of my gender, it’s the fact that he wants a class !d!ot. I don’t know why he selected me, but nonetheless I was selected. My regret is not calling this out when it wasn’t me. But I’m already really far off topic.<br><br><br><br>So what does this have to do with this video? If this case was not about sexism, why am I still citing it? Even though it’s not about sexism, I know that this will eventually will be. I know from at least one woman I know who is in the industry right now, it will be about sexism even at right now it’s not. it’s all fun and games when it’s not you on the table but when you’re actually confronted with it even in this more distant way that I did, what do you do? videos like this one it’s just like don’t listen to them, stand up for yourself. But I know if I actually do that, I’ll be fired, the same way I can’t speak up right now because I know that if I say anything the teacher will retaliate. this is not the first time a teacher is hostile towards students, it may be the first time in the college that it was particularly one student, but hostile towards students is not a new thing when it comes to this college. My constitution class, a class I’m required to take to graduate, he said that nobody is getting above a C even if there are no errors. if you get a 100% on the test, that will be graded as a C. he had his reasons, he told it was the combat grade inflation. this class in my college is infamous for being the worst class anyone will ever take at the college. And I didn’t even take the full class. I was there for three class days before I decided I would take my chances with the online class. I know, for not reporting this case, but for reporting anything on the campus of that puts you in jeopardy. This one made headlines so maybe you’ll figure out which college I’m going to. But there is a person who whistle on someone who waits a bunch of female students at my college. So what the school mandated her to do is to always sit by him in the classes she shared with him. They forced her to do this. she was lucky in the case that it made headlines, other cases that happen at this college are very much under reported. <br><br>Confronted with this, I decided not to step up. After all, the Internet is a vast place so I’m sure I can find someone who can help me with any problem I might have. This is resulted in me having to learn the material through online sources rather than through the class. This frustrates me because I’m the only student who’s doing it. No other student feels like they are threatened when asking questions. my answer to this question is to listen. If he wants me to stop asking questions, I stop asking questions.<br><br>Finally, this is what I’m trying to get at and why this actually relates to the video. I know I shouldn’t be judged on how I look, but I will be. The sad answer that I have come to is that I have to assimilate. if my weight becomes an issue, I will take on that dating method not because it’s healthy but because to not do so risk my job and my livelihood. I don’t know how far I will take this and I hope I don’t have to take it far. I hope that I don’t half to be put on such a severe diet, but it’s a possibility. I am a woman, and my worth is based on my looks. The same way it is right here all the way more noticeably.<br><br>But I don’t want to assimilate. After all, I am being dishonest with who I actually am when I try to fit a box. but right now I don’t see any actual solution. The ones that are typically suggested is in this video. Beautiful should be everyone, but everyone doesn’t see beautiful as beautiful. They will treat me differently based on whether I can fit the beauty standard of what ever industry I’m going in. Yes, I could work at a gas station but even there this beauty standards are applied. they might be the most loose, but they’re still there. as someone who worked at the gas station employee. do you know another hair color that I really would like to have? Pink. But, I was unsure how I was gonna rock it so I got a wig first. I got treated so differently not because they could tell it’s a wig. They thought I got my hair done and I was told that. So they did believe it was my hair dyed, but I was treated so much worse just for having that on. Even if they could tell it was a wig, isn’t everyone beautiful? I did expressed at least a small part of myself, my favorite color is pink. also, as everyone is stated, minimum wage is not minimum to live. I must get a job that will actually be able to support myself or I will die because I didn’t have enough money to pay rent. I already have college debt, so I really really hope I get in the industry.; These are rookie numbers they need to look at high school wrestling in the 90s.  &quot;Put on 10 trash bags and go run 3 miles&quot;  fuck yea!; Did you seriously say in the beginning that k pop introduced you to hip hop. As if k pop itself wasn’t modeled after hip hop???; this is such an amazing video; Celebrity worship is a mental disorder; Thank you so much ❤ I appreciate your work 💟; hear me out.. if ur audience gets triggered by all those things u keep warning them about.. its not ur problem.. dont. make. people. soft.; how can kpop destroy your confidence lmao. Those people are so 🤮 and constantly get surgery because they&#39;re not gifted.  thank goodness i actually have well defined features. Sucks to be them i guess; Are girls really that impressionable? I’m a guy that doesn’t fit the ideal, but it doesn’t bother me one bit when I watch male kpop groups.; It’s not just the surgeries but they have excessive filters for both pictures and videos. Their cameras have built in filters; kpop HAS destroyed my body image. now i cannot look at even fit people or myself and think &quot;so fat&quot;; All three i picked were non visuals lol😂; Exercise and healghy diet. Dont cut your bones for others appproval, dont cut your flesh for looking good bug pose serious life threats while going through immense pain; I would love to know how many times Momo has been reprimanded by her agency just for being brutally honest about that ice cube “diet” story; the thing that really pisses me off as someone who likes a few kpop groups and has been dealing with an ed is idols messaging their fans every time they gain weight (with the exact measurements ofc) and then telling everyone what their diet is and saying &quot;it&#39;s in order for you to like the way i look&quot;<br>and then the same people are telling their fans not to starve themselves and that they&#39;re pretty no matter what<br>i do understand that dieting and looks play a huge role in kpop but if you&#39;re an idol and you&#39;re against it why spread it among your fans??; Honestly, this is why I hate the concept of „having a bias“. Can we please appreciate everyone and not automatically start ranking people 🤯; thank you for speaking on this, People will preach that kpop diets r harmful but turn around and say &quot;oh my god! yeojin &amp; wonyoung body goals&quot; like theyre not women who have been on harmful diets since their early teens.; I literally chose the opposite of every visual position 😂; in North Korea, you lose weight because of tyranny<br>in South Korea, you lose weight because of chasing trend; For me, it is my acne/acne scars. My hormones are not working the way they are supposed to, and I cannot use medication to fix my hormones or clear my acne. I have tried in the past and paid the prize with an eye that could not function properly for a year due to the side effects of medicines. I guess I will just live with this for the rest of my life.; TW:ED<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this video comforted me. As a K-pop fan since I was 7 years old, I was greatly influenced. I started changing up the way I dressed and my style; basically, K-pop was my style my whole life. Then, as the years went by, I got so obsessed with K-pop that I  thought that they were the most &quot;perfect&quot; people and really wanted to even look like them, and I would look at myself in the mirror and think that I was really ugly and &quot;fat,&quot; even though I really wasn&#39;t. When I was 10 and turning 11, I started becoming more insecure about how I looked, and slowly I started to eat even less. On top of that, some kids, as well as my teacher at my school, lowered my self-esteem and confidence and would say that I was ugly, awkward, and all kinds of stuff. Then, a month after I turned 11, I started calorie counting, constantly lying to my parents that I ate my lunch and breakfast, and then I would have to forcefully eat dinner because my parents would be around at that time. At that time, WIEIAD videos were really trending, and I never realized how little calories they were eating at that time, but I still followed them. I even shortened the size of the plate I used as well as my cultilary, to the point where I would literally eat with teaspoons. Every day, I would wake up, my bones would hurt, I felt like I could pass out anytime, I felt no energy to do anything at all, and I would also get triggered easily. I was always tired and cold; most of the time I was lonely; I would never talk to anyone; I would give an attitude to my parents; and after realizing what I did, I feel really bad now, to be honest. Then I started having a bunch of hair grow on my back, face, and arms, and my hands started turning purple. Every time I would eat something and even drink some water, my stomach would be so painful that I couldn&#39;t even walk properly. One day, things got really bad; I even lost my period, and I told my parents. I was sent to the hospital; I was diagnosed with anorexia; and I had my vitals done and stuff. Turns out, I was underweight, my heartbeat was running at 46 bpm, my blood sugar level and blood pressure were extremely low, nurses would watch me eat all the time, I wasn&#39;t even allowed to walk, I always had to be on a wheel chair, as well as not being able to go to the washroom. I stayed there for 3–4 months. Now, I&#39;m an outpatient. I turned 12, which has been going on for basically a year, and I still haven&#39;t gotten my period back. From time to time, I skip meals because I feel like I gained weight, and I would try to vomit what I ate. I&#39;m 96 pounds, 12 years old, and 156 cm, whereas when I was anorexic, I was 72 pounds, 11 years old, and 153cm. Honestly, I still struggle with loving myself and having confidence, and I even wish that I were anorexic again. I still look in the mirror and think I&#39;m so ugly, and I would rather not wake up the following day than see myself again. I wish that I would look like those pretty K-pop idols with such great bodies, but this video you made helped me realize that they are also starving themselves and only pretty due to plastic surgery and all the Photoshop, so thank you.; I come back to this video from time to time as a reminder. As a girl that has been everywhere from having a green tint to my skin from starvation to being right below a morbidly obese qualification, having a healthy perspective on food and what &#39;healthy&#39; really is can sometimes be hard to maintain. I got into k pop I think 4 years ago now, and it&#39;s hard to not compare myself (a short, chunky, normal-faced person lol) to every idol I see. <br><br>Videos like this really help people like me, but even more importantly help spread the knowledge that these beauty standards we see in idols are almost always constructed - they are not naturally occurring all in a single person, let alone an entire industry full of them. Beauty is subjective, and no one needs to feel like they have to fit into a tiny, VERY specific box of qualities just to be beautiful. Thanks for a great video!; remember these guys are IDOLS. which means people look up to them and idolize them. Then the appearance standards must be higher than an average person&#39;s looks. In short, they have to stand out. As brutal as it sounds, this career is not for the weak-hearted. Similar to a body trainer, you have to train your boy to look good in front of the audience. If you don&#39;t like it, then do not be a K-pop star. there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.; I always bias people based on preference as in personality not visuals because everyone including fans is beautiful in their own way…but with me unfortunately so many people don’t believe that. Just love yourself first and then you will learn to love others; I don&#39;t care what people might say to this but... THE DANCES ARE HORRIBLE. this is not dancing at all just random movement of limbs and just too much. I personally prefer street dancing instead since the movement isn&#39;t desperate for attention but just free; I literally have never heard any of their songs and not even interested when I know personally that most Koreans don&#39;t look like that. It&#39;s called plastic surgery, beauty enhancements and a lot of training to be that way to influence the society.; This is the main reason why I stopped listening to kpop :(; Y&#39;all i have a doubt<br>My skin irl looks different from my neck like my face is lighter and my neck is a Lil dark than my face but sometimes it&#39;s like my face is darker than my neck so does it mean that I got edited irl 💀🤸🏻‍♀️; I get it, like beauty standards are different. I live in the USA and came from Korea. My beauty standards arent popular in the USA. In the USA, we want sharper brows, bigger lips, small noses, big chests, more weight, big butts. But on the other side in Korea, its different. So just look in the mirror, look at your face, dont change it, god gave you a face no one else has, love yourself, we all have our own beauty, it doesnt matter if someone else is &quot;prettier&quot; just know that you are too and you shouldnt ever look at yourself and say &quot;oh I&#39;m not beautiful&quot; you are!; I have a body that will be perfect for female kbs, but im a boy...; I tried to see you video!  however I couldn’t…… sorry; i was wondering if you were going to mention mamamoo! so glad you did (in a subtle way). they&#39;re inspirational to me. <br>great video! so much work was put into this and it shows. this is an important topic, and i&#39;m glad you brought attention to it in a gracious and balanced way.; kpop has made some girls who would otherwise be my type become skinny ghouls that are so weak and unhealthy they can’t even do a single pull up; I don’t see any bodies that are destroyed all gorgeous; The way you focus your last argument is really inspiring. I look at myself everyday and I find in the mirror the person who takes me places, who takes care of my body and soul, who dances while doing the dishes and whom I love and defend above anything in the world. Loving oneself doesn&#39;t need justification, it comes naturally to everyone, that&#39;s why we hate being criticized, so all we need to do (without falling in the narcissistic mode) is remember how lucky we are, and count our many blessings.; About 30 minutes ago I wanted to be a K-pop idol, and now? I still do but I&#39;m slowly losing interest in becoming an idol, I thought about trying out for different companies (the ones I wanted to try out for were SM,YG and HYBE) I was trying to lose weight so I didn&#39;t eat for 3 days, until my mom found out that I wasn&#39;t eating and I had to eat in front of her because she didn&#39;t trust me anymore. During the time I didn&#39;t eat I felt very weak, dizzy, depressed and nauseous, on top of that I also was also practicing my dancing and singing while not eating so that made me feel worse.<br><br>A little more context: I&#39;m 15 and my original weight was 192 now I&#39;m 173, and no I didn&#39;t drop 21 pounds in 3 days, I was using different apps to help myself lose weight while still eating one small snack a day BEFORE I stopped eating completely. <br><br>PLEASE DONT TRY THE METHOD I USED!! (it does NOT feel good, nor is it worth it I just wanted to share my story and maybe help someone else who&#39;s going through something similar!); I struggled with the first quiz, because I honestly couldn’t choose who was most beautiful 😅; tbh, I have tried more extreme diets. I&#39;ve lived off a tomato and 2 tbsp of sauerkraut before, lol.  I loved your video because it is so well put together and I think you make many great points.  I will say this though: we will never give up those standards because it is not so much about vanity.  It&#39;s about stopping the crazy stuff going on in our minds.  In addition, we all know that looks and our bodies do matter and when people say it doesn&#39;t, they sound patronising. Peace be with you.; I&#39;ve wanted to be a k-pop idol, just the idea of dancing and singing for a living is a dream to me, but I&#39;ve always been chubby. When I first get into k-pop I was aware that i wasn&#39;t k-pop idol pretty which makes me feel really bad about myself at the time at least. I still find myself comparing myself to others.. I wish  the mentality around  k-pop changes for more diversity and self love.<br><br>I won&#39;t give up on my dreams just yet though, I know it gonna be hard but i will find my way to it :) ( I know it sounds corny lol and also excuse my English as it is not my first language).; YUP when guys say they like kpop girls theyre so healthy i roll my eyes and say theyre anorexic mate. i my self am anorexic, had to have medications to fatten me up; If you ever saw a Korean nose job and know how it looks you’ll see more than half of Korean idols (actors, singers etc) have very similar nose job. It is not ugly but ever since realizing and just looking 3 seconds and being able to tell “oh they got a nose job” I realized there is no need for me to envy them as much. Of course just a nose doesn’t makes u automatically pretty, but just the fact that so many get the same looking nose it’s kind of funny; Every single time i try to watch a video like this about actual issues it always ends up being an ugly lazy &quot;everyone is beautiful&quot; girl😂; In the end she puts up pictures of ugly people and goes &quot;i think theyre ALL beautiful&quot; <br><br>Tells you everything you need to know about the delusional fools who make such videos; As an asian I don&#39;t see any idol attractive cause everyone looks the same. Nothing special or unique.

People constantly dig up photos of idols during their pre-debut days and debate on whether or not it&#39;s plastic surgery or just styling (make-up, double eyelid tape, etc.); starving is one thing

Lmao; SO glad I&#39;m old, happily wed and content with my wrinkles, old woman skin and entirely natural old age look. Seriously, life&#39;s too short for this sh*t...; HE IS A ONCE🔥🔥; So basically it&#39;s virtual makeup 😂; Nicr; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WM1SfHQqnY&amp;t=441"">7:21</a> I remembered Kim Kardashian being asked what she thinks about reinforcing unattainable beautu standards and she answered &quot;if I can do it than it&#39;s attainable&quot; like everyone has the access she has and like it&#39;s not all an ilusion made for digital media 😅; People are being reduced to avatars and usernames and, sadly, they see nothing wrong with the idea that the only desired beauty standard is one that’s totally unrealistic and superficial.  Practically no one is interested in cultivating a personality or nurturing a talent or skill, they simply want to “ look beautiful”.<br><br>P.S. Mucho Kudos to those of us who are secure enough to be ourselves and not blindly dive into current social “standards” that do nothing but promote self-hate and dissociation.; Garcia George Brown Eric Johnson Cynthia; The good news is someone who loves you will love the real you and doesn’t need the yasified filter you.; We all has a mirror , i quite know my own beauty n flaws and also everyone , so .. the effort to represent  &quot; beauty standard of our own is our bussiness &quot; <br>Either how we want to appear inside n out side r not to get gudged by anyone ... If you like it or not keep it to your self. <br>I said it to my self .. I only consider with the religion n government law standard according to &quot; beauty standard &quot; in outfit nothing more.; This is honestly like that mirror from Harry Potter, where many people have wasted most of their lives staring at themselves in a fantasy. Get rid of all social media, and you will be much happier.; I hate hate haaate seeing my face with beauty filters. It looks so so wrong. I remember I was out to lunch with friends and we took a group selfie. They had a beauty filter on and I started laughing because I looked so fucking weird! My visceral reaction is “oh my god ew who the fuck is that????”; i am a portrait/model artist. i teach. i studied old and new beauty standards for anything that was commited to a visual medium. i&#39;ve drawn hundreds of people and nude bodies of all ages, genders and ethnicities.<br><br>you look fine. the way your body moves and rolls and hangs is fine. your neckline is fine. your face looks fine. you are not as fat as you think. your legs are not too skinny.<br><br>i&#39;ve had models tell me they&#39;ve felt less judged naked and surrounded by artists than fully clothed in the streets. the gaze of others can truly hurt. artists train to see things as they are*, as close as you can to truth. we learn very early that judgement and the brain lies to you by design. lenses and gazes lie. they can distort reality heavily - because of judgement or physics. the habit of taking selfies with a phone so close to a face makes us used to see our face distorted, features of the face enlarged and everything around it curved and minimized. we&#39;re basically training ourselves to see lies as truth, judgement as fact.<br><br>pictures lies. lenses and eyes distort. light is everything and that&#39;s why you are so depressed after looking at yourself in the bathroom mirror. <br><br><br><br>i&#39;ve never been kinder than when i draw someone.<br><br><br>(*of course it&#39;s one school of thought ao not every artist will be like this); I’ve straight up had to stop meeting people through the internet. If you are of such a weak character that you have difficulty differentiating between yourself and an illustration based on yourself, then you literally haven’t done the work to obtain sapience. Those who use these filters are too mentally and emotionally stunted to be able to provide informed consent in the same exact way that prevents kindergartners from getting bank loans.; I think looking like a porcelain doll will became a symdrom; I took really nice pro looking pictures of my sister once.. When she got the pictures she said I should basically quit my job on it and just take pictures of animals. They where cool pictures but couldn&#39;t compete with her AI obsession, which I was trying to make a point about but evidently failed. It&#39;s making her feel really self continues in an unhealthy way as she gets older :(<br>It&#39;s an annoying problem just generally as a photographer. I want to show the beauty and coolness of the real people, with any &quot;flaws&quot; helping describe them..  I keep away from filters and photoshop, though I do unsharpened pictures a little..  no one needs to see every pore that modern cameras can convey.. not like anyone in real life is standing that close to inspect pores in real life lol; Are you cosplaying?; I’m 57. My mother said when I was a kid “when a couple that have had their teeth done and nose jobs don’t be surprised what their kid looks like”<br>If she only knew what the future would hold!; I had a friend who would not and could not leave her house without wearing makeup. It was low-key frightening and helped me not fall into the trap of makeup. <br><br>It has pros and cons - we expect makeup for a woman to ‘look professional’ and the lack of it can send the message that the person is lazy, sloppy or unkempt. But, I save so much money and don’t flinch from my own reflection like my friend did, so for me it’s a good outcome. <br><br>With filters like this? ….i have to work out what kind of job never needs or wants to see you in person.; The food is poison and women no longer have any self discipline.; It affects you more if you live like in San Diego..LA.. mostly california. And I guess miami. Reasons im getting out of here and moving back to my home state lol; Gonna be an implant one day that filters people’s face and body irl and Shallow Hal everyone you look at lol. Touch is gonna be the only tell until they come up with the tech for that too. Sounds like a Black Mirror episode.; I lost you when you started blaming ‘liberals’ (and I’m not even one).  Lol.  Rabble rabble rabble; I’m glad I never fell into the filterverse. Still do my same simple makeup routine I’ve done since I was 18, and I’m 43 now. I still look fabulous, never use things that make me look unrealistic. No filters, fillers, contouring or hair dye. To much makeup or crazy filters just make women look like they are in drag. Young women need to learn less is more, but not being lazy and putting in a bit of effort can go a long way.; Felix looks so cute without makeup with the freckles jyp still tries to hide; The filtered versions eyebrows look so frozen....similar to Catherine&#39;s eyebrows in the &#39;cancer&#39; video.; Culpa do Culto à Feiura; OK I’m old so somebody explain to me if these kids are putting these filters on, on social media to meet people what are they going to do when they actually have to meet in person? Or do they just perpetually have a virtual relationship so they never have to see one another’s actual faces? 🫤; They were always ugly. You simply didn&#39;t look closely enough.; Greatest closing line ever.; I never use filters. They look silly and disingenuous.; Why does everyone want a pointed nose? It looks gross, like you&#39;re gonna poke my eye out.; might just be me, but I prefer the faces without filters. sure, they may not be as conventionlly attractive, but their features are more diverse. the filters make them all look oddly similar, with the same brows, contour, and snatched jawlines. I prefer the diversity of natural faces, how each face is unique, and I think that has it&#39;s own appeal; What was up with that comment about liberals?; I&#39;ve absolutely refused to use filters on principle alone.; The second picture is not ugly. It’s just not airbrushed with a bunch of makeup gunked on top. It’s how beauty should be.; Oh come on, 5 years ago AI art was a joke. Now it&#39;s making all the art for card games, companies are using it for models, it&#39;s creating entire ad campaigns. The hands are still a giveaway, but for how long?; Ugly people? There is no such thing.; How we look and view ourselves is so messed up now. I can’t see it ending though.; Ask yourselves who benefits from making you feel inadequate? Answer: 1) the floggers of unnecessary products and 2) those operating systems of power and control. Dear young people, please fight back against this poison!; Beauty filters would have made an outstanding Twilight Zone theme had someone thought of them sixty years ago.; Can you stop speaking like a cheap  AI voice app?; That’s why everyone on the internet looks the same. It’s all a filler.; This would be like Pandora’s box for me. It would be so hard knowing what I COULD look like but never will. 😭; I always saw through the filters and cosmetic surgery. Most people are normal looking, not exotic. Unfortunately my face looks purchased, so I’ve been asked throughout my life what I’ve gotten done lol. It’s been a wild ride. It’s also sad how easily influenced people are. Most girls on IG modify their pictures. Or pose only while sticking out their a$$. When you’re my age almost 38, you’ve been able to see the shift in social media and how shallow it became. I remember when KYLIE JENNER LOOKED LIKE KYLIE JENNER okkkya 😂 she was never beautiful and that’s why she redid her face. We just need to stop idolizing her and others when that’s not their natural self. Period.; I use filters in my photos I make, mostly places and now my kid but I’m talking about filters that add that artistic touch through light tones etc. I would be embarrassed to use other type of filters; Capitalist beauty standards are so boring; Filters have changed things, but not for the better.  It’s also becoming the norm.  <br><br>Because filters have become the norm, I often get this reaction when people meet me - “oh my goodness, you look EXACTLY like your pictures”.  I don’t use filters in my pictures or videos.  The only editing that I may use in my pictures is lighting adjustments, but I don’t do any tuning to my face, hair or body.; This is why I have always stayed away from beauty filters. I realized it would distort how I see myself, which isn’t always through the best lens anyway, and I’d never be happy with how I look without plastic surgery. Unfortunately, I’d agree my definition of beauty still has been greatly altered, but I’m plastic surgery free, so goal achieved I guess.; Nice hair, I know it’s a little ironic when this is on looks but it looks good man.; WHAT CONTACTS ARE YOU WEARING?! Please. Lol i struggle so gard to find contacts that look natural on dark eyes.; if noone wants to see human faces anymore, we might aswell wear helmets...<br><br><br><br><i>BRING BACK MEDIEVAL HELMETS LESGO</i>; Who says Liberals want AI?  I&#39;m Liberal,  and I don&#39;t want AI.; Reality: SKIN HAS TEXTURE; Hands are so hard to draw, even AI can&#39;t do it. 💀; This nonsense is absolutely messing with my BDD. That&#39;s why my friend and me only use extra ugly filters now, so we can feel good about our natural self.; Joi; Update: the hands issue was fixed a while ago; I refuse to use filters; Ummm idk if it’s working right but i just tried the bold glamour filter, and i look exactly the same? Lol; Damn my (Chinese) mom constantly tells me that going out without looking your best is rude. Unfortunately we have polar opposite ideas of what that means; Go to Costco on a Monday and Saturday, you&#39;re going to see all natural things; That plants vs zombies theme goes so hard; Thank you; Whenever I open Tik tok or Instagram, I am always feel I am ugly, people there have perfect skin, perfect face features, flawless hair etc, I literally compared myself to filtered, photoshop-ed, edited, stranger in the internet, but once I touch grass, I am not that ugly, I look normal, I don&#39;t need to look prettiest, I am just need to look normal compared to other<br>Older generation (usually in their 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s) tend to compliment me a lot, saying I look pretty compare to other, I guess my face check their beauty standard at that time, and it really boost my confidence, thankyou :); Gen A is doomed; :); “And a SHEIN-“ <b>shein ad plays</b> “jumpsuit”; Makes me laugh at the people who use the filters and then when they meet the person they run.; Bold glamour makes me look too perfect, its very fake looking. I dont quite get why we are feeding each others insecurity; As a portrait painter, hands are the master test.; When you mention symmetry and how symmetry between two halves of the face is what makes us attractive; I don’t think that’s what it means. I think it’s based on harmony between the features, the golden ratio style. A beautiful face can be asymmetric, but still as beautiful.; I’ve never understood the appeal of having “perfect” skin. <br>Seeing imperfections is more attractive imo; Sorry, but: minus 500 Karma points for that &quot;jump-scared herself&quot; joke, because it hits right into the &quot;oh no aged skin is hideous&quot;  trend that (I think?) you&#39;re trying to be against. <br>Hard to say with a short glitch, but I&#39;d say she looks bloody amazing for a 55 yo woman. It&#39;s a pity that she feels that she needs to use filters, but comments like that are exactly <i>why</i> people use filters. <br>And obviously: since female celebrities almost inevitably look beautiful, it feels even more inexcusable to them to &#39;only&#39; look good.; I rarely use filters. They just seem like a lie.; The fact that most average looking people now days are considered ugly shows us that the standards are too unnatural to the point where we can’t even distinct what humans are actually supposed to look like.; Algorithm ❤; Hi tanjiro; I wonder if some people will now make their relatives film and filter their wedding photos instead of hiring make-up artists and photographers?; How do you get these filters? Do they cost alot?; I’m 52, hate the feel of skin makeup, and have only ever used a filter once, to see what it could do. It turned me into an East Asian teenager. It was creepy. I prefer to appear as me.; I think this why I try not to fool myself with filters and just take normal photos with very minimal softening and all that.. like I can see my own pores.. but this is what I look like no? 🤣","The Downfall of Normal Beauty Standards The first 1000 people to click my link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare: https://skl.sh/edvasian03231 » socials ...

Practically no one is interested in cultivating a personality or nurturing a talent or skill, they simply want to “ look beautiful”.<br><br>P.S. Mucho Kudos to those of us who are secure enough to be ourselves and not blindly dive into current social “standards” that do nothing but promote self-hate and dissociation.; Garcia George Brown Eric Johnson Cynthia; The good news is someone who loves you will love the real you and doesn’t need the yasified filter you.; We all has a mirror , i quite know my own beauty n flaws and also everyone , so .. the effort to represent  &quot; beauty standard of our own is our bussiness &quot; <br>Either how we want to appear inside n out side r not to get gudged by anyone ... If you like it or not keep it to your self. <br>I said it to my self .. I only consider with the religion n government law standard according to &quot; beauty standard &quot; in outfit nothing more.; This is honestly like that mirror from Harry Potter, where many people have wasted most of their lives staring at themselves in a fantasy. Get rid of all social media, and you will be much happier.; I hate hate haaate seeing my face with beauty filters. It looks so so wrong. I remember I was out to lunch with friends and we took a group selfie. They had a beauty filter on and I started laughing because I looked so fucking weird! My visceral reaction is “oh my god ew who the fuck is that????”; i am a portrait/model artist. i teach. i studied old and new beauty standards for anything that was commited to a visual medium. i&#39;ve drawn hundreds of people and nude bodies of all ages, genders and ethnicities.<br><br>you look fine. the way your body moves and rolls and hangs is fine. your neckline is fine. your face looks fine. you are not as fat as you think. your legs are not too skinny.<br><br>i&#39;ve had models tell me they&#39;ve felt less judged naked and surrounded by artists than fully clothed in the streets. the gaze of others can truly hurt. artists train to see things as they are*, as close as you can to truth. we learn very early that judgement and the brain lies to you by design. lenses and gazes lie. they can distort reality heavily - because of judgement or physics. the habit of taking selfies with a phone so close to a face makes us used to see our face distorted, features of the face enlarged and everything around it curved and minimized. we&#39;re basically training ourselves to see lies as truth, judgement as fact.<br><br>pictures lies. lenses and eyes distort. light is everything and that&#39;s why you are so depressed after looking at yourself in the bathroom mirror. <br><br><br><br>i&#39;ve never been kinder than when i draw someone.<br><br><br>(*of course it&#39;s one school of thought ao not every artist will be like this); I’ve straight up had to stop meeting people through the internet. If you are of such a weak character that you have difficulty differentiating between yourself and an illustration based on yourself, then you literally haven’t done the work to obtain sapience. Those who use these filters are too mentally and emotionally stunted to be able to provide informed consent in the same exact way that prevents kindergartners from getting bank loans.; I think looking like a porcelain doll will became a symdrom; I took really nice pro looking pictures of my sister once.. When she got the pictures she said I should basically quit my job on it and just take pictures of animals. They where cool pictures but couldn&#39;t compete with her AI obsession, which I was trying to make a point about but evidently failed. It&#39;s making her feel really self continues in an unhealthy way as she gets older :(<br>It&#39;s an annoying problem just generally as a photographer. I want to show the beauty and coolness of the real people, with any &quot;flaws&quot; helping describe them..  I keep away from filters and photoshop, though I do unsharpened pictures a little..  no one needs to see every pore that modern cameras can convey.. not like anyone in real life is standing that close to inspect pores in real life lol; Are you cosplaying?; I’m 57. My mother said when I was a kid “when a couple that have had their teeth done and nose jobs don’t be surprised what their kid looks like”<br>If she only knew what the future would hold!; I had a friend who would not and could not leave her house without wearing makeup. It was low-key frightening and helped me not fall into the trap of makeup. <br><br>It has pros and cons - we expect makeup for a woman to ‘look professional’ and the lack of it can send the message that the person is lazy, sloppy or unkempt. But, I save so much money and don’t flinch from my own reflection like my friend did, so for me it’s a good outcome. <br><br>With filters like this? ….i have to work out what kind of job never needs or wants to see you in person.; The food is poison and women no longer have any self discipline.; It affects you more if you live like in San Diego..LA.. mostly california.

Rabble rabble rabble; I’m glad I never fell into the filterverse. Still do my same simple makeup routine I’ve done since I was 18, and I’m 43 now. I still look fabulous, never use things that make me look unrealistic. No filters, fillers, contouring or hair dye. To much makeup or crazy filters just make women look like they are in drag. Young women need to learn less is more, but not being lazy and putting in a bit of effort can go a long way.; Felix looks so cute without makeup with the freckles jyp still tries to hide; The filtered versions eyebrows look so frozen....similar to Catherine&#39;s eyebrows in the &#39;cancer&#39; video.; Culpa do Culto à Feiura; OK I’m old so somebody explain to me if these kids are putting these filters on, on social media to meet people what are they going to do when they actually have to meet in person? Or do they just perpetually have a virtual relationship so they never have to see one another’s actual faces? 🫤; They were always ugly. You simply didn&#39;t look closely enough.; Greatest closing line ever.; I never use filters. They look silly and disingenuous.; Why does everyone want a pointed nose? It looks gross, like you&#39;re gonna poke my eye out.; might just be me, but I prefer the faces without filters. sure, they may not be as conventionlly attractive, but their features are more diverse. the filters make them all look oddly similar, with the same brows, contour, and snatched jawlines. I prefer the diversity of natural faces, how each face is unique, and I think that has it&#39;s own appeal; What was up with that comment about liberals?; I&#39;ve absolutely refused to use filters on principle alone.; The second picture is not ugly. It’s just not airbrushed with a bunch of makeup gunked on top. It’s how beauty should be.; Oh come on, 5 years ago AI art was a joke. Now it&#39;s making all the art for card games, companies are using it for models, it&#39;s creating entire ad campaigns. The hands are still a giveaway, but for how long?; Ugly people? There is no such thing.; How we look and view ourselves is so messed up now. I can’t see it ending though.; Ask yourselves who benefits from making you feel inadequate? Answer: 1) the floggers of unnecessary products and 2) those operating systems of power and control. Dear young people, please fight back against this poison!; Beauty filters would have made an outstanding Twilight Zone theme had someone thought of them sixty years ago.; Can you stop speaking like a cheap  AI voice app?; That’s why everyone on the internet looks the same. It’s all a filler.; This would be like Pandora’s box for me. It would be so hard knowing what I COULD look like but never will. 😭; I always saw through the filters and cosmetic surgery. Most people are normal looking, not exotic. Unfortunately my face looks purchased, so I’ve been asked throughout my life what I’ve gotten done lol. It’s been a wild ride. It’s also sad how easily influenced people are. Most girls on IG modify their pictures. Or pose only while sticking out their a$$. When you’re my age almost 38, you’ve been able to see the shift in social media and how shallow it became. I remember when KYLIE JENNER LOOKED LIKE KYLIE JENNER okkkya 😂 she was never beautiful and that’s why she redid her face. We just need to stop idolizing her and others when that’s not their natural self. Period.; I use filters in my photos I make, mostly places and now my kid but I’m talking about filters that add that artistic touch through light tones etc. I would be embarrassed to use other type of filters; Capitalist beauty standards are so boring; Filters have changed things, but not for the better.  It’s also becoming the norm.  <br><br>Because filters have become the norm, I often get this reaction when people meet me - “oh my goodness, you look EXACTLY like your pictures”.  I don’t use filters in my pictures or videos.  The only editing that I may use in my pictures is lighting adjustments, but I don’t do any tuning to my face, hair or body.; This is why I have always stayed away from beauty filters. I realized it would distort how I see myself, which isn’t always through the best lens anyway, and I’d never be happy with how I look without plastic surgery. Unfortunately, I’d agree my definition of beauty still has been greatly altered, but I’m plastic surgery free, so goal achieved I guess.; Nice hair, I know it’s a little ironic when this is on looks but it looks good man.; WHAT CONTACTS ARE YOU WEARING?!

Unfortunately we have polar opposite ideas of what that means; Go to Costco on a Monday and Saturday, you&#39;re going to see all natural things; That plants vs zombies theme goes so hard; Thank you; Whenever I open Tik tok or Instagram, I am always feel I am ugly, people there have perfect skin, perfect face features, flawless hair etc, I literally compared myself to filtered, photoshop-ed, edited, stranger in the internet, but once I touch grass, I am not that ugly, I look normal, I don&#39;t need to look prettiest, I am just need to look normal compared to other<br>Older generation (usually in their 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s) tend to compliment me a lot, saying I look pretty compare to other, I guess my face check their beauty standard at that time, and it really boost my confidence, thankyou :); Gen A is doomed; :); “And a SHEIN-“ <b>shein ad plays</b> “jumpsuit”; Makes me laugh at the people who use the filters and then when they meet the person they run.; Bold glamour makes me look too perfect, its very fake looking. I dont quite get why we are feeding each others insecurity; As a portrait painter, hands are the master test.; When you mention symmetry and how symmetry between two halves of the face is what makes us attractive; I don’t think that’s what it means. I think it’s based on harmony between the features, the golden ratio style. A beautiful face can be asymmetric, but still as beautiful.; I’ve never understood the appeal of having “perfect” skin. <br>Seeing imperfections is more attractive imo; Sorry, but: minus 500 Karma points for that &quot;jump-scared herself&quot; joke, because it hits right into the &quot;oh no aged skin is hideous&quot;  trend that (I think?) you&#39;re trying to be against. <br>Hard to say with a short glitch, but I&#39;d say she looks bloody amazing for a 55 yo woman. It&#39;s a pity that she feels that she needs to use filters, but comments like that are exactly <i>why</i> people use filters. <br>And obviously: since female celebrities almost inevitably look beautiful, it feels even more inexcusable to them to &#39;only&#39; look good.; I rarely use filters. They just seem like a lie.; The fact that most average looking people now days are considered ugly shows us that the standards are too unnatural to the point where we can’t even distinct what humans are actually supposed to look like.; Algorithm ❤; Hi tanjiro; I wonder if some people will now make their relatives film and filter their wedding photos instead of hiring make-up artists and photographers?; How do you get these filters?

China’s Viral “Skinny Enough” Challenges Are Making People Sick | Gen 跟 China,VICE Asia,2022-03-31T15:34:19Z,The pressure to be thin is threatening the lives of some women in China. Being thin has always been a cultural beauty standard ...,qjKfx3az1kA,"Asians are deliberately underweight in order to woo white Americans.; Better then fat  people like 👍 🐖 🐖 🐖; My family first went to Shanghai when I was a teen and there were these complete strangers just giving unsolicited comments about my appearance. I was on a healthy BMI so i know i&#39;m not fat but a few strangers (mostly older men) just out of the blue would often tell me that i look heavy and that i should lose weight while i&#39;m young. i wanted to rebutt, &quot;i don&#39;t have to because i&#39;m on a healthy BMI&quot; but I reckoned they might not know or care about BMIs, also, they&#39;re gross to be having that rude interaction with a teen and I worried they might take any response as an invitation to engage or flirt so I just ignored them. <br><br>Luckily, i&#39;m no longer easily influenced by body trends because I&#39;ve experienced being both fat and skinny and i didn&#39;t feel beautiful in either. On one end, I&#39;ve been called a &quot;whale&quot;, on the other I&#39;ve been called a &quot;skeleton lollipop&quot; (because heads look bigger when the body is like a stick). I know now being within a healthy BMI is where i look best so even if someone would call me fat, it doesn&#39;t hurt because the opinion of a rude person i don&#39;t care about doesn&#39;t matter.; If China decides that way, most Asian countries will follow China&#39;s lead and do the same. That&#39;s why I think China can set thin people as the beauty standard for the whole world.; People should stop calling other people ugly.

Went back to death America food where we add sugar to all things and gained it back; Leave the last basin of not morbidly obese people alone this goes for men and women; I dont even have to try to be like them; Aren&#39;t East Asians depressed enough as it is? What with the expectation to excel in school from a very young age. What with the crazy competitive job market. What with the plummeting birth rates, because no one wants to have kids. What with young people committing suicide left right and center. Sure, add some useless beauty standards like a perfect cherry on top of a perfect shit sundae.; fking pathetic holy shit...; Iam a billion times thankful to be born in an amazing diverse, friendly and flexible country likw India🥹🥹🥹jai hind🙏; For goodness sake, people shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of their weight, especially (but not only) if they&#39;re only mildly overweight. I have personally learned to respond with a &quot;Fuck you!&quot; attitude to anyone who tries to fat-shame me. FWIW, I&#39;m currently 6 feet tall, weigh 195 pounds, and am a male. So, I&#39;m currently overweight but not obese. I&#39;m on topiramate to help deal with extreme hunger, and it actually helps me a lot! I don&#39;t feel chronically hungry anymore while I&#39;m on it, and I&#39;ve been on it ever since 2020 or 2021, I think.; leave asia alone. keep your western woke bs out of here. asians will deal with asia. not a perfect society but let us handle it; 니들은 좀 빼라. ㅈ나게 면상썩어 빠지고 부풀어 오른 것이 살빼기 귀찮아서 정당화하는 소리하지 말고; its funny, when we first see cindy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjKfx3az1kA&amp;t=161"">2:41</a>, my first thought was &quot;woah, she&#39;s so pretty&quot; haha i was so shocked when she said how people treated her. People are so harsh its scary; It is so sad that so many women, do not want to be affected , but we ALL ARE. We know weight should not be that important, but in our mind, during our grow up time, we are planted the idea of we can not be fat ,we need to be thinner. It can not be changed. It is frustrated. It is a typical sign that feminism is we weak in China. We do not have the rights to be in any weights in a peaceful mood. We are worried all the time. There is so much pain inside.; It&#39;s not just China, it&#39;s happening all over Asia.; many of the video use filter to make them thinner; There is no way Europeans are not realizing how half of these people are anorexic and have eating disorders, how ignorant; a small in Europe is an xl in China.. just for all the Europeans out there that seem to be pretty pissed off by this video. no… you’re not more superior retards; Omg!!!

How cool is that??? 如此惊人; Once I went with my Chinese friend to shop and i bought potato chips and asked him if he wanted some and he was like you get fat and i  spread laughing 😂; you are beautiful, F*UCK WHAT THEY ARE SAYING; I hate the fact that this documentary portrays everything that entails watching your weight being a disorder. In all cultures, women need to look after themselves, of course it should not escalate to eating disorders but if you are fat, you need to do something about it without being sick over it, coz even obesity has a HIGE price. SO positivity is not all that positive.; i think eating disorder is world wide problem, not limited to China.  Beauty is what people strived for.  It is the social capital, there is a lot of benefit to beauty.  Western countries had long touted thin = beautiful for women, muscular = beautiful for men.; Not enough mental disorders in China.

She could not convince the Chinese women athletes to participate in a weightlifting program.  They were afraid of putting on muscle.  It is considered ugly for an Asian female to appear buff and have obvious muscles, especially in their hips and legs.   Even the female Olympic athletes were afraid to put on muscle!; China in a toxic anorexia normcore trend like it&#39;s peak 2005 Victoria&#39;s Secret Paris Hilton Pink.; You are a special and unique person. Your life &amp; soul matter. Your life is very short compared to eternity. <br>Therefore if you want to spend eternity on heaven after your life here on earth 🌎,  you should believe in your heart ❤️ that Jesus Christ is your Savior. If you don&#39;t, you will miss going to heaven and end up in the lake of fire. It is terrible so I beg you to make the only correct decision for God to allow you to go to heaven. Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life. 🙏 Have a nice day. God does love ❤️ you.; Alex is so badass, she’s such an inspiration.; If I was this thin I’d probably constantly pass out during the day. 😂; Id say most Americans prefer a more athletic/natural look. Being too thin or too big isnt usually the standard; As a girl whose mom is filipino (southeast asian) and Chinese (East Asian), these habits shows that my mom shows are crazy. Ever since I was younger she would push me into loosing weight and encourages me to it aswell, I understand the body standards. My mom had an eating disorder building up. She and I did this diet together, we skipped breakfast, ate a boiled egg for lunch then for dinner it would be a salad but for my sake she would give me a small bowl of rice and vegetables. Not only was I not eating well I also had activities, ballet, dance, kumon, instruments and more. I was at the edge of fainting, o top of that they would over work me in ballet, such as pushing me to the limits and all of that. As for now my mom has somewhat recovered although I still think about how I look, my weight and all of that. My mom isn&#39;t at full fault at this, her family encouraged her on loosing weight and making sure she is fit. I hope that in the future no one experiences this problem. Im a teenager who has a problem on looks and the judgement of others, for people they see me as someone so skinny but in my eyes Im not good enough.; How is looking sickly attractive.

Just so you don’t have to deal with your mental illnesses. 😂😂 Totally collapsed society; It&#39;s odd that people see super skinny as desirable and marriage material when in fact it is the leading contributor to low birth rates. A woman needs at least 10% body fat to run necessary hormones properly. No hips, no breasts means no babies.; it&#39;s funny how I actually do fit in the skinny trend but since I live in India where I would say the beauty standard is rather like little skinny but not too much I always get called malnutrition, skinny, dried fish and what not. I tried doing the challenges as shown in the beginning of the video and couldn&#39;t that tells you I am not that skinny but still I get called skinny all the time and had really affected my self confidence at one point.; How bloody cruel do you have to be to call schoolgirls the &#39;ugliest girl group&#39;.; Wild that ppl would rather starve than work out lol; wow; i understand beauty standards, i am not asian/chinese but beauty standards for women are something i noted as us leaning more and more to child-like. and going into children stores adds to that for me. interested in hearing other opinions too. like shaving, and other norms too.; Come off it. 75% of Americans are overweight. 45% are obese. Yall are the unhealthy ones. Yall have just forgotten what a normal, healthy weight looks like.

TF...; no truer words have been uttered; stop using wony for thumbnail as if it was her pic with the injection scar; (Tw; ed) &quot;I would never compare myself to idols to an extent that it hurts my health&quot; i thought that same exact thing for years. I got into kpop in 2014 and from K4-graduation went to an international school with primarily Korean students so often times even though it was in the usa, kbs were def more popular. Schooling didnt effect me as much but with Kpop for the first few years i was fine, i then started comparing my face or my body to idols subtly, then not so subtly, until i was 19 (2021) when it turned into anirexia, im now 22 and i still struggle with all of these - anorexia, bullimia, body dysmorphia, etc. the reason i say this is you dont realize until its too late and you&#39;re already so deep in, im not saying kpop is the cause of my eating disorders as i know its not, though i will say seeing idols so thin and hearing so many diets absolutely contributed heavily; 😂I Loved all you, your all have a place in my Heart 😘; Lets get started <b>the ad started</b>; THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST EMBELLISHED AND UGLY; The only thing I hate about my self is my body hair but it was before I came in k pop; Never swaet <br><br>Hyunjin be like: 👁️👄👁️; Это видео brownie kpop?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=370"">6:10</a>.

I wonder what exercises they do to create such beautiful shoulders. Then came to know about the Botox which is also used in there 🤦🏻‍♀️ I was shocked.; <b>meanwhile hyunjin swetings like he come out of the sea</b>; yeah stop with the stupid fan fiction and focus on reality...oh and nice video.; Thank you for such an Informative and Wonderful Video that broke the myths and showed the dark sides of the KPop Industry and it&#39;s Worst Beauty Standards...; The real beauty is within your soul. If your soul is beautiful. Your physical will be automatically beautiful. ❤; I though they would also burn the sweat glandes with laser? miradry or smth like that is called?; We don&#39;t need to compare ourselves to them. Their life is different and young kids shoukd understand that.😊; WOW 😳; Fiance is a cosmetic surgeon in my country and a lot of the training seminars they&#39;re sent to are in South Korea, or they have South Koreans rhinoplasty specialists and other cosmetic surgeons come to conventions here to train other doctors. Some of the example photos they use are publicly available images of idols in different lighting (professional, candid, selfies etc) to show how certain implants or suture and lifting techniques can really flatter the face of celebrities and look imperceptible in different lighting. Even those you think are natural have had tweaks, whether it may be through filler or non invasive treatments like ulthera, exilys, onda, cryolipo, etc. Surgery also isn&#39;t so hard to recover from, it&#39;s not impossible that they&#39;ll have work done in between comebacks because you&#39;re technically presentable after a week for things like a rhinoplasty or blepheroplasty, you just need to keep taking the medications prescribed after the operation like antibiotics or anti inflammatory drugs. It&#39;s so much less obvious than people point out. <br><br>Another thing is that those idols who people like saying are &quot;all natural, because a nose like (idol) cannot be achieved by just anyone&quot; was a misinterpretation of a quote by a korean surgeon asked to comment on some idol&#39;s noses. Not everyone can accommodate having a high bridge even with surgery because the limiting factor is the amount of skin surrounding the area- while you can add height, it&#39;s not as easy to just add skin. So the famous &quot;natural&quot; noses like Miyeon, Sana, etc, have already been tweaked in some way but they had the benefit of having a higher bridge prior to their debut and peak, so it would be easier to add height from that point on.; &quot;Their armpits are lighter and cleaner than our future&quot;<br>Bro just roasted our armpits in 100 different languages...; I’m not a k-pop fan this video played on auto. But dark armpits are my worst insecurity. BOTOX for arm pits! Damn these girls work hard !; amazing video; I love how solar is just exposing the industry this whole video 😂😂; I would never change myself. I am so happy that I don’t need surgery and that I never DID THAT. I may be depressed, but I will never be insecure enough to get them :3; What&#39;s funny is Kpop fans (especially Koreans ofc) know that their beauty standards are downright unrealistic, but still continue to follow it anyway 🤦‍♂; That’s sad all that because they love music and dance; Waow people have become plastic; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=389"">6:29</a> yuna doesn’t wear hip pads; I&#39;m an American, I would never compare myself to unrealistic beauty standards. Personally I can&#39;t stand pale skin. I&#39;m Italian so I like olive skin. I don&#39;t compare myself to anyone. Only I have to be happy with myself. I don&#39;t care what others think!!!; I really hope many will watch and benefit from this video.  💙🙏🏻🕊🌞; that aoa pics are edited lol; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=2"">0:02</a> GOODBYE CUMMUNITY ☠️; “And they never sweat” hyunjin:💧👁👄👁💧; Dont do anything like this to see others because you are living your life not there 😮😮😢 i know there are a large pressure of beauty in this society 😢 but believe your natural beauty guys 😊😊; What is the use of fake beauty that will kill you inside of your body😳😳😏😏😏 no matter how you are your natural beauty is good for you ❤️❤️🥰❤️; &quot;My facial hair isnt coming back after doing laser hair removal&quot; <b>pikachu meme</b> you dont say?; he thought he ate the armpit joke in the beginning 🤣; They are brainwashing us just like they whitewash their skins; Aespa’s entire concept is about looking like ai with very little focus on talent or personality; WOW 😲😳😳 Only now i understand their &#39;perfection&#39;...🤭🤨🤢; I love your voice it is so sexy; Bleaching hair has got to be the worst thing to do. Might as well go to a salon even if the agency’s system disallows it.; idk why people blame others e.g society or fans or media when they are really doing to themselves whether bc they are want to stand out or self conscious also making other feel pressured. idols greedness and competitivness set these beauty standards.; for skin whitning I don&#39;t think they should bleach it as a asian who also loves light skin I do skin whitening remedies that are actaully healthy for your skin and remove bad bacteria why can&#39;t they just do the same<br>They mainly just remove the tan but most kpop idols are born fair so yeah I was also born fair but if your black you&#39;ll may end up black or dark brown not white; okay more misinformation. Koreans have a mutation that means some of them literally don&#39;t sweat and that most of them have odourless sweat. The antipersprant roller is what everyone who suffers from excessive sweating use as it stops the sweat glands for a certain amount of time. Botox injections are also very common for this type of condition so its really not that bad to use.; Honestly, watching this video, I felt SICK. I could barely hold my tears. Just tell me why? Why are the kpop companies torturing idols like this? The idols are living humans being for crying out loud. How can somebody do this to them? How?! How could they….People who run kpop companies are heartless inhumane pigs.; It&#39;s so weird to think that once you dedicate your life to this thing, there are professionals who look at you from head to toe, and point out a 100 things that you have to change in yourself.. how insecure that can make you feel, and then on top of that when a few years pass by, you realise people never really saw you for who you really are, instead loved you for a confirmed standard you attained surgery after surgery. I was a kpop fan back in 2017-2019, and we didn&#39;t really have videos like this that time, so I had no one to tell me how toxic everything is.. I struggled a lot with my body image, eventhough I am naturally thin.. it was really one of the worst times for me in that case. I don&#39;t know what I trying to be. Now I&#39;m older and healthier, and not a kpop fan anymore.; Just like hwasa said : i love my body❤; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=372"">6:12</a> спасибо за русские субтитры; Also, glutathione injections actually don’t really whiten your skin. It’s more that they brighten it, maybe making you a shade or two more fair. But to truly whiten the skin, there are more damaging or high risk methods that people use.; Instead of using hip pads, it’s more common now just to get Sculptra injections (as seen in ITZY’s Yuna and the BP members); I didn’t know they injected their shoulders muscles, wow this was a very nice video, telling us about something different than the usual diets and surgery.; you stole a video from a Russian speaker!!; It just a consumptions culture &amp; they dedicate their life onto that; I always wondered what&#39;s so stressful about being an idol😅 I mean you are doing what you love like singing and dancing but I guess these extra factors are the culprits 🤔; Bro at this point everyone looks the same in kpop industry; POV: you want to BE a kpop idol so you’re forced to fit into standards and compare yourself.; I have fair skin but I&#39;m allergic to sunscreen so I can&#39;t go out in the sun.

Schooling didnt effect me as much but with Kpop for the first few years i was fine, i then started comparing my face or my body to idols subtly, then not so subtly, until i was 19 (2021) when it turned into anirexia, im now 22 and i still struggle with all of these - anorexia, bullimia, body dysmorphia, etc. the reason i say this is you dont realize until its too late and you&#39;re already so deep in, im not saying kpop is the cause of my eating disorders as i know its not, though i will say seeing idols so thin and hearing so many diets absolutely contributed heavily; 😂I Loved all you, your all have a place in my Heart 😘; Lets get started <b>the ad started</b>; THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST EMBELLISHED AND UGLY; The only thing I hate about my self is my body hair but it was before I came in k pop; Never swaet <br><br>Hyunjin be like: 👁️👄👁️; Это видео brownie kpop?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=370"">6:10</a>. Yeah that can’t be wonyoung like; This is what many new K-pop fans don’t realize, I have been a K-pop fan since I was 14 and I was naive and thought that they already born like that but as we grow we realiza all the bllsht that K-pop industry does and do not feel bad anymore, right now wonyoung fans are really sick honestly, they created something called wonyoungnism where they basically need to look like her and follow her as an example… again so naive …; When I watch Chinese Dramas, I get so mesmerised by their beauty and especially their 90 degree shoulders. I wonder what exercises they do to create such beautiful shoulders. Then came to know about the Botox which is also used in there 🤦🏻‍♀️ I was shocked.; <b>meanwhile hyunjin swetings like he come out of the sea</b>; yeah stop with the stupid fan fiction and focus on reality...oh and nice video.; Thank you for such an Informative and Wonderful Video that broke the myths and showed the dark sides of the KPop Industry and it&#39;s Worst Beauty Standards...; The real beauty is within your soul. If your soul is beautiful. Your physical will be automatically beautiful. ❤; I though they would also burn the sweat glandes with laser? miradry or smth like that is called?; We don&#39;t need to compare ourselves to them. Their life is different and young kids shoukd understand that.😊; WOW 😳; Fiance is a cosmetic surgeon in my country and a lot of the training seminars they&#39;re sent to are in South Korea, or they have South Koreans rhinoplasty specialists and other cosmetic surgeons come to conventions here to train other doctors. Some of the example photos they use are publicly available images of idols in different lighting (professional, candid, selfies etc) to show how certain implants or suture and lifting techniques can really flatter the face of celebrities and look imperceptible in different lighting. Even those you think are natural have had tweaks, whether it may be through filler or non invasive treatments like ulthera, exilys, onda, cryolipo, etc. Surgery also isn&#39;t so hard to recover from, it&#39;s not impossible that they&#39;ll have work done in between comebacks because you&#39;re technically presentable after a week for things like a rhinoplasty or blepheroplasty, you just need to keep taking the medications prescribed after the operation like antibiotics or anti inflammatory drugs. It&#39;s so much less obvious than people point out. <br><br>Another thing is that those idols who people like saying are &quot;all natural, because a nose like (idol) cannot be achieved by just anyone&quot; was a misinterpretation of a quote by a korean surgeon asked to comment on some idol&#39;s noses. Not everyone can accommodate having a high bridge even with surgery because the limiting factor is the amount of skin surrounding the area- while you can add height, it&#39;s not as easy to just add skin. So the famous &quot;natural&quot; noses like Miyeon, Sana, etc, have already been tweaked in some way but they had the benefit of having a higher bridge prior to their debut and peak, so it would be easier to add height from that point on.; &quot;Their armpits are lighter and cleaner than our future&quot;<br>Bro just roasted our armpits in 100 different languages...; I’m not a k-pop fan this video played on auto. But dark armpits are my worst insecurity. BOTOX for arm pits! Damn these girls work hard !; amazing video; I love how solar is just exposing the industry this whole video 😂😂; I would never change myself. I am so happy that I don’t need surgery and that I never DID THAT. I may be depressed, but I will never be insecure enough to get them :3; What&#39;s funny is Kpop fans (especially Koreans ofc) know that their beauty standards are downright unrealistic, but still continue to follow it anyway 🤦‍♂; That’s sad all that because they love music and dance; Waow people have become plastic; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=389"">6:29</a> yuna doesn’t wear hip pads; I&#39;m an American, I would never compare myself to unrealistic beauty standards. Personally I can&#39;t stand pale skin. I&#39;m Italian so I like olive skin. I don&#39;t compare myself to anyone. Only I have to be happy with myself. I don&#39;t care what others think!!!; I really hope many will watch and benefit from this video.  💙🙏🏻🕊🌞; that aoa pics are edited lol; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=2"">0:02</a> GOODBYE CUMMUNITY ☠️; “And they never sweat” hyunjin:💧👁👄👁💧; Dont do anything like this to see others because you are living your life not there 😮😮😢 i know there are a large pressure of beauty in this society 😢 but believe your natural beauty guys 😊😊; What is the use of fake beauty that will kill you inside of your body😳😳😏😏😏 no matter how you are your natural beauty is good for you ❤️❤️🥰❤️; &quot;My facial hair isnt coming back after doing laser hair removal&quot; <b>pikachu meme</b> you dont say?; he thought he ate the armpit joke in the beginning 🤣; They are brainwashing us just like they whitewash their skins; Aespa’s entire concept is about looking like ai with very little focus on talent or personality; WOW 😲😳😳 Only now i understand their &#39;perfection&#39;...🤭🤨🤢; I love your voice it is so sexy; Bleaching hair has got to be the worst thing to do. Might as well go to a salon even if the agency’s system disallows it.; idk why people blame others e.g society or fans or media when they are really doing to themselves whether bc they are want to stand out or self conscious also making other feel pressured. idols greedness and competitivness set these beauty standards.; for skin whitning I don&#39;t think they should bleach it as a asian who also loves light skin I do skin whitening remedies that are actaully healthy for your skin and remove bad bacteria why can&#39;t they just do the same<br>They mainly just remove the tan but most kpop idols are born fair so yeah I was also born fair but if your black you&#39;ll may end up black or dark brown not white; okay more misinformation. Koreans have a mutation that means some of them literally don&#39;t sweat and that most of them have odourless sweat. The antipersprant roller is what everyone who suffers from excessive sweating use as it stops the sweat glands for a certain amount of time. Botox injections are also very common for this type of condition so its really not that bad to use.; Honestly, watching this video, I felt SICK. I could barely hold my tears. Just tell me why? Why are the kpop companies torturing idols like this? The idols are living humans being for crying out loud. How can somebody do this to them? How?! How could they….People who run kpop companies are heartless inhumane pigs.; It&#39;s so weird to think that once you dedicate your life to this thing, there are professionals who look at you from head to toe, and point out a 100 things that you have to change in yourself.. how insecure that can make you feel, and then on top of that when a few years pass by, you realise people never really saw you for who you really are, instead loved you for a confirmed standard you attained surgery after surgery. I was a kpop fan back in 2017-2019, and we didn&#39;t really have videos like this that time, so I had no one to tell me how toxic everything is.. I struggled a lot with my body image, eventhough I am naturally thin.. it was really one of the worst times for me in that case. I don&#39;t know what I trying to be. Now I&#39;m older and healthier, and not a kpop fan anymore.; Just like hwasa said : i love my body❤; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=372"">6:12</a> спасибо за русские субтитры; Also, glutathione injections actually don’t really whiten your skin. It’s more that they brighten it, maybe making you a shade or two more fair. But to truly whiten the skin, there are more damaging or high risk methods that people use.; Instead of using hip pads, it’s more common now just to get Sculptra injections (as seen in ITZY’s Yuna and the BP members); I didn’t know they injected their shoulders muscles, wow this was a very nice video, telling us about something different than the usual diets and surgery.; you stole a video from a Russian speaker!!; It just a consumptions culture &amp; they dedicate their life onto that; I always wondered what&#39;s so stressful about being an idol😅 I mean you are doing what you love like singing and dancing but I guess these extra factors are the culprits 🤔; Bro at this point everyone looks the same in kpop industry; POV: you want to BE a kpop idol so you’re forced to fit into standards and compare yourself.; I have fair skin but I&#39;m allergic to sunscreen so I can&#39;t go out in the sun. Even though I look younger than my age, I can get skin cancer easily.; Does anyone know who that is at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjTYf4mYhwE&amp;t=443"">7:23</a>?

Toxic Beauty Standards Are Back &amp; It&#39;s Gen Z&#39;s Fault...,Salem Tovar,2023-10-22T19:38:36Z,Toxic Beauty Standards Are Back & It's Gen Z's Fault... Subscribe: https://s71.co/3rZoTir | Make sure to enable ALL push ...,DpZfmec7Nkg,"🦆; We all should cut social media; Salem, you nailed it! Beauty standards can be so toxic, and I love how you challenge them. I recently started my own channel to explore why we’re so obsessed with these ideals and how we can break free. What do you think is the best way to redefine beauty for ourselves without falling into these traps? 💋x; What do we lose by saying everyone is beautiful, especially when ugliness is rooted in white supremacy? Skin tone, hair texture and length, facial features, body size and height, cis-normativity are all white supremacist which is exactly why beauty standards can, and do, change overtime. The notion of ugliness is socially constructed, so do we really know who&#39;s beautiful? Or do they just fit neatly into these acceptable categories? Folks proved the influencer&#39;s point by commenting on how she doesn&#39;t fit into socially acceptable categories of desirability...; I personally think that everyone is beautiful on the outside, I find beauty in everyone even if society sees flaws, on the inside it varies tho.; 🦆💗; i love your channel so much because you inspire me to be myself and not care about following the norms or trends and just focus on myself; Good grief... The world is literally heating up and the new generations are discussing beauty... in order to get money from the social media. We ARE doomed...; Gen Z has become toxic.  I had so much hope for them.; Genz really dismantled the progeess and inclusivity millenials made when it comes to toxic beauty standards its so toxic now i wish i was never born i feel like everyone is more attractive than me and it makes me hate myself so much i don&#39;t even go out in public anymore; 🦆 ❤; Im a muslim girl and i would like to give a piece of my mind regarding this topic through the point of view of islam , god says in surat al imran <br>((3:107) And those whose faces have turned bright, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and therein they shall abide.)<br>God speaks about those who follow god&#39;s rule that they will have this aura of light and it indicates natural beauty that radiates from the soul like inner beauty that reflects on  the faces of the ppl who follow god&#39;s provisions like: not commiting adultery, not speaking bad about others, giving money to those who are in need of it, not to be egoistical, not to mock or belittle others,..etc <br><br>One thing i noticed in the west is the obssession with bad boys and honestly i dont find them handsome or attractive because god certainly also doesnt find them handome or attractive beacuse the concept of this verse also applies to them , im rating them from god&#39;s perspective not from patriarchy&#39;s percpective in which the boy who sleeps with the most girls is the attractive one, in religion its the other way around its men who follow god and fortify themselves from vulgar acts are the handsome ones and god bless them with inner beauty that shows on their faces <br>Hope this helps ❤🥰; I’m in Gen z. I think I’ve found that once a generation starts to become mostly adults they hit rock bottom and becomes awful 😭 wth is this yall like every generation sucks once their adults; She’s literally telling the truth; I agree with not everyone is beautiful on the outside but they can be on the inside.; A lot of people are saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder i think that&#39;s true. Like my taste in guys might not be the same as most girls. Such as masculine is seemed more attractive. Like todo or tengen level. But i like the gojo, anzai, and okabe level bodies. Best example is Chuuya. <br>Now i hope i didn&#39;t say completely different in the name of &#39;beauty is different to people&#39;; 🦆; „Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself“ :); <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpZfmec7Nkg&amp;t=7"">0:07</a> this is true…; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; But really, not everyone is beautiful, at least on the outside. There is no way to tell me that being 100 kg is normal 😅; Saw a video about a bunch of teens asking if they were frog or deer pretty and they had hip dips (and then suddenly loved them when someone mentioned they were trending), saying that their lip arch was like a 0.8 inch too small or something and they couldn&#39;t pass that to their kids like. These are just 100% new ways to develop EDs. Body dysmorphia already exists but I honestly think we are seeing a new wave of new EDs that we have not seen en mass before.; 🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆; People are no longer insecure. They&#39;re scared.; Good point I was thinking about that with my mom yesterday and now I feel so confident ❤🦆; 🦆<br>I fucking hate society 🤠👍; In all honesty, just the fact that I have to show myself out there into a picture, not to mention without filters or some sort of item to enhance/better my looks, it&#39;s a thought that would make my stomach turn and would recreate this sense that the world is falling or I might die type of nervousness, that I mean it when people are putting themselves out there. It takes confidence and  bravery to stand up and raise your hand in the middle of the internet knowing you can be bashed any time for any reason. I mean it, people are brave for showing themselves out there. How else can a person encourage and applaud someone for showing their vulnerable self on the internet when everything looks so nice and polished 😭; 🦆; Sharing this video with my niece! ❤; What I despise the most is that people are genuinely so obsessed over what should be considered beautiful and what shouldn’t. Beauty is subjective and everyone has different tastes on what they find beautiful. Unfortunately, many gen-z mfs think there is only one kind of Beauty and that should be the only kind of beauty. Either way, there is much more to a human than their beauty and I’m disappointed that beauty is their only focus.; Nothing compared to the older generations.; 🦆; 🦆; Discussing toxic beauty standards with all kinds of toxic chemicals on her face 🤔; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆🦆🫶🏼🫶🏼; The problem with vs shows now is not inclusivity, it&#39;s minimalism. It&#39;s all corporate clean girl type looks, not the pomp and glamour of the early shows, which is what made it fun.; 🦆❤️; 🦆🦆🦆; your eyeliner loos flawless.; A) Gen Z got their behaviours from every person and generation before them. No matter how good Gen Z is going, with bad support, all it takes is one bad apple for things to fall apart.<br><br>B) Beauty standards are a scale. In every period of history one person was preferred over the other. In truth, every person of every size and colour can style themselves to be pretty in their own way. The problem is prioritising one beauty standard over the others. That&#39;s how I see it right now.; I love this video, it came recommended at the right time for me emotionally. Thank you Salem 🥹❤; We shouldn&#39;t be glorifying/glamorizing these beauty standards or eating disorders. The beauty is pain stick needs to go. This is the era of love and acceptance of ourselves in my book.; 🦆; Even those Victoria secret models have surgery lol; 🦆; I think its fine to say not everyone is “traditionally beautiful” but saying not everyone is beautiful is just plain incorrect. People find different things beautiful; 🦆 hey, im split in the middle, cause i do think that 1 specific bodytype and size to show off the fashion catwalks is convenient, but i dont really care if it is a 32 or a 44.; 🦆🦆; thid video is an eye opener.......; 🦆; Also-it did ruin all those brands lol.; &amp; that’s why I deleted TikTok &amp; Instagram 😃👍🏽; I think this need for perfection also plays into having no identity, hence trend hopping. Beauty is subjective, and that is my stance. Mainstream beauty standards have been manipulated by the handful of people that hold the power. Exclusivity is important because there needs to be a showcase of different types of beauty.; Thank god an add was put in the middle of the Victoria secret comments because I could not process that amount of bullshit all at once; EDS girlies unite&lt;3; 🦆; As a member of Gen Z, I completely agree with everything that was said in this video. I think the problem with our generation is that we tend to have a lot of double edge &#39;activism&#39;. we always seem to be rooting for equality and inclusivity, but then as soon as it doesn&#39;t apply, be immediately backtrack. I also believe that it depends on how you are raised to see the world through a different perspective.; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; I&#39;m a millennial but that&#39;s probably not very relevant. Anyway I think a lot about beauty standards--I used to be a model/dancer &amp; my mother is a hairstylist. I completely agree with you when you say &quot;we&#39;re not supposed to be exposed to so much hotness.&quot; The level of focus on appearance, especially for femme presenting people, is absolutely wild. If anyone is interested, there are 2 books that I recommend: &quot;Beauty Sick&quot; and &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;. I studied psychology in college &amp; did some women&#39;s studies classes, which are fascinating.; Victoria&#39;s Secret is an eating disorder 😣; Instead of toxic beauty standards, I&#39;ve been learning to cook 😊; Preach it girl! 🤩; Someone who says “ everybody is beautiful on the inside, but not everyone is/can be beautiful on the outside”… sweet cute girly, let me tell you this: someone who’s beautiful on the inside will never feel the need to bring other people down by going on a platform to tell a bunch of people they don’t even know, that they are NOT beautiful 😂; Does Fannita think she herself is beautiful?; Does Fannita think she herself is beautiful?; 🦆<br>I love the last 5 minutes. You are very right about Gen Alpha as well. I have noticed them skip from kids to &quot;mini models.&quot;; Thank you; Nowadays is not even about looking pretty. But looking “ethereal” “angelic” “otherworldly”. Like being pretty is not even enough anymore, nor you gotta look like a literal supernatural being. The amount of beautiful girls I’ve seen being called “mid” or like “pretty but plain” or “earthy looking” whatever that means, is insane to me. Beauty standards are morphing into something surreal and scary (the concept); 🦆; I love how the first girl says something so inhumane and disgusting, and then tries to defend herself and say She &quot;isnt&quot; a mean girl.  What a hurt woman, I hope she heals and stops bashing on the other girls who are supportive; Girl, you&#39;re so right.; personally, i think that not everyones going to be beautiful to YOU, just like how you&#39;re not beautiful to everyone. however, everyone should be allowed to have their opinions (as long as they keep them to theirselves). we also shouldn&#39;t let beauty affect how we treat people, which may be the harder part of this all, but if we all learn to just be less judgemental, (because a the end of the day were all just piles of flesh w genetically predetermined faces w a ton of thoughts feelings nd prefferences we might instill on others by mistake), then everything should b fine. being able to love yourself and be ur beautiful self wo putting other skills is smth we as gen z really needa start doing b4 all of these dtandars rip us apart<br><br>another amazing video salem &lt;3; People will protect their own self-hatred. That&#39;s the reason so many are against inclusiveness, it exposes how one truly feels about themselves.; 🦆🦆🦆🦆; 🦆 great video!; 🦆; 🦆; i think of myself as 8/10 so ig im a 9; 🦆 I agree with this. Body neutrality  😊; Body neutrality is the only way; 🦆; 🦆; Why are you styled like My Generation &amp; Demography &amp; How We Grew Up      ?; The problem is that beauty is no longer as subjective as it used to be. How pleasant you are to a person is already determined by public approval transmitted through social networks. Because of this suggestion, many guys and girls who are not &quot;pretty enough for social media&quot; are no longer considered attractive to a potential partner, employer, or peer group. Now the standards are too high, and many people think that this is the norm. And a normal, natural appearance already requires some kind of self-care in order to achieve the image that people show us on social networks.; 🦆 &lt;3; 🦆 best video yet!!; I think too, not just comparing and adding standards and feeling this need to be perfect by seeing perfection all the time … social media has also affected beauty standards because everyone and their mother feels they need to say something. I know opinions are like buttholes and everyone has them … but you shouldn’t go around showing them to everyone.; 🦆🦆🦆; 🦆the end message…take us to church salem !!; You are literally my new comfort YouTuber ❤; U have good points but i disagree. I dont look like vs angel abd i really dont mind bc its somthing that not many people will archive. Making everything ”woke” also takes the glamour away from it. Beauty sells and thats just truth; Don&#39;t normalise fatness..jeez; Of course NOT everyone is beautiful and the woman in the interview at the beginning is absolutely right! What&#39;s wrong with saying that out loud? Beauty is NOT the ultimate goal to achieve! Better work on getting that out of your head! All the social media stuff in recent years has turned people into superficial, egotistical self-promoters for whom appearance is more than reality. Stop lying and pretending that you are always just nice and polite and politically correct! This is just a show so that others like you and you get more followers! I&#39;d rather be real, honest, intelligent and be able to form an opinion on my own than just beautiful!","Toxic Beauty Standards Are Back &amp; It&#39;s Gen Z&#39;s Fault...

I had so much hope for them.; Genz really dismantled the progeess and inclusivity millenials made when it comes to toxic beauty standards its so toxic now i wish i was never born i feel like everyone is more attractive than me and it makes me hate myself so much i don&#39;t even go out in public anymore; 🦆 ❤; Im a muslim girl and i would like to give a piece of my mind regarding this topic through the point of view of islam , god says in surat al imran <br>((3:107) And those whose faces have turned bright, they will be in the mercy of Allah, and therein they shall abide.)<br>God speaks about those who follow god&#39;s rule that they will have this aura of light and it indicates natural beauty that radiates from the soul like inner beauty that reflects on  the faces of the ppl who follow god&#39;s provisions like: not commiting adultery, not speaking bad about others, giving money to those who are in need of it, not to be egoistical, not to mock or belittle others,..etc <br><br>One thing i noticed in the west is the obssession with bad boys and honestly i dont find them handsome or attractive because god certainly also doesnt find them handome or attractive beacuse the concept of this verse also applies to them , im rating them from god&#39;s perspective not from patriarchy&#39;s percpective in which the boy who sleeps with the most girls is the attractive one, in religion its the other way around its men who follow god and fortify themselves from vulgar acts are the handsome ones and god bless them with inner beauty that shows on their faces <br>Hope this helps ❤🥰; I’m in Gen z. I think I’ve found that once a generation starts to become mostly adults they hit rock bottom and becomes awful 😭 wth is this yall like every generation sucks once their adults; She’s literally telling the truth; I agree with not everyone is beautiful on the outside but they can be on the inside.; A lot of people are saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder i think that&#39;s true. Like my taste in guys might not be the same as most girls. Such as masculine is seemed more attractive. Like todo or tengen level. But i like the gojo, anzai, and okabe level bodies. Best example is Chuuya. <br>Now i hope i didn&#39;t say completely different in the name of &#39;beauty is different to people&#39;; 🦆; „Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself“ :); <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpZfmec7Nkg&amp;t=7"">0:07</a> this is true…; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; But really, not everyone is beautiful, at least on the outside. There is no way to tell me that being 100 kg is normal 😅; Saw a video about a bunch of teens asking if they were frog or deer pretty and they had hip dips (and then suddenly loved them when someone mentioned they were trending), saying that their lip arch was like a 0.8 inch too small or something and they couldn&#39;t pass that to their kids like. These are just 100% new ways to develop EDs. Body dysmorphia already exists but I honestly think we are seeing a new wave of new EDs that we have not seen en mass before.; 🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆; People are no longer insecure. They&#39;re scared.; Good point I was thinking about that with my mom yesterday and now I feel so confident ❤🦆; 🦆<br>I fucking hate society 🤠👍; In all honesty, just the fact that I have to show myself out there into a picture, not to mention without filters or some sort of item to enhance/better my looks, it&#39;s a thought that would make my stomach turn and would recreate this sense that the world is falling or I might die type of nervousness, that I mean it when people are putting themselves out there. It takes confidence and  bravery to stand up and raise your hand in the middle of the internet knowing you can be bashed any time for any reason. I mean it, people are brave for showing themselves out there. How else can a person encourage and applaud someone for showing their vulnerable self on the internet when everything looks so nice and polished 😭; 🦆; Sharing this video with my niece! ❤; What I despise the most is that people are genuinely so obsessed over what should be considered beautiful and what shouldn’t. Beauty is subjective and everyone has different tastes on what they find beautiful. Unfortunately, many gen-z mfs think there is only one kind of Beauty and that should be the only kind of beauty. Either way, there is much more to a human than their beauty and I’m disappointed that beauty is their only focus.; Nothing compared to the older generations.; 🦆; 🦆; Discussing toxic beauty standards with all kinds of toxic chemicals on her face 🤔; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆🦆🫶🏼🫶🏼; The problem with vs shows now is not inclusivity, it&#39;s minimalism. It&#39;s all corporate clean girl type looks, not the pomp and glamour of the early shows, which is what made it fun.; 🦆❤️; 🦆🦆🦆; your eyeliner loos flawless.; A) Gen Z got their behaviours from every person and generation before them. No matter how good Gen Z is going, with bad support, all it takes is one bad apple for things to fall apart.<br><br>B) Beauty standards are a scale. In every period of history one person was preferred over the other. In truth, every person of every size and colour can style themselves to be pretty in their own way. The problem is prioritising one beauty standard over the others. That&#39;s how I see it right now.; I love this video, it came recommended at the right time for me emotionally. Thank you Salem 🥹❤; We shouldn&#39;t be glorifying/glamorizing these beauty standards or eating disorders. The beauty is pain stick needs to go. This is the era of love and acceptance of ourselves in my book.; 🦆; Even those Victoria secret models have surgery lol; 🦆; I think its fine to say not everyone is “traditionally beautiful” but saying not everyone is beautiful is just plain incorrect. People find different things beautiful; 🦆 hey, im split in the middle, cause i do think that 1 specific bodytype and size to show off the fashion catwalks is convenient, but i dont really care if it is a 32 or a 44.; 🦆🦆; thid video is an eye opener.......; 🦆; Also-it did ruin all those brands lol.; &amp; that’s why I deleted TikTok &amp; Instagram 😃👍🏽; I think this need for perfection also plays into having no identity, hence trend hopping. Beauty is subjective, and that is my stance. Mainstream beauty standards have been manipulated by the handful of people that hold the power. Exclusivity is important because there needs to be a showcase of different types of beauty.; Thank god an add was put in the middle of the Victoria secret comments because I could not process that amount of bullshit all at once; EDS girlies unite&lt;3; 🦆; As a member of Gen Z, I completely agree with everything that was said in this video. I think the problem with our generation is that we tend to have a lot of double edge &#39;activism&#39;. we always seem to be rooting for equality and inclusivity, but then as soon as it doesn&#39;t apply, be immediately backtrack. I also believe that it depends on how you are raised to see the world through a different perspective.; 🦆; 🦆; 🦆; I&#39;m a millennial but that&#39;s probably not very relevant. Anyway I think a lot about beauty standards--I used to be a model/dancer &amp; my mother is a hairstylist. I completely agree with you when you say &quot;we&#39;re not supposed to be exposed to so much hotness.&quot; The level of focus on appearance, especially for femme presenting people, is absolutely wild. If anyone is interested, there are 2 books that I recommend: &quot;Beauty Sick&quot; and &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;. I studied psychology in college &amp; did some women&#39;s studies classes, which are fascinating.; Victoria&#39;s Secret is an eating disorder 😣; Instead of toxic beauty standards, I&#39;ve been learning to cook 😊; Preach it girl! 🤩; Someone who says “ everybody is beautiful on the inside, but not everyone is/can be beautiful on the outside”… sweet cute girly, let me tell you this: someone who’s beautiful on the inside will never feel the need to bring other people down by going on a platform to tell a bunch of people they don’t even know, that they are NOT beautiful 😂; Does Fannita think she herself is beautiful?; Does Fannita think she herself is beautiful?; 🦆<br>I love the last 5 minutes. You are very right about Gen Alpha as well. I have noticed them skip from kids to &quot;mini models.&quot;; Thank you; Nowadays is not even about looking pretty. But looking “ethereal” “angelic” “otherworldly”. Like being pretty is not even enough anymore, nor you gotta look like a literal supernatural being. The amount of beautiful girls I’ve seen being called “mid” or like “pretty but plain” or “earthy looking” whatever that means, is insane to me. Beauty standards are morphing into something surreal and scary (the concept); 🦆; I love how the first girl says something so inhumane and disgusting, and then tries to defend herself and say She &quot;isnt&quot; a mean girl.  What a hurt woman, I hope she heals and stops bashing on the other girls who are supportive; Girl, you&#39;re so right.; personally, i think that not everyones going to be beautiful to YOU, just like how you&#39;re not beautiful to everyone. however, everyone should be allowed to have their opinions (as long as they keep them to theirselves). we also shouldn&#39;t let beauty affect how we treat people, which may be the harder part of this all, but if we all learn to just be less judgemental, (because a the end of the day were all just piles of flesh w genetically predetermined faces w a ton of thoughts feelings nd prefferences we might instill on others by mistake), then everything should b fine. being able to love yourself and be ur beautiful self wo putting other skills is smth we as gen z really needa start doing b4 all of these dtandars rip us apart<br><br>another amazing video salem &lt;3; People will protect their own self-hatred. That&#39;s the reason so many are against inclusiveness, it exposes how one truly feels about themselves.; 🦆🦆🦆🦆; 🦆 great video!; 🦆; 🦆; i think of myself as 8/10 so ig im a 9; 🦆 I agree with this. Body neutrality  😊; Body neutrality is the only way; 🦆; 🦆; Why are you styled like My Generation &amp; Demography &amp; How We Grew Up      ?; The problem is that beauty is no longer as subjective as it used to be. How pleasant you are to a person is already determined by public approval transmitted through social networks. Because of this suggestion, many guys and girls who are not &quot;pretty enough for social media&quot; are no longer considered attractive to a potential partner, employer, or peer group. Now the standards are too high, and many people think that this is the norm. And a normal, natural appearance already requires some kind of self-care in order to achieve the image that people show us on social networks.; 🦆 &lt;3; 🦆 best video yet!!; I think too, not just comparing and adding standards and feeling this need to be perfect by seeing perfection all the time … social media has also affected beauty standards because everyone and their mother feels they need to say something. I know opinions are like buttholes and everyone has them … but you shouldn’t go around showing them to everyone.; 🦆🦆🦆; 🦆the end message…take us to church salem !!; You are literally my new comfort YouTuber ❤; U have good points but i disagree. I dont look like vs angel abd i really dont mind bc its somthing that not many people will archive. Making everything ”woke” also takes the glamour away from it. Beauty sells and thats just truth; Don&#39;t normalise fatness..jeez; Of course NOT everyone is beautiful and the woman in the interview at the beginning is absolutely right! What&#39;s wrong with saying that out loud? Beauty is NOT the ultimate goal to achieve! Better work on getting that out of your head! All the social media stuff in recent years has turned people into superficial, egotistical self-promoters for whom appearance is more than reality. Stop lying and pretending that you are always just nice and polite and politically correct! This is just a show so that others like you and you get more followers! I&#39;d rather be real, honest, intelligent and be able to form an opinion on my own than just beautiful!",toxic beauty standard back 39 gen z 39 fault toxic beauty standard back gen z fault subscribe

Plastic Surgery vs Natural Beauty | Middle Ground,Jubilee,2024-08-25T16:00:45Z,Hey you Wanna be in a Jubilee video? https://bit.ly/be-in-a-video LET'S BE FRIENDS Instagram: ...,pNTr-ArBnSo,"Want to join the conversation? Submit a prompt for the BIGGEST Middle Ground episode yet. We’ll choose our favorite with the help of @thefireorg, and your name will appear in the episode! Comment your best prompt on this post: (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-vtmadyOmV)"">https://www.instagram.com/p/C-vtmadyOmV)</a>; “Some people tryna look like elves” 😂; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTr-ArBnSo&amp;t=722"">12:02</a> I can answer that, natural people don&#39;t care if someone gets plastic surgery or not we care about the principle of genuineness. How can you genuinely love yourself or be joyful if you are constantly picking yourself a part? Joyful people find the beauty in themselves regardless of what they look like. People who get plastic surgery think they will find joy after mutilating themselves however, they only find more &#39;issues&#39; with themselves and instead of self-reflecting they pay someone thousands to &#39;fix&#39; them. cosmetic plastic surgery is like a drug to deeply insecure people which is being administered by doctors who exploit those insecurities.; Gizelle needs to lay off the plastic surgeries...yikes. the Dr just agreeing to keep her business incoming; Plastic surgery makes no sense.<br><br>The whole concept is to look more attractive.  So if it works, you’re attracting someone who likes you for something that was never and will never be you.  So you end up never being yourself and I think never capable of honest and deep love.; lmaooo @ the plastic surgeon lady - we CAN tell🤣; That girl said 26 but she looks much older. When you’re younger with lots of plastic surgery, it has the opposite effect.; It starts in the home. Install security, confidence, and self worth into your children so they don’t turn to industry to tell them what is and isn’t beautiful. <br><br>I think it is one thing for someone to have something they want to improve, but when you start looking like the 2 girls on this show, you probably need to consult a therapist. You just flat out don’t like yourself. Nothing you do will ever satisfy your quest to perfection.; the girl with the labia watching this 🥲; The surgeon’s first input to this discussion where she talked about ageing and how we can and should do things to help us age better… why? Can we just live in peace, fml. Ageing is normal and an underrated blessing.; The surgeon is way too extreme??? Im not the only one noticing this for sure, also this is a person who&#39;s the topic is their practice of course they&#39;ll defend but quick question I thought cosmetic surgeon and surgeons that operates to fix an abnormality or something that could  dangerous/inconvenient are different from one another; amala is skinny, her boobs are up, her skin is clear her face is symmetrical she’s the look people are fighting for of course she’s pro natural.; the people who are anti surgery are a also hot and societally acceptably beautiful. it kinda makes what they say feel less impactful. show me people with flaws who don’t wanna fix it.; As a woman there is nothing wrong with having asymmetric labia it&#39;s totally normal.; Insecure vs Confident women; There&#39;s that one white dude that&#39;s trying to look like BTS member who&#39;s Korean.; More accessible but not everyone&#39;s going to do it.....example...Penial enlargement is available but not everyone does it.  No matter how cheap and easy and safe it becomes there will always be people who&#39;ll just say &quot;nah&quot;.; If professional teach youngsters how to spot plastic surgery, would that help youngsters realize unrealistic beauty standards....or will that help youngsters realize that they also can pay to achieve unrealistic beauty standards?; Amala is such a wonderful person!; Honestly these woman need to gtfo out of California. NOT EVERY WOMAN IS WALKING AROUND WITH A BBL YOU ARE DEFINITELY INSECURE IF YOU FEEL A TYPE OF WAY JUST CASUE ANOTHER WOMAN HAS A BBL GET A GRIP 💀; Christie looks a lot like Connie perrigion and Tokyo leigh; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTr-ArBnSo&amp;t=1925"">32:05</a> it’s so normalized that people are now getting special treatment for not doing all of these body argumentations lol a whole new breed of narcissist using that for attention and admiration; Natural all day everyday I prefer a woman who doesn’t even wear makeup.; Plastic surgery always looks atrocious. Theee women are just ruining themselves.; Surgery compared to makeup is crazy. Makeup you can correct and always go back to yourself, surgery; you can’t go back…; Absence of hip dip is not a clear sign of bbl. My little sister and plenty other black women don’t have hip dips . I miss the days of being able to marvel at someone’s genetics without having to question; I wish they were talking about medical necessity vs selective surgeries. That’s what it is. The doctor tried to say examples of medical necessity but selective is more like cosmetic procedure that’s optional; Amala is aesthetically pleasing. She is well styled and gorgeous hair.; There&#39;s actually no real difference between the labiaplasty that surgeon performed on the girl and FGM (female genital mutilation). We love to criticize other countries for that practice even though we do the same thing here.; Lmao that plastic surgeon saying she has so so much filler but you could never tell… girl.. look at your unnatural forehead.; The group hug at the end was a win; Christie is stunning. I loved hearing her points too, she’s so intelligent and empathetic 🥺; I found it sad how the Dr. was saying you’d never know she has 16 syringes of Botox yet counter acted that by saying my forehead hasn’t moved for yrs like mam? If it doesn’t show expressions then ppl most certainly know? Also that again perpetuates the fact that ppl lie about having work done just because you can’t tell; I’m a board certified Dermatologist - you don’t need filler in your 20s or Botox.  I disagree with the plastic surgeon. Also different skin tones age  differently . It’s also very obvious Dr. Nazarian had work done. She looks great, but she does not look natural at all.; I think it’s up to the person. However, I think at some point if these people are coming in over and over again and completely changing their body it’s the surgeons job to put a stop to it. Meaning at some point they really ought to turn the patients away.; Ngl Nikki is actually beautiful; my mom gave me the option to get a chin reduction surgery cause i was bullied. i think i just wanted to have her support and the option more than i wanted to have the actual surgery. i chose not to because she told me that she thought i was beautiful how i was.; fraudmaxxing to pass inferior genes so that your kids will suffer as well; As someone who has had plastic surgery done to me extreme circumstances. I agree that plastic surgery should not be normalized, but it also shouldn’t be demonized. It should be an option for people who need it; What&#39;s up with the wide frame being so out of focus, and the video generally being unclear and too dark?; me to all girls regardless what they did and what they thru  : 🫂 🫂🫂; Daphne is out of touch and a solid example of the current culture.; Please ask men some of these questions.; Surgeons playing devils advocate; I love so soft spoken all of these women are; If you&#39;re getting surgery, get you&#39;re mind done first. tragic insecurities😆.; Wish they had some older women included.; Reconstructive =/= cosmetic<br><br>That surgeon didn&#39;t give a single example that involved cosmetic surgery.; so they got the lady with the most extreme nose? thats body dissmorphia; Amala is so elegant and so so smart, would love to see more of her in other debates 🤍; what concerns me the most is that the channel in itself had a list of people thta needed to fit very detailed characteristics in order to be part of the video and be categorized as 1 or 2 , its saddening to see reality the way it is; The problem is a lot of women lack accountability. As soon as the lady that started surgery said who&#39;s to blame for her surgery is a different question, i knew a lot of them will never say they are the problem instead they&#39;ll rather blame society or everyone else.; Are naturally beautiful ppl even allowed to have an opinion on this? Theyre all beautiful. Why would they want surgery; Cosmetic Surgery to fix <b>abnormalities</b> ? Sure.... cosmetic surgery as a permanent solution instead of makeup? Absolutely not. <br><br>Surgery is meant to fix things that aren&#39;t normal and affect your quality of life. The solution to a person who doesn&#39;t like the shape of their nose is not to pay a doctor to break it reshape it for you. If you have a deviated septum and can&#39;t breathe properly then sure...but not because you want a nose like Sabrina Carpenter.; The plastic surgeon should not have been in the group.; As a husband, natural beauty is my wife waking up in the am with messy hair, no makeup, in a shirt with holes near the collar. This is when shes most beautiful❤; the plastic surgeon is using the most extreme medical cases shes ever seen as an argument for the normalization and push for surgical alterations. shes so on board with all this because it brings her money. she sees it as a benefit to push this because it benefits her in return, whereas the other girls there are on different conversations that are actually realistic and not just talking about the most extreme cases but also the very common ones that make the majority of cosmetic surgery cases.; If your surgeon looks like an alien 👽 you are about to look like one too” ummm lady you do look like an alien 👽 😂😂😂 and you could tell you have Botox 💁🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️; For scientific research, does the curvy Asian girl have an onlyfans?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTr-ArBnSo&amp;t=1998"">33:18</a> The voluptuous stereo type i argue did not derive from black culture. Black People were enslaved, didnt care or bring up the shape of their bodies. Whites portrayed blacks in media as big nosed big lipped big hipped. Once blacks gained more freedom black appreciation culture developed. Not only were they beginning to value their features that were previously oppressed they started to value all parts of their culture. Yes black culture can get it of hand and be super prideful but to say that blacks caused the beauty standard to be this way is crazy. Appreciation of what was previously unappreciated did not cause y’all to not like your bodies. And for you to say Chinese bodies are “made like this” which is why you wanted to change yours is crazy. Imagine your daughter hearing that… and don’t blame black people for the comparison YOU made 😢; The amount of money the plastic surgeon probably spends on “box’s of filler” to “restore” her face must be crazyyyy if she crashed out like that and felt comfortable telling that story like it wasn’t insanely sad. The filler upkeep must be hard work.; Daphnes inspiration photo for her facial work must’ve been that Woah Vicky chic. Hopefully her future daughters work doesn’t make her look like an aged woah Vicky as well (let’s be honest her daughters getting work done having Daphne as a mom if she still thinks like this as a mother one day…).; The women here self-proclaiming they’re victims of the plastic surgery industry are only victims of themselves. Where’s the accountability?<br><br>PS: I’m not against plastic surgery. It’s a personal choice. And I just dislike self-proclaims victims who lack accountability.; Needed a older natural black women in this , too much sugar coating stil😂; How bout when their kids don’t come out looking like them😅😂; It’s a bunch of sugarcoating fr, who gon let they 16yrold daughter get a nose job; I love this debate it’s such a mature and respectful environment; The naturally beautiful hippy woman is actually beautiful. But she can only speak because she has been so blessed 🎉 FOR THE REST OF YALL MFs better get it together 😂 It&#39;s not gonna get any better because women have children with some questionable men because they have money.

I’m sure all women feel insecure from time to time, but if you’re considered “conventionally attractive” you don’t truly understand how horrible society can make you feel, everyday, when you naturally don’t meet the beauty standard.; i would never change how the way i look just to please others because i love how the way i look i love embrace how i look the organic way i want to stay true to myself by being myself do what makes me happy i would not want to be someone that i&#39;m not be and look certain way just to please others make them happy because it won&#39;t make me happy at all that&#39;s just me but i respect everyone&#39;s free will i also wanna say that some will think some of us look attractive and some will think we look unattractive having our own difference preference i respect that as long we don&#39;t force most that don&#39;t wanna change how the way they look because i think it&#39;s not ok if some force most to change there appearance for most that don&#39;t want to change there appearance just to make someone else happy just to please others being someone they are not but if somee that do want to change there appearance with platic surgery they are doing it for themselves nobody else than that&#39;s fine as long they are doing it because some of them wanna do it but if they are doing it for someone else being someone they are not than that&#39;s when i think that&#39;s not ok that&#39;s when i think it&#39;s a problem not natural to me i think it&#39;s ok if some choose to get platic surgery and some choose to not get no platic sugery to love embrace how the way they look the organic way sure apart of me do agree most say nobody is perfect but at the sametime there is also apart of me i think everyone is perfect just the way they are i want to share my honest difference perspective perception; Amala Ekpunobi is <b>FINE!!!</b>; In the next episode can we have all of them look into a mirror while on LSD/magic mushrooms lol 🍄 ✨; I think the society already makes u feel insecure that&#39;s why your husband can spend 2 years not sleeping with you after birthing his children; The Surgeon came to protect her business; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTr-ArBnSo&amp;t=165"">2:45</a> why do children have to wear swimsuits this tight and revealing?? I’ve always hated this; This is a very respectful discussion. I think all these ladies, even the surgeon, listened and considered everyone else&#39;s perspectives.; The first sample that the surgeon mention was acceptable because it actually something that is not normal and it hinders her daughter&#39;s daily life. I&#39;m not against any cosmetic surgery because if you&#39;re happy about it go...  But don&#39;t tell people that they have ugly whatever on their face or body as they just don&#39;t want to touch something that is &quot;natural&quot; and so long as they are contented to their look.; In my opinion as a young teenager I too have been feeling insecure as well despite my mother telling me, &quot;You look beautiful&quot; Or, &quot; Be confident in the skin you&#39;re in.&quot; I just felt like it wasn&#39;t enough, however I wasn&#39;t comparing myself to other girls. I just knew in my heart that I wanted to be skinny, I hated the way my nose looked big on my face, I hated the way my eyes look and because of this I get self conscious in social areas.<br><br>I have honestly been considering nose surgery to make it smaller, but then I stopped when I realized how the surgery could come out badly as well. Then I started to love myself after months.<br><br>I truly believe if girls learn to love themselves and feel confident in themselves that they won&#39;t care about following trends or what others are doing to their bodies, because being yourself is being unique within itself and in times where surgeries are becoming common because of media influence you&#39;d actually stand out more being yourself than you would going under the blade. <br><br>Insecurities come from your heart, from the inside. No matter who gives you support, you&#39;d still follow what YOUR mind wants, but at the end of the day you still won&#39;t be satisfied with your changes and it&#39;s a toxic cycle that needs to be stopped somewhere. How can it be stopped? By solving the deeper issue which is loving yourself. I know it&#39;s a hard process, but it&#39;s not impossible.; No surgery, no makeup.. No superficial mental midgets.; Also it’s not from African American it’s from African , the original culture that these curvy bodies come from!; Not all bodies without hip dips mean BBL.

That a woman who gave life has &quot;weird&quot; breasts because they don&#39;t fit into a p*rn standard?

Give me a break girl, most of us will age and can&#39;t afford surgery, so that&#39;s also normal.; the black chick can have my kids 😍😍; Waiting for the strawberry park reaction, lol.; that doctor is so harmful; It’s so weird how for the natural women, they selected such a beautiful group of women that are very much fit the beauty standard.

How can you genuinely love yourself or be joyful if you are constantly picking yourself a part? Joyful people find the beauty in themselves regardless of what they look like. People who get plastic surgery think they will find joy after mutilating themselves however, they only find more &#39;issues&#39; with themselves and instead of self-reflecting they pay someone thousands to &#39;fix&#39; them. cosmetic plastic surgery is like a drug to deeply insecure people which is being administered by doctors who exploit those insecurities.; Gizelle needs to lay off the plastic surgeries...yikes. the Dr just agreeing to keep her business incoming; Plastic surgery makes no sense.<br><br>The whole concept is to look more attractive.  So if it works, you’re attracting someone who likes you for something that was never and will never be you.  So you end up never being yourself and I think never capable of honest and deep love.; lmaooo @ the plastic surgeon lady - we CAN tell🤣; That girl said 26 but she looks much older. When you’re younger with lots of plastic surgery, it has the opposite effect.; It starts in the home. Install security, confidence, and self worth into your children so they don’t turn to industry to tell them what is and isn’t beautiful. <br><br>I think it is one thing for someone to have something they want to improve, but when you start looking like the 2 girls on this show, you probably need to consult a therapist. You just flat out don’t like yourself. Nothing you do will ever satisfy your quest to perfection.; the girl with the labia watching this 🥲; The surgeon’s first input to this discussion where she talked about ageing and how we can and should do things to help us age better… why? Can we just live in peace, fml. Ageing is normal and an underrated blessing.; The surgeon is way too extreme??? Im not the only one noticing this for sure, also this is a person who&#39;s the topic is their practice of course they&#39;ll defend but quick question I thought cosmetic surgeon and surgeons that operates to fix an abnormality or something that could  dangerous/inconvenient are different from one another; amala is skinny, her boobs are up, her skin is clear her face is symmetrical she’s the look people are fighting for of course she’s pro natural.; the people who are anti surgery are a also hot and societally acceptably beautiful. it kinda makes what they say feel less impactful. show me people with flaws who don’t wanna fix it.; As a woman there is nothing wrong with having asymmetric labia it&#39;s totally normal.; Insecure vs Confident women; There&#39;s that one white dude that&#39;s trying to look like BTS member who&#39;s Korean.; More accessible but not everyone&#39;s going to do it.....example...Penial enlargement is available but not everyone does it.

Theee women are just ruining themselves.; Surgery compared to makeup is crazy. Makeup you can correct and always go back to yourself, surgery; you can’t go back…; Absence of hip dip is not a clear sign of bbl. My little sister and plenty other black women don’t have hip dips . I miss the days of being able to marvel at someone’s genetics without having to question; I wish they were talking about medical necessity vs selective surgeries. That’s what it is. The doctor tried to say examples of medical necessity but selective is more like cosmetic procedure that’s optional; Amala is aesthetically pleasing. She is well styled and gorgeous hair.; There&#39;s actually no real difference between the labiaplasty that surgeon performed on the girl and FGM (female genital mutilation). We love to criticize other countries for that practice even though we do the same thing here.; Lmao that plastic surgeon saying she has so so much filler but you could never tell… girl.. look at your unnatural forehead.; The group hug at the end was a win; Christie is stunning. I loved hearing her points too, she’s so intelligent and empathetic 🥺; I found it sad how the Dr. was saying you’d never know she has 16 syringes of Botox yet counter acted that by saying my forehead hasn’t moved for yrs like mam? If it doesn’t show expressions then ppl most certainly know? Also that again perpetuates the fact that ppl lie about having work done just because you can’t tell; I’m a board certified Dermatologist - you don’t need filler in your 20s or Botox.  I disagree with the plastic surgeon. Also different skin tones age  differently . It’s also very obvious Dr. Nazarian had work done. She looks great, but she does not look natural at all.; I think it’s up to the person. However, I think at some point if these people are coming in over and over again and completely changing their body it’s the surgeons job to put a stop to it. Meaning at some point they really ought to turn the patients away.; Ngl Nikki is actually beautiful; my mom gave me the option to get a chin reduction surgery cause i was bullied. i think i just wanted to have her support and the option more than i wanted to have the actual surgery. i chose not to because she told me that she thought i was beautiful how i was.; fraudmaxxing to pass inferior genes so that your kids will suffer as well; As someone who has had plastic surgery done to me extreme circumstances. I agree that plastic surgery should not be normalized, but it also shouldn’t be demonized. It should be an option for people who need it; What&#39;s up with the wide frame being so out of focus, and the video generally being unclear and too dark?; me to all girls regardless what they did and what they thru  : 🫂 🫂🫂; Daphne is out of touch and a solid example of the current culture.; Please ask men some of these questions.; Surgeons playing devils advocate; I love so soft spoken all of these women are; If you&#39;re getting surgery, get you&#39;re mind done first. tragic insecurities😆.; Wish they had some older women included.; Reconstructive =/= cosmetic<br><br>That surgeon didn&#39;t give a single example that involved cosmetic surgery.; so they got the lady with the most extreme nose? thats body dissmorphia; Amala is so elegant and so so smart, would love to see more of her in other debates 🤍; what concerns me the most is that the channel in itself had a list of people thta needed to fit very detailed characteristics in order to be part of the video and be categorized as 1 or 2 , its saddening to see reality the way it is; The problem is a lot of women lack accountability. As soon as the lady that started surgery said who&#39;s to blame for her surgery is a different question, i knew a lot of them will never say they are the problem instead they&#39;ll rather blame society or everyone else.; Are naturally beautiful ppl even allowed to have an opinion on this? Theyre all beautiful. Why would they want surgery; Cosmetic Surgery to fix <b>abnormalities</b> ? Sure.... cosmetic surgery as a permanent solution instead of makeup? Absolutely not. <br><br>Surgery is meant to fix things that aren&#39;t normal and affect your quality of life. The solution to a person who doesn&#39;t like the shape of their nose is not to pay a doctor to break it reshape it for you. If you have a deviated septum and can&#39;t breathe properly then sure...but not because you want a nose like Sabrina Carpenter.; The plastic surgeon should not have been in the group.; As a husband, natural beauty is my wife waking up in the am with messy hair, no makeup, in a shirt with holes near the collar. This is when shes most beautiful❤; the plastic surgeon is using the most extreme medical cases shes ever seen as an argument for the normalization and push for surgical alterations. shes so on board with all this because it brings her money. she sees it as a benefit to push this because it benefits her in return, whereas the other girls there are on different conversations that are actually realistic and not just talking about the most extreme cases but also the very common ones that make the majority of cosmetic surgery cases.; If your surgeon looks like an alien 👽 you are about to look like one too” ummm lady you do look like an alien 👽 😂😂😂 and you could tell you have Botox 💁🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️; For scientific research, does the curvy Asian girl have an onlyfans?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTr-ArBnSo&amp;t=1998"">33:18</a> The voluptuous stereo type i argue did not derive from black culture. Black People were enslaved, didnt care or bring up the shape of their bodies. Whites portrayed blacks in media as big nosed big lipped big hipped. Once blacks gained more freedom black appreciation culture developed. Not only were they beginning to value their features that were previously oppressed they started to value all parts of their culture. Yes black culture can get it of hand and be super prideful but to say that blacks caused the beauty standard to be this way is crazy. Appreciation of what was previously unappreciated did not cause y’all to not like your bodies. And for you to say Chinese bodies are “made like this” which is why you wanted to change yours is crazy. Imagine your daughter hearing that… and don’t blame black people for the comparison YOU made 😢; The amount of money the plastic surgeon probably spends on “box’s of filler” to “restore” her face must be crazyyyy if she crashed out like that and felt comfortable telling that story like it wasn’t insanely sad. The filler upkeep must be hard work.; Daphnes inspiration photo for her facial work must’ve been that Woah Vicky chic. Hopefully her future daughters work doesn’t make her look like an aged woah Vicky as well (let’s be honest her daughters getting work done having Daphne as a mom if she still thinks like this as a mother one day…).; The women here self-proclaiming they’re victims of the plastic surgery industry are only victims of themselves. Where’s the accountability?<br><br>PS: I’m not against plastic surgery. It’s a personal choice. And I just dislike self-proclaims victims who lack accountability.; Needed a older natural black women in this , too much sugar coating stil😂; How bout when their kids don’t come out looking like them😅😂; It’s a bunch of sugarcoating fr, who gon let they 16yrold daughter get a nose job; I love this debate it’s such a mature and respectful environment; The naturally beautiful hippy woman is actually beautiful. But she can only speak because she has been so blessed 🎉 FOR THE REST OF YALL MFs better get it together 😂 It&#39;s not gonna get any better because women have children with some questionable men because they have money. So plastic surgery is going to be in more demand, less beautiful people are going to be born(ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL, NOT THAT MAKE BELIEVE NONSENSE).; Great middle ground !

Buy lips, fix that nose, shave down that jawline, get a facelift, get some lypo. In the end we become a warped version of what we were in our youth. <br>Women claim to do it for themselves. Lies. We don’t. We do it to feel as pretty or more pretty than the next woman. <br>There is no “aging gracefully” anymore.

All their beauty standards are better than Korea.; As research says Koreans are 97.9% literacy rate even though mentality not fully developed only know how to maintain beauty standards beside that being racist to dark skin people very well Korea is a plastic surgery hub produce huge no of human plastic dolls .being beautiful is not everything; I have a feeling everyone in South Korea is miserable. And also not real humans. The innocent kids there are also miserable. Is Disney not popular in Korea? Disney teaches self acceptance and love and miracle and lots of magic. Happiness and sparkling stars to everyone! ⭐️✨🥳🎉❤️‍🩹; u are really funny 😂😂; Well...beauty is subjective😅; Koreans are obsessed with beauty <br>Me killing my insecurities and treating beauty standards as turd standards; This is neurotic at best; And I have some unpopular opinion about Korean beauty standard in my opinion korean beauty standards just make you has sama face or basically being twin clone with other beauty or handsome people in korean; Haha😂; Korea is too FAKE!  K-pop is fake, K-dramas are fake.; Insecurity is derived from need to fit in. It’s sort of global cults, different in each society. All problems start on  visual media,where super richness is celebrated and thus copycats,who would do anything to get closer to so called high standard. And here we have demand vs offer.; 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣; I also find it funny that chicken legs means thick legs in SK while most of the world understands chicken legs as being “too skinny/thin” and that’s the insult; I love your stori.

South Korean thinks being white like a paper means beautiful and it’s ridiculous; The shoulder thing is literally 90% genetics and 10% posture bruh; I feel like western beauty standards are more about the body than the face. And then Korean is body and face but heeaaaavily on the face; The hip pads are also used in Latin America a bit for women who don’t fit the curvy standard. It’s not talked about so much but some women use it. We do use a LOT of shapewear, though, and everyone knows about that. To the point where some people say that you “have to use shapewear to look beautiful in dresses” regardless of your natural shape or size. Even if you’re already so fit, you still “have to” wear it. The standards across Latin America is so wild because they want you to be thin around the middle but have nice abs, a curvy bottom and wide hips, and a big chest. Your legs also shouldn’t be too skinny. Basically, they want you to have a body type that barely anyone has naturally. That’s why there’s so much shapewear. Because to fit everything else, you most likely won’t be too thin around the middle. (A lot of men don’t care about the waistline, though. That’s mostly women.); 🤯😐; My dream was to visit South Korea just for once I was obsessed with koreans and their beauty thanks to kpop and kdramas but I m tired of them now. The obsession they have for beauty standards is insane so many plastic surgeries it&#39;s rare to see some natural beauty there, I m scare to visit sk now they might bully me for my looks. I have seen so many idols getting criticized for their looks. They barely love foreign members and finally they&#39;re toxic.; The beauty standard is really &quot;STANDARD&quot; in Korea. People generally try to define it as shape of nose, eyes, mouth, etc. The European and Russian look is the main beauty standard for korean. You may have noticed that always Ukrainian, Estonia, Romanian, Russian girls get much opportunities working in commercial advertisements and modeling. Because they have blue eyes and yellow skins. That&#39;s what korean like and they give preference to those beauties and it&#39;s honor for korean to have these girls in their shows/advertisements/movies. For korean, these people are brand and standard of beauty standard. Local Korean young guys and girls always want to be looked like a westerner. You may notice that the dying and coloring hairs is much trending now a days just because they want to have European hairs color.<br>I remember my roommate was a Russian club boy. He used to work in a club for whole night and used to bring always new Korean girls in the home. But he himself was very messy and smelly guy. He rarely used to take a shower. Always had a smelly and wet socks and wearing shoes inside the room. Rarely he changed his socks in a month. Once he proudly told me as he has blue eyes so it&#39;s easy for him to pick korean girls as much as he wants 😄.  He said he picked 6 different korean girls to the home in last 6 days. That was true. Even he went to Busan with one millionaire korean girl. But he had no return bus fair. I transferred bus fair in his bank account. So we can say that money isn&#39;t that much important for korean as nationality and look mater.; Korean language in comments affect this a lot too. It has a way to make any body shaming look normal, even funny. I’m recommended so many Korean shorts and videos lately.. and there many face-centered, beauty-centered culture that makes me want to escape the algorithm. For example, there was a big-size Korean girl dancing very well, but men and women commented: 꿀꿀 돼지다 ㅋㅋㅋ which means “oink oink pig lmao” but in Korean it was so normalized. In English comment section it would have been debunked but 60%of comments agreed.; Meanwhile im having trouble growing my inner calves lol to match my thighs; And the fact that not only women but also man are forced to follow this toxic beauty standards BS💀; One thing that disturbs Me is the double kid surgery because almost all Koreans have monolids.The beauty cosmetic surgery industry will really benefit.I loooove monolids I find then sooooo cute.; I&#39;m a Muslim and I cover myself and wear clothes that covers my whole body but now I feel so grateful for that, can&#39;t imagine what y&#39;all have to go through 😔; Korean Women, in my opinion, are some of the most beautiful Women on the planet. I just don&#39;t understand the overuse of the makeup. (the oily look or too much applied); me , as a black person looking at them with their &#39;dark&#39; armpits: <br>👁️👄👁️; Ok; When it comes to Korean beauty standard it makes me hate Korea, we Indians are much better than this.; Whenever you feel bad about your appearance, you can be sure there is someone who will profit from it...; K-beauty standards in two word : RIDICULOUSLY UNREALISTIC !!! 😅<br>but there is one korean guy who&#39;s close to those standards : Cha Eun Wo from ASTRO. From brain, manners, beauty, style and postures nearly 9.5/10. 😅; Lol the neck muscle thing. Some people will be naturally sloped and some more angular. It is literally either genetic or changes due to lifting weights to build your traps up. Also like so not having calves is pretty?!; Can you say that many Korean people are mentally ill? because they are too obsessed with false beauty standards.; Our country !   nope!!!!! 😂<br>&quot; We Won&#39;t have these Beauty Standards &quot; <br>Just we have Makeup Standards  and<br>We have good Healthy  body 😅<br>We have no tension  and nothing nothing!!! 😂; Korea only focused on beauty standard so much; K-pop fans stanning people for looks (Clearly post cosmetic surgery and makeup) got me really confused. Are people losing their minds these days? Isn&#39;t it supposed to be about music and dance?; damn south korea doesn’t want me to have traps that’s crazy; My favourite part was to make straight legs look like they are crooked 😂; Kind of craze Korea has for beauty that it will eventually result in going too casual about it pretty soon.; &#39;Skinny Obesity&#39; is what lots of Korean young girls fear about.  Even if you do not weigh too much, I mean your weight is under normal level, still you have plenty fat inside your body and they simply don&#39;t eat to tragedy sometimes.; I know how much obsessed Korean women are.  The K standard is really detailed, literally they find out problems in every small parts all over the body. And there are some products of solution for all the detailed problems. <br>But thanks to the Korean standards, we can enjoy various beauty products.  Koreans sacrifices themselves for other countries.; Strange thing is that i think i fit with all the korean beauty standards and i m italian ahah whats wrong with me; You are so sweet. Be ease on yourself it’s not like some law written it must be like that.  You can be pretty on your own way why to go after typical standards; Great video. I am always confused about one thing. When people say they are pressured (specially women) by society to have certain standards what does it meant ? What that pressure they are talking about ? Why they have to go with the trend and all have to look alike sort of thing? I am honestly curious when everyone says specially celebrities pressured to be skinny and so on. It’s like they chose that career path and taking some care of the body is needed as they get paid millions to portrait themselves so but work is not that much to talk about.; The reason Koreans women are generally pretty is because of great bone structure and nice skin. Their big eyes are set at the right angle to enhance their beauty!; Last conclusion : you cannot be yourself anyway <br><br><br>Thank god i am not korean; In my country we care about natural beauty a lot.; pt 2?; I just love her personality 💜😂; I was laughing out loud when you were talking about your pads.....OMG...; i think when people hear of south korea they think of BTS and Kpop idols and kdramas and they make these fake secanarios and fantasize about things that are never gonna happen. they think korea is all butteflies and rainbows but speaking honestly the south korean society is SO toxic. to everyone who thinks they will have a love story like in kdramas well then youre hella delusional... people need to stop praising this country and thinking nothing is wrong with it  &quot;because its south korea.&quot; <br>while this country has positives it also has heaps of negatives which one one really talks about. i think everyone is beautfiul in their own way and you dont need to fit in to the korean beauty standards to be pretty. dont look at those kpop idols who probably starve themselves because thats what they are told to do. they shouldnt be your role model, you should be your own role model and do what YOU wanna do with your life. let them judge you but dont degrade your self to THEIR standards. you are your own preson and even if you dont have a slim body or fair skin it doesnt mean anything.; Krazyy, I don’t have to change myself to be accepted by others.  People care, but only for a while.; &quot;We are all born so beautiful, the greatest tragedy is being convinced we are not&quot;<br>~Rupi Kaur, Milk and Honey; Women without double eyelids kinda look sexy to me. I don&#39;t know why women in Asian countries think they think they don&#39;t look good without double eyelids. Be confident of how you look. Asian women are cute and pretty.; Women without double eyelids kinda look sexy to me. I don&#39;t know why women in Asian countries think they think they don&#39;t look good without double eyelids. Be confident of how you look. Asian women are cute and pretty.; Women without double eyelids kinda look sexy to me. I don&#39;t know why women in Asian countries think they think they don&#39;t look good without double eyelids. Be confident of how you look. Asian women are cute and pretty.; Objectification theory:<br><br>&quot;Any movement toward gender equality that threatens the stability of the patriarchy is followed inevitably by a heightened emphasis on unrealistic beauty standards and increasing pressure to meet these standards. Such pressure may be effectively applied as a means to oppress women and maintain patriarchal control, as unrealistic standards such as these undermine women&#39;s self-confidence and materially shift their focus away from their individual capabilities to more generalized and superficial aspects of their physical appearance.&quot;; &quot;Learn love yourself&quot;<br>- Kim Namjoon<br><br>I also have a skincare routine, but I won&#39;t become so skin concious that I have to get surgeries or be ashamed of my skin. I live in India, and I am very confident because everyone around me has a normal tanned skin.; the pillow one,i don’t think that anyone really care about your neck; we dont have that kind of ads like this in bangladesh; Aloha greetings Sacred Divine Sovereign Goddess SiStar, You are beautiful authentic and Divine in all your beingness, Gorgeousness indeedo!!! LovExpresse 2 You and All Light Family, Blessed Be, &lt;3 &lt;3 D; Makes me worried about the beauty standards korea is pushing to the world, When I was asked by girls younger than me the type of girls i like when I showed them the girls i like and they saw most of them are tanned or browned skinned, they see me as a weird guy with weird beauty standards.; One of the thins I hate about these ads is that they used filters and photoshop for the end result so they are intentionally creating and preying on insecurities that their product aren&#39;t gonna change 🙄 so in the end all they&#39;re doing is making people insecure about things we might&#39;ve not even thought about before.; I one thing which I hate about korea is that....they give importance for looks and appearance...; Btw, I love your hair 😻💖; I really like what you tells us. I haven&#39;t been to Korean  they care about so many things afraid to come because I don&#39;t like to put make-up we need to be confident our self 😃; I love myself because of 3 reasons<br>1. I am beautiful the way god created me, why should I hate myself? If I see beauty in something, I’m not gonna wait for others to agree. <br>2. Beauty is subjective. Just because a few people don’t find me beautiful does not mean that all 7B will find me that same way. Each individual has their own idea of beauty so why should we waste our time trying to fit their ideas? <br>3. Self love is rebellion against society. We live in a world that profits off of self doubt and insecurity, why should I become a consumer and let them profit off of me like a puppet? Nope, I love myself and I encourage all of you to love yourself too. It’s not hard, but takes time. ❤️; Hey, I’m following you from Egypt and it’s far away from you first of all I’m thankful for your channel, because I think it’s great to know about the others. Secondly I think all of the world has something like that not like you but everybody wants to be beautiful to look great to get more likes from other people and I think that’s because we forgot that we’re all humans and our beauty shows when we appreciate our differences; in austria we say <br>rund und gsund<br>(round and healthy) <br>basically its an excuse for having a bierbauch ( a beer tummy ); Interesting information!!!!; Ugh the people in this comment section are so funny.....do you ever look at comments and wish you wrote it? I am feeling that right now😂😂; Ok shut up got me🤣; Tbh all these and more are also applied in other countries.; Remove your makeup be natural 😉; Thank god i didnt know about this while i was a teenager. It would have definitely made me even more insecure.; I actually have insecurities just from wacthing you with your make up; haha cute, catchy and informative presentation &gt;.&lt;; The urges to look prettier can never be satisfied ,and there is only one goal this path leads to... depression and anxiety; In Africa and the most Arabic country. fat girl is more beautiful; In Africa fat girl is more beautiful; MISS JINA KIM YOUR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NO NEED FOR PLASTIC SURGERIES BECAUSE YOUR BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.","Why you can NEVER be pretty in Korea!

Even if you do not weigh too much, I mean your weight is under normal level, still you have plenty fat inside your body and they simply don&#39;t eat to tragedy sometimes.; I know how much obsessed Korean women are.  The K standard is really detailed, literally they find out problems in every small parts all over the body.

Be ease on yourself it’s not like some law written it must be like that.  You can be pretty on your own way why to go after typical standards; Great video. I am always confused about one thing. When people say they are pressured (specially women) by society to have certain standards what does it meant ? What that pressure they are talking about ? Why they have to go with the trend and all have to look alike sort of thing? I am honestly curious when everyone says specially celebrities pressured to be skinny and so on. It’s like they chose that career path and taking some care of the body is needed as they get paid millions to portrait themselves so but work is not that much to talk about.; The reason Koreans women are generally pretty is because of great bone structure and nice skin. Their big eyes are set at the right angle to enhance their beauty!; Last conclusion : you cannot be yourself anyway <br><br><br>Thank god i am not korean; In my country we care about natural beauty a lot.; pt 2?; I just love her personality 💜😂; I was laughing out loud when you were talking about your pads.....OMG...; i think when people hear of south korea they think of BTS and Kpop idols and kdramas and they make these fake secanarios and fantasize about things that are never gonna happen. they think korea is all butteflies and rainbows but speaking honestly the south korean society is SO toxic. to everyone who thinks they will have a love story like in kdramas well then youre hella delusional... people need to stop praising this country and thinking nothing is wrong with it  &quot;because its south korea.&quot; <br>while this country has positives it also has heaps of negatives which one one really talks about. i think everyone is beautfiul in their own way and you dont need to fit in to the korean beauty standards to be pretty. dont look at those kpop idols who probably starve themselves because thats what they are told to do. they shouldnt be your role model, you should be your own role model and do what YOU wanna do with your life. let them judge you but dont degrade your self to THEIR standards. you are your own preson and even if you dont have a slim body or fair skin it doesnt mean anything.; Krazyy, I don’t have to change myself to be accepted by others.

I don&#39;t know why women in Asian countries think they think they don&#39;t look good without double eyelids. Be confident of how you look. Asian women are cute and pretty.; Objectification theory:<br><br>&quot;Any movement toward gender equality that threatens the stability of the patriarchy is followed inevitably by a heightened emphasis on unrealistic beauty standards and increasing pressure to meet these standards. Such pressure may be effectively applied as a means to oppress women and maintain patriarchal control, as unrealistic standards such as these undermine women&#39;s self-confidence and materially shift their focus away from their individual capabilities to more generalized and superficial aspects of their physical appearance.&quot;; &quot;Learn love yourself&quot;<br>- Kim Namjoon<br><br>I also have a skincare routine, but I won&#39;t become so skin concious that I have to get surgeries or be ashamed of my skin.

I haven&#39;t been to Korean  they care about so many things afraid to come because I don&#39;t like to put make-up we need to be confident our self 😃; I love myself because of 3 reasons<br>1. I am beautiful the way god created me, why should I hate myself? If I see beauty in something, I’m not gonna wait for others to agree. <br>2. Beauty is subjective. Just because a few people don’t find me beautiful does not mean that all 7B will find me that same way. Each individual has their own idea of beauty so why should we waste our time trying to fit their ideas? <br>3. Self love is rebellion against society. We live in a world that profits off of self doubt and insecurity, why should I become a consumer and let them profit off of me like a puppet? Nope, I love myself and I encourage all of you to love yourself too. It’s not hard, but takes time. ❤️; Hey, I’m following you from Egypt and it’s far away from you first of all I’m thankful for your channel, because I think it’s great to know about the others. Secondly I think all of the world has something like that not like you but everybody wants to be beautiful to look great to get more likes from other people and I think that’s because we forgot that we’re all humans and our beauty shows when we appreciate our differences; in austria we say <br>rund und gsund<br>(round and healthy) <br>basically its an excuse for having a bierbauch ( a beer tummy ); Interesting information!!!!; Ugh the people in this comment section are so funny.....do you ever look at comments and wish you wrote it?

14 K-Pop Idols Before and After Plastic Surgery,KOOKIELIT,2024-02-17T15:00:08Z,There are many idols who had gotten plastic surgery but some of them have drawn attention to their looks recently due to big ...,8q0DlGZEidE,"jessi def still has fillers...; U included rm  who done rhinoplasty for deviated nasal septum a medical confirm but u left lisa who had done soo many surgery on her face 👀????? What about that ?<br>Have u seen her predebut pics?; every procedures have risks.. it is crazy that this is a trend.. beauty standard is crazy..; Aspa really scared me lmao 🤣; Aww Joshua is so cute when he was younger with that hairstyle and he&#39;s still cute ❤; Koop stans keep preaching abiut natural beauty  until you people normal looking Korean people then boom all that flies out the windows like its crazy the answer  is simple stop talking about others look we are all very different conparing yourselve to a rich celebrity  is only causing more harm so trust me if we maybe all loved ourselves a little more then this surgeries would  not happens as often but those idols face public hate from the very same people calming they want to change how the industry is shaped but you guys go crazy the moment someone looks like a doll lol you are also so confused  about what you want and hate on this idols then everyone acts suprised when they under the life like listen to the music and move on; the youth of today keep idolizing them as natural beauty..😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂; For the first one, kinda fucked that she wasnt good enough naturally but people wanted to know where she got her plastic surgery because it looked natural its so stupid; We’re not ugly , just poor; I wish people wouldn&#39;t say someone &quot;fixed&quot; their nose or eyes. There was nothing wrong with them in the first place (deviated septums excluded).; WTF! Those are NOT THIN LIPS!! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q0DlGZEidE&amp;t=206"">3:26</a>; One day, the entire KPop industry will look the SAME<br>They have already begun!; Omg are those rumors from Aespa all true? <br><br>I wasn&#39;t able to follow aespa&#39;s career from the beginning. They are already big/ super famous/ loved when I heard of them. I always think they&#39;re all so pretty! Are these accusations true? <br><br>Now I understand why some people say they are the most hated group. I didn&#39;t get it before. And it makes sense that their fans are extremely hardcore bout them bc usually that&#39;s the case, the more people hate ur group the more u will support them, like 200% more, 300% more lol; Why the nose of yeonjun in the cover is like that?; I’m totally pro to plastic surgery… because the objective is to increase people’s confidence and self steem.<br>For example,Teeth surgery is highly reccomended not only for beauty but also for functionality, hygienics, an to improve the health of the mouth. Rhinoplasty corrects breathing and anatomy issues and improves the harmony between other face features… so it’s not a big deal<br>The problem is others pressuring people, specially k-pop idols and actors to get plastic surgery, which should be completely up to them… if they doesn’t like or feel well with any natural feature they have, they definitely should get it to feel better with themselves… if they are fine on how they look, so they shouldn’t do anything by pressure or bullshit negative comments from others<br>You have to look the way YOU alone wanna look and don’t give a DAMN about random opinions! <br>I think those people who spread these stupid comments and make private questions and whatever else, should MIND THEIR OWN FK* BUSINESS and stop gossiping or complaining around about others appearances 😉; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q0DlGZEidE&amp;t=407"">6:47</a> i dont like that people call idols who’ve had a ton of plastic surgeries a “visual gods” or something like that. Im not hating on idols themselves, but people who say this stuff. Like yall thats all fake why would you make such a big deal out of it?; I feel sorry for them but also disgusted at the same time; Sucks that some of there “fans”have to push their own insecurities onto the idols and make them feel bad for how they naturally look; It’s honestly scary; The fact that she used an edited yeonjun teen predebut picture when he was like 13-14 with his edited and with  makeup picture at the paris dior fashion show at the age of 24-25 and then assume its a plastic surgery when its clearly just heavily edited photos and puberty; Korean ❤ buy original branded goodies 👜<br>In the same time<br>Korean ❤  plastic / fake face 😅; In my eyes beauty becomes irrelevant in a society where it is the norm.; Doesn’t every idol get plastic surgery?; Giselle 😱😱😱; I can&#39;t help it but say South Koreans are sick for this. This is really sad how they are forced to do this :(; if you want to instantly recognize plastic surgery on people first of all always notice at THEIR TEETH; yeonjun didn&#39;t do plastic surgeries; 😂😂😂😂 Im sorry but everyone of those kpop &quot;idols&quot; has had more work done to them than ill need to have done to my car for its entire lifespan 😂😂😂😂😂 they preach about love yourself to their audience meanwhile they couldn&#39;t even practice that motto themselves they have had more plastic and silicone put on them them than a bratz barbie doll right from the factory. Jesus man I dont think military fighter jets undergo as much body work as a  kpop star 😂😂😂😂😂; when was it when plastic surgery was frowned upon.. time flys by so fast there; These K-pop males look ridiculous and effeminate.; Im a moa since debut and since i get in kpop i never found plastic surgery that big deal that people wanna it to be,like,its part of the reality for me,denying that your fav kpop idol did even a minimum plastic surgery like a botox is very innocent<br>&quot;oh you fav did plastic surgery&quot; okay what do u want to me do about that? fly to korea and remove they implants? lol,i have aways noticed that tae and yeonjun did something on the nose but never cared,like i said,no big deal to me,i just here for their talent and music,but omg,knowing that taehyun made a whole rhinoplasty when he was 15 made me feel extremely bad for him,i dont even know if putting someone this young to do plastic surgery is even recommended to be honest omg; The fact that jessie was prettier before surgery; They honestly looked good before surgery, some even better imo; plasctic people they are crazy; plasctic aespa; Taehyun face is mixed jonghyun and jungkook; انوفهم كبيرة وبشرتهم داكنة مصفرة وعيون صغيرة فلا داعي لتغيير جنسهم; too low self-esteem; Where is lisa ?; Plastic surgery people 😂; Well - it&#39;s like all Asian countries; they want to look white/European.; Duuuuuude, that Yeonjun thumbnail as click bait is getting in my nerves.<br>Using a pitcure of him, in his teens and without make up to the compare it with a picture of him, in his early 20s, with make up and then say he did a plastic surgery when he himself never talked about about it is just annoying, to say the least.<br>People should mind less about appearence and focus on their talent, that is what should be appreciated.; As long as fans are willing to deny and &quot;defend&quot; idols will continue to lie or be silent after doing ps; South Korea is crazy lmao to think that so many people there think so higly of themselves but they change their whole faces; I agree to plastic surgery but only to a degree. Only if there&#39;s a health condition that needs the surgery. And some very rare case of what the surgery will do to help improve someone&#39;s mental and sociological health of a person. If and only if, getting it will really help a person positively. And not just because the company wants it or because people wants to see perfection. Just like what Knetz want to see all the time. Beauty standards in Korea is insane. What&#39;s beautiful in their eyes isn&#39;t the same in most countries&#39; eyes. I mean, I find some Korean singers or actresses pretty, but I prefer natural beauties over anyone who has something done on their face or body. I also like girls better with no make up on and still look pretty. But if make up makes them feel prettier, then be it. It&#39;s their choice and I respect that as well. For plastic surgeries, it&#39;s more complicated. But I agree that it shouldn&#39;t be normalized. Specially for young people who hasn&#39;t fully developed yet. I still can&#39;t process the fact that some koreans usually gift their child wanted surgeries as middle or highschool graduation gifts.; Kyuhyun just did double eyelid, nothing more.; Hahaha hyuna was a 4-minute member not wondergirls.; I hate Hyolyns plastic surgery. It aged her; I need aaespas surgeon; I respectfully ask you to confirm before you spread things, and the fact that you added yeonjun in this is just a shame.... Surgeries are fine especially in this industries but please do not spread unconfirmed things...; Jessi looked soooo much better before her surgery; Plastic surgery is not you; RM even after surgery looks hideous😂; I am a model. I have done multiple cosmetic injection and 3 times plastic surgery. I don’t care what others say about it but I am proud of myself.; Funny how you mention Jessica &quot;boosts&quot; confidence but she got so many surgeries she no longer looks like herself. Even if she did it under pressure first time, it&#39;s evident that she got other procedures more than once, she looked way more natural after the first surgery but not years later, she completely changed her face. It just doesn&#39;t make sense psychologically, how people who love plastic surgeries keep saying they loved themselves already but they keep getting the knife on their faces and body, it&#39;s the biggest lie and it&#39;s a shame they influence young people with such bad ideas. People calling aespa&#39;s clearly unnatural faces &quot;goddess visual&quot; is just shocking and concerning.; Beauty standards 😂. Koreans naturally butt; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q0DlGZEidE&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> nice joke 😅; Joshua&#39;s is so unnecessary. His nostrils are too high and prominent. I wish they&#39;d stop feeling compelled to do so much.; Korean Faces are Unnatural lol<br>Chinese and Japanese idols are much better.; I gasped when I saw Taeyang from SF9 recently...; Very sad, I don&#39;t think the reason why I love some of the idols is because they have this perfect nose. I like their entertainment capability; It&#39;s not strange if it&#39;s Seoul, if someone re-debuts in a different group with a different face. 🫣; One of the reasons I love Ateez: they took their most unique looking members and made them the visuals. They really said that beauty is more than the Korean standard. And it has worked out so well.; Jessie out here lying in 4K those aren&#39;t overdrawn lips, if they we&#39;re the whole overdrawn area wouldn&#39;t be moving like lips LOL; these idols ALL looked better before their plastic surgery. especially those awful rhinoplasties that make their noses look tiny and pinched. their natural noses are always better. it&#39;s so sad; Did everyone forgot wonyoung?; I’ve seen pics of idols before and they was beautiful. I hate that they are made to feel awful about themselves, are or pushed to do it which is ridiculous.; Jessi also had her boobs done and butt implants.; Damnnn Karina gives me hope lol<br>She looked so normal in her before, and now.. well we all know how gorgeous she looks.. ill have what she had; Before commenting about the rising rate of plastic surgeries, fans should look into theur own behaviour. They encourage or rather pressurise these idols into it by constantly commenting about their bodies and insecurities; korean beauty standards are crazy…; its so sad how idols looks get hated on😭like do they want us to make fun OF THEM THEN?? treat ppl how you wanna be treated; now they look good wait when they are in their 30&#39;s, hyuna ruined her face.; Y’all need to stop normalizing this .; This makes me sad for many reasons. First, endless strangers criticizing people for the face they were born with. Like you have a choice what face you have at birth and you stupidly made a bad decision.  Second, being criticized because you had the surgery that strangers pressured you to have. Hey!  It’s lose-lose.  And I have to say if these plastic surgeons can do such natural looking work, let’s all run (or fly actually) to South Korea ASAP.  This is only comparing old photos to current photos.  Age changes people’s faces.  So does weight gain, weight loss, stress, disease, chronic conditions.  All kinds of things can naturally evolve your looks, for the “good” or for the “bad.”  IF some of these apparent photo changes are due to surgery, it is almost all very natural looking and I am more than impressed.  Congrats! Most of us would do some of this too if we could afford it and could find surgeons this good.  It’s the bad surgeons and the random obsessed that really scare people away from plastic surgery.; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a positive thing that people start talking openly about plastic surgeries. The more people talk about it, the more people start believing they need it too. I don&#39;t see it as something we should be proud of. It&#39;s only a business. Some people only make money from our insecurities.; So guys wake up, the chance of having a naturally almost perfect face while being talented in dancing and singing is almost 0. <br><br>Literally all of them had to get PS. Idk about you guys as i grow older (im in my late 20s), I am losing my appreciation towards kpop idols because everyone tries so hard to be perfect. Having to have lived in Korea for 2 years also shaped my perception of Korea that the society wants to be the same. Literally everyone loves to have the same hairstyle, same clothes, shoes and do the same thing kinda throws me off...; I Don’t Care How These K-pop Idol I Love Them Who They Truly Are because that is what them anything special but they also want people to love them this why did listen to the people who are not nice to them at all.; Surgery at the age of 15 is insane! How is it even legal; The worse is that its done and encouraged on kids and minors! They&#39;re barely teens when they get worked done just to fit the beauty standards. Yet, their body is still growing, so it&#39;s very bad and can turn to be harmful in the future.; &quot;At least the hate comment stopped and she got more confident&quot;. She&#39;ll never be confident as long as she depends on others&#39; opinion. Becoming more confident is facing the hate and not caring because you know you&#39;re worthy; Beauty standards in S. Korea are  unrealistic and unnatural.; umm jessi def lying abt lip filler LMAOOO; What the; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth 😮; Very Sad to hear... people wont get to know &amp; see the real person with many doing plastic surgery; Tbh its true that many idols as well as other celebrities does plastic surgery..but some dont..i had a really big nose before hitting puberty..after that my nose naturally became slim and high it lost the baby fat u can&#39;t say i have done a surgery..so dont compare with childhood pics and day they&#39;ve done a surgery without knowing anything😂; I once told someone how I like kpop and the first thing they mentioned was plastic surgery.

They are already big/ super famous/ loved when I heard of them. I always think they&#39;re all so pretty! Are these accusations true? <br><br>Now I understand why some people say they are the most hated group. I didn&#39;t get it before. And it makes sense that their fans are extremely hardcore bout them bc usually that&#39;s the case, the more people hate ur group the more u will support them, like 200% more, 300% more lol; Why the nose of yeonjun in the cover is like that?; I’m totally pro to plastic surgery… because the objective is to increase people’s confidence and self steem.<br>For example,Teeth surgery is highly reccomended not only for beauty but also for functionality, hygienics, an to improve the health of the mouth. Rhinoplasty corrects breathing and anatomy issues and improves the harmony between other face features… so it’s not a big deal<br>The problem is others pressuring people, specially k-pop idols and actors to get plastic surgery, which should be completely up to them… if they doesn’t like or feel well with any natural feature they have, they definitely should get it to feel better with themselves… if they are fine on how they look, so they shouldn’t do anything by pressure or bullshit negative comments from others<br>You have to look the way YOU alone wanna look and don’t give a DAMN about random opinions! <br>I think those people who spread these stupid comments and make private questions and whatever else, should MIND THEIR OWN FK* BUSINESS and stop gossiping or complaining around about others appearances 😉; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q0DlGZEidE&amp;t=407"">6:47</a> i dont like that people call idols who’ve had a ton of plastic surgeries a “visual gods” or something like that. Im not hating on idols themselves, but people who say this stuff.

Jesus man I dont think military fighter jets undergo as much body work as a  kpop star 😂😂😂😂😂; when was it when plastic surgery was frowned upon.. time flys by so fast there; These K-pop males look ridiculous and effeminate.; Im a moa since debut and since i get in kpop i never found plastic surgery that big deal that people wanna it to be,like,its part of the reality for me,denying that your fav kpop idol did even a minimum plastic surgery like a botox is very innocent<br>&quot;oh you fav did plastic surgery&quot; okay what do u want to me do about that? fly to korea and remove they implants? lol,i have aways noticed that tae and yeonjun did something on the nose but never cared,like i said,no big deal to me,i just here for their talent and music,but omg,knowing that taehyun made a whole rhinoplasty when he was 15 made me feel extremely bad for him,i dont even know if putting someone this young to do plastic surgery is even recommended to be honest omg; The fact that jessie was prettier before surgery; They honestly looked good before surgery, some even better imo; plasctic people they are crazy; plasctic aespa; Taehyun face is mixed jonghyun and jungkook; انوفهم كبيرة وبشرتهم داكنة مصفرة وعيون صغيرة فلا داعي لتغيير جنسهم; too low self-esteem; Where is lisa ?; Plastic surgery people 😂; Well - it&#39;s like all Asian countries; they want to look white/European.; Duuuuuude, that Yeonjun thumbnail as click bait is getting in my nerves.<br>Using a pitcure of him, in his teens and without make up to the compare it with a picture of him, in his early 20s, with make up and then say he did a plastic surgery when he himself never talked about about it is just annoying, to say the least.<br>People should mind less about appearence and focus on their talent, that is what should be appreciated.; As long as fans are willing to deny and &quot;defend&quot; idols will continue to lie or be silent after doing ps; South Korea is crazy lmao to think that so many people there think so higly of themselves but they change their whole faces; I agree to plastic surgery but only to a degree. Only if there&#39;s a health condition that needs the surgery. And some very rare case of what the surgery will do to help improve someone&#39;s mental and sociological health of a person. If and only if, getting it will really help a person positively. And not just because the company wants it or because people wants to see perfection. Just like what Knetz want to see all the time. Beauty standards in Korea is insane. What&#39;s beautiful in their eyes isn&#39;t the same in most countries&#39; eyes. I mean, I find some Korean singers or actresses pretty, but I prefer natural beauties over anyone who has something done on their face or body. I also like girls better with no make up on and still look pretty. But if make up makes them feel prettier, then be it. It&#39;s their choice and I respect that as well. For plastic surgeries, it&#39;s more complicated. But I agree that it shouldn&#39;t be normalized. Specially for young people who hasn&#39;t fully developed yet. I still can&#39;t process the fact that some koreans usually gift their child wanted surgeries as middle or highschool graduation gifts.; Kyuhyun just did double eyelid, nothing more.; Hahaha hyuna was a 4-minute member not wondergirls.; I hate Hyolyns plastic surgery. It aged her; I need aaespas surgeon; I respectfully ask you to confirm before you spread things, and the fact that you added yeonjun in this is just a shame....

I have done multiple cosmetic injection and 3 times plastic surgery. I don’t care what others say about it but I am proud of myself.; Funny how you mention Jessica &quot;boosts&quot; confidence but she got so many surgeries she no longer looks like herself. Even if she did it under pressure first time, it&#39;s evident that she got other procedures more than once, she looked way more natural after the first surgery but not years later, she completely changed her face. It just doesn&#39;t make sense psychologically, how people who love plastic surgeries keep saying they loved themselves already but they keep getting the knife on their faces and body, it&#39;s the biggest lie and it&#39;s a shame they influence young people with such bad ideas. People calling aespa&#39;s clearly unnatural faces &quot;goddess visual&quot; is just shocking and concerning.; Beauty standards 😂. Koreans naturally butt; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q0DlGZEidE&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> nice joke 😅; Joshua&#39;s is so unnecessary. His nostrils are too high and prominent. I wish they&#39;d stop feeling compelled to do so much.; Korean Faces are Unnatural lol<br>Chinese and Japanese idols are much better.; I gasped when I saw Taeyang from SF9 recently...; Very sad, I don&#39;t think the reason why I love some of the idols is because they have this perfect nose. I like their entertainment capability; It&#39;s not strange if it&#39;s Seoul, if someone re-debuts in a different group with a different face. 🫣; One of the reasons I love Ateez: they took their most unique looking members and made them the visuals. They really said that beauty is more than the Korean standard. And it has worked out so well.; Jessie out here lying in 4K those aren&#39;t overdrawn lips, if they we&#39;re the whole overdrawn area wouldn&#39;t be moving like lips LOL; these idols ALL looked better before their plastic surgery. especially those awful rhinoplasties that make their noses look tiny and pinched. their natural noses are always better. it&#39;s so sad; Did everyone forgot wonyoung?; I’ve seen pics of idols before and they was beautiful. I hate that they are made to feel awful about themselves, are or pushed to do it which is ridiculous.; Jessi also had her boobs done and butt implants.; Damnnn Karina gives me hope lol<br>She looked so normal in her before, and now.. well we all know how gorgeous she looks.. ill have what she had; Before commenting about the rising rate of plastic surgeries, fans should look into theur own behaviour. They encourage or rather pressurise these idols into it by constantly commenting about their bodies and insecurities; korean beauty standards are crazy…; its so sad how idols looks get hated on😭like do they want us to make fun OF THEM THEN?? treat ppl how you wanna be treated; now they look good wait when they are in their 30&#39;s, hyuna ruined her face.; Y’all need to stop normalizing this .; This makes me sad for many reasons. First, endless strangers criticizing people for the face they were born with. Like you have a choice what face you have at birth and you stupidly made a bad decision.  Second, being criticized because you had the surgery that strangers pressured you to have. Hey!  It’s lose-lose.  And I have to say if these plastic surgeons can do such natural looking work, let’s all run (or fly actually) to South Korea ASAP.  This is only comparing old photos to current photos.  Age changes people’s faces.  So does weight gain, weight loss, stress, disease, chronic conditions.  All kinds of things can naturally evolve your looks, for the “good” or for the “bad.”  IF some of these apparent photo changes are due to surgery, it is almost all very natural looking and I am more than impressed.  Congrats! Most of us would do some of this too if we could afford it and could find surgeons this good.  It’s the bad surgeons and the random obsessed that really scare people away from plastic surgery.; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a positive thing that people start talking openly about plastic surgeries. The more people talk about it, the more people start believing they need it too. I don&#39;t see it as something we should be proud of. It&#39;s only a business. Some people only make money from our insecurities.; So guys wake up, the chance of having a naturally almost perfect face while being talented in dancing and singing is almost 0. <br><br>Literally all of them had to get PS. Idk about you guys as i grow older (im in my late 20s), I am losing my appreciation towards kpop idols because everyone tries so hard to be perfect. Having to have lived in Korea for 2 years also shaped my perception of Korea that the society wants to be the same. Literally everyone loves to have the same hairstyle, same clothes, shoes and do the same thing kinda throws me off...; I Don’t Care How These K-pop Idol I Love Them Who They Truly Are because that is what them anything special but they also want people to love them this why did listen to the people who are not nice to them at all.; Surgery at the age of 15 is insane! How is it even legal; The worse is that its done and encouraged on kids and minors! They&#39;re barely teens when they get worked done just to fit the beauty standards. Yet, their body is still growing, so it&#39;s very bad and can turn to be harmful in the future.; &quot;At least the hate comment stopped and she got more confident&quot;. She&#39;ll never be confident as long as she depends on others&#39; opinion. Becoming more confident is facing the hate and not caring because you know you&#39;re worthy; Beauty standards in S. Korea are  unrealistic and unnatural.; umm jessi def lying abt lip filler LMAOOO; What the; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth 😮; Very Sad to hear... people wont get to know &amp; see the real person with many doing plastic surgery; Tbh its true that many idols as well as other celebrities does plastic surgery..but some dont..i had a really big nose before hitting puberty..after that my nose naturally became slim and high it lost the baby fat u can&#39;t say i have done a surgery..so dont compare with childhood pics and day they&#39;ve done a surgery without knowing anything😂; I once told someone how I like kpop and the first thing they mentioned was plastic surgery. I&#39;m disappointed someone would think about this before even the music, but I i guess it&#39;s because it&#39;s so normalized.; Okay RM did that to make breathing easier cuz he had trouble breathing.

The unrealistic toxic beauty standards are deadly.,Ibrahim Kamit,2020-08-29T12:03:07Z,How I finally STOPPED dieting and started LIVING. ➡️ https://youtu.be/FcvxOhmHYFo More commentary videos of mine The ...,N6FWZ-TpkFI,"We have to cut these narratives out of our lives as much as possible. Stop following these celebrities, they don&#39;t care about you. All they care about is money and having flashy expensive things, which is so incredibly meaningless and not at all what life is about. Take a month off social media and you might not even go back. If you do go back to social media, have it as a tool to connect with your friends and local community. If that community is positive, of course. Go out and explore the world around you, you&#39;ll realize people in real life aren&#39;t so plastic. Only if you find the right people though, of course. It&#39;s not as hard as you might think. You learn a lot about yourself. I don&#39;t feel nearly as lost or indecisive as I used to. I no longer base what I care about around what I see on social media. <br><br>You&#39;re only promised yourself, you have to take care of and appreciate yourself and your body. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll never feel satisfied. Ends to relationships will hurt a lot more. I used to spend a lot of time on social media and didn&#39;t really have much of a social life. I developed an eating disorder and just wanted to be &quot;thin&quot;. It went from anorexia to a binge eating disorder and I am now starting my recovery journey. It&#39;s time to completely deny everything social media and society has taught me. I don&#39;t want to starve, I want to love myself and be happy. I want to be strong and healthy. That&#39;s what our true desire is even if we think our desire is to adhere to the toxic standards.; In one hand, yes.<br><br>In the other hand, trying to go the opposite route and trying to make feel people bad for being more atractive than you and trying to force you to like uglyness is pathetic.; Waittttttt, that Malaysia poster literally asking for women to wear proper,neat clothes during WFH (COVID years). Google translate first bruhh <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=353"">5:53</a>; i hate being flat and i hate that i compare myself, ik i shouldn’t cause comparison is the theif of joy but i can’t help but feel ugly; I don&#39;t care what others say, Goddess Method by Kyra James is the greatest beauty guide of all time; I hope it&#39;s time for a revolution in the beauty world. A book called Goddess Method appeared somewhere on the internet. The author is Kyra James. I think that book will change the beauty world. I truly believe that.; I feel sorry for anyone who hasn&#39;t read The Goddess Method by Kira James; how sad it is that there are females who will never read Goddess Method by Kyra James in their lifetime; to go through this life and not read Goddess Method by Kyra James is a tragedy; Since this video was made everyone is back to wanting to be skinny and white. Kardashians removed their BBLs, Ariana Grande cosplays as a south Korean lady everyone is on Ozempic.  Sad.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=353"">5:53</a> YoU’re so wack for using this as example. Do you even know what it said? It’s literally guideline for work at home and sharing house chores; I dont understand who these people are who set the beauty standards. We are all beautiful ❤<br>Noone is that &quot;attractive&quot; without airbrushing or surgery. This is such a sad reality most women have to put up with 😢You know the world is messed up when slim girls get called fat 😢; I don&#39;t understand how is it viewed as a standard, and not just as something to aspire to? Like there&#39;s Heman, and men and boys aren&#39;t crying over it, it&#39;s just cool, would be cool to be like that, but you don&#39;t have to, it&#39;s not a standard. There is no standard. I honestly think many women have a lot of growing up to do as well, just in a different department from men.<br>You have to understand that the problem comes in your language. It&#39;s not a standard, how can it be a standard?  Not everyone can be a hero, but we all should strive for it, without losing our minds about it, it&#39;s a good thing actually, but people are very immature emotionally. People just wanna go &quot;poor me, how unlucky I am, everyone comfort me how perfect I am already, and other bs nonsense&quot;<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=132"">2:12</a> stopped watching.; Great video. Beauty is always subjective and fluctuating, so just don&#39;t chase that. you are intelligent, kind, empathetic, brave, and fit.; “i’m friends with them because of how skinny they are! i’m friends with them because of how pretty they are!” said NO ONE EVER; Men go through the same ish. Where a steroid - like body is desirable for boys.; Fellas, is it gay to be pretty?; The end made me smile so much I love it; i don’t think the same way as my peers — i love myself!! i know i’m just 16, easily get tanned and wounded due to my lifestyle… but sometimes my friends telling me my skin is darker, my parents telling me i have an “ugly wound/scar” or pimples, makes me feel a bit insecure. i barely go outside for exercise during day time anymore when the sun is out and the weather is good.; I’m four years too late but this made me feel less alone and was a good reminder that I should only hold myself to my own standard, not other people’s. <br><br>I’ve never really done the whole social media thing so it was shocking to see how the media and these young girls think we should be versus what we are.  <br><br>Screw that - your message was beautiful and inspiring - thank you for the vid.; in the beginning of the video i only thought that your voice was gay and that that was that but this is such a woke gayass video; I keep coming back to this video to remind myself of the absurdity of our standards its really comforting in a way; Other people might not love you, but you need to learn to love yourself.; the video essay that got me into video essays; I saw this video late but i feel like i should say it. My problem has always been my redhair, it&#39;s of course a &#39;&#39;rare&#39;&#39; hair colour so it gives people a reason to make fun of it while at the same time i get almost 0 representation of it and actors who often have red hair, dye it or bleach it because it isn&#39;t the beauty standard. People have normalized making fun of anyone with red hair and now it feels like i need to hide it for the sake of not being noticed.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=1277"">21:17</a> what if were comparing ourselves to someone thats in real life😔😔; I was white in school and i was called a ghost 😢i never said anything tk anyone else but everyone attacked me for being white ì actually thought dark skinned people are beautiful and cute; really wacky and borderline unheard of idea here, but maybe, just maybe, we should treat bodies as vessels to keep us alive instead of trends and objects for the gaze and satisfaction of others; I almost got an eating disorder due to kpop and those months was the worst I had been in my whole life. I&#39;m still having some issues but I&#39;m doing so much better. So please take care of your bodies and get help if you star struggling!!; I will; Its sad. I’ve personally been experiencing a lot lately from being bullied and called fat as a chubby kid around family and friends. Not only school bullies but yes family and friends. And everyone around. NOW that im 25 and skinny im being told “u could gain some weight, u look too skinny now” like imagine… being fat was a problem and now being skinny is a problem for me. Its a problem for everyone basically. IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ALWAYS JUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF NO MATTER What!! Eating disorders may be a different story but always try to eat and do well. Hopefully things should come to terms am i right?; Why is bro so zesty; Man these beauty standards are shit. Honestly I barely ever find anybody ugly, like genuinely I don’t; I love your videos... please watch the language... I want to use this in my classroom.; The standards are so low that just not being fat (which is the default) makes you a beautifull woman straight away in todays society.<br><br>Id say the standards are too low actually. Look at a random picture of people at the beach from the 80s and compare with today...<br><br>The standards didnt get higher.<br>We hit rock bottom.; you guys  always forget arab/persian/balkan women; This video: &quot;White people want to be tanned&quot;<br>Also this video: &quot;Beauty standards are internalized eurocentric racism&quot;<br><br>Dude, pick one.; The world: &quot;uh come on just be skinny. your so fat. &quot;<br>Also the world: &quot;omg do you even eat.&quot;; Loved this!; Thank you for this necessary video!!!; Thank you for providing such an insightful, and well-researched video. This is so important. As a white woman as well, it is incredibly enlightening and so sad to see how these toxic behaviors have deeply affected so many, including our innocent babies. Makes me so sad yet opens my eyes to the realities.; ❤🧡💛; the bratz doll description in the beginning, I don&#39;t find attractive at all and never have. kardashians, jenners, etc. never found them attractive at all. sometimes, I feel like people act like I&#39;m supposed to which unironically pisses me off. like they presume to tell me about myself and what I&#39;m supposed to do? bruh gtfo here; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=1044"">17:24</a> HELL NO!  DESPINA VANDI LOOKS SO PRETTY WITHOUT THE EDITING.<br>😢❤ I love her olive skin, her face and hair, but they paled her skin so white that it looks less natural and snapped her waistline. 😢; well done vid; The lesson I got: Think of makeup as a form of art like painting and coloring is, not something you&#39;d use to change your features/appearance.; THANK GOD I attained access to THIS side of media; Like this is real…. every day I realize how big of a part my parents (and social media) are in my insecurities…. No glass skin? Burn your face with chemicals. Oh, you dom’t weigh 45 kilograms (I’m 168 cm tall btw that would be like deadly for me) you HAVE to eat less and be more skinny or people won’t respect you and love you. I recently found out my mom had an eating disorder (undiagnosed, she just accidentally told me about some stuff that made it clear) and it made me realize that I had once too :( thanks to these type of videos I eat more now and try to take care of myself and encourage my mom to eat more :); i love your video; it&#39;s crazy cause when I was in middle school, this guy was walking around and taking girls hands and comparing skin tones and when he went up to me and compared ours, he was like &quot;I wouldn&#39;t date you, I only date girls that are lighter than me&quot;. Colorism and self-hatred is so prevalent 😕; Please say &#39;Women&#39;; I was asked what I wanted to be when I was nine and all I could think of was &quot;skinny&quot;; I swear the Kardashian started it all. They ARE the main reason of us young girls developing body dysmorphia now a days. They have no idea how they are developing our minds and insecurities and how they have a huge influence on us. They need to be stopped.; Bro thanks, this vid actually maked me feel more pretty and good with myself, I love myself, I know I&#39;m pretty for me💜; As a 14 year old girl, this is so true. Im slowly realizing how i cant look into the mirror without feeling disgusted or ugly. Before i started watching a lot of tiktok, etc...I neverrrr cared about the little details that much but not its just the worst. Tbh i realized that in my eyes i will never be what i want to be, but thats okay because nobody is perfect. The real acomplishment is to finally accept and love yourself.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=77"">1:17</a>, true, all about being skinny. But while somehow still having a cartoonishly large rear-end + giant set of juggs.; People who don&#39;t fit into this long list of beauty standards in general are a lot nicer, down to earth, more accepting, and happier.; idk i feel like a brand can choose who they want to serve.. i mean if there was a plus size store for only fat peple thats fine.; i love you so much thank you. i cried; Spam commenting to boost (sorry); Spam commenting to boost (sorry); Spam commenting to boost (sorry); My family is from fiji and because of that i have many fijian features, so when you explained how tv was introduced and how people stopped wanting to look like their family it made me so disappointed :( our beautiful cultural features come from our family, but now people are disappointed and ashamed of it. also when other poc people who were saying they were ugly (especially those little kids) it just makes me so disappointed; My youngest sister told me the other day that she has noticed the girls in her football team are discussing about body image and how ,, skinny bodies show all the beauty and how guys want that”. She took that to her and now she watched out what she eats and looks in the mirror saying ,, i am getting fat again, can you help me look like the other girls on my team”. She is 10 years old.; I used to listen to this commentary video all the time and I full heartedly agreed on everything you said, but the ironic thing is, I developed an eating disorder years later.; i’m a black girl and i used to feel so ugly and i wanted to be white so bad. but once i left highschool i started realising how pretty i am and that comparing myself to white girls will do nothing but make me feel bad because without plastic surgery, i will never look like them. comparison is the thief of joy. now, the only thing i’m somewhat insecure about is my weight but i also like it because i love my round face :) black is beautiful, don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise; You are beautiful ❤; Not me hating on myself because I&#39;m skinny and want to gain weight; &quot;beauty is a promise of pleasure&quot;; Well said Ibrahim! I really enjoyed this video and how you explained how beauty standards will forever be changing. People are beautiful just the way they are~; Brown black is beautiful im fair we have alot of skin problems rashes etc. India and Mexican are my favorite tones but very dark Indians and African many our sooo beautiful. Down with colonization dehumanizations😢; Has long has I am beautiful in the eyes of my man it’s o.k.; whats helped me accept my own body is drawing my body type repeatedly, and seeking out art of different body types and perceived flaws with humans. it helps alot :); I just saw a baby calling her mom ugly in mall I feel so bad; Just listen to alessia cara&#39;s song scars to your beautiful.; I have friends and family ( caucasian) that bake themselves in the sun and tanning beds to get darker skin - which causes skin cancer. Tragically women with naturally darker skin are pressured to lighten their skin with dangerous products.; Ibrahim just want to say, this video opened my brain and my eyes like goosebumps. i come from South Asian country and this is so so common there. you included everything and massive thanks; Natural is beautiful no matter what skin colour you are! The problem is, the media and celebs telling us what’s beautiful when in fact they haven’t a clue what they’re talking about! They just want us to spend money on products and painful procedures which is sick and twisted! Stay natural because that’s what is truly beautiful ❤; before modern bras n support garments young girls weren’t “trained” to wear corsets or waist training devices- corsets were mostly utilitarian(which didn’t mean they couldn’t look pretty) as busy and back support. there were tons of different corsets- corsets for working women as well as activewear corsets ect. men even wore corsets because they they weren’t “constructive” it was literally back support.  the only cosmetic use of corsets would be tight lacing- which very high class women would partake in as a sign of social status(they could tightlace because they didn’t have to work and could sit all day); I have to keep this video; I worked as a kindergarten and primary school teacher, this breaks my heart.; i agree with the black kids because i have brown skin and it looks horrible on me. it looks so bad i would kill someone to have white skin. i never want to travel to europe because everyone stares at me. i don’t want to be a nigga!! you don’t know how hard it is to be black. you’ll never know! you don’t know anything about us! i know white is beautiful and black is bad and i am 11. because it’s true! black looks bad on me. and i’ll never be white; ❤this video; I am 13 now, but when I was 11, or even 12, I was soooooooooooooooooooo in-secured about myself, especially of my skin tone, since I am Asian. Like back then I admired so much about having pale and white skin, wasn’t too insecure about being skinny and stuff sine u was quite slim, but gosh the toxic beauty standards, it’s wayyyyyy to overwhelming for such young childern; alyssa edwards cameo PERIOTT; Boycott ralph lauren, VS, and the kardashians!; I always feel so sad for the Korean girl groups who are forced to strictly diet to uphold their career.; The young girl that was crying broke my heart entirely; Ever since I was like maybe 10 I always had a dream to be beautiful and get surgery one day; I reckon thinness and youth are correlated. The modelling industry is sick for it.; sorry that this is a bit long but I just thought it was sorta fitting<br>i am a black girl, that grew up on the country side of Germany. I was born in Leverkusen and spend the first 5-6 years of my life being surrendered by kids like me and with even more diversity. I knew kids that were white, mixed, black, asian etc.<br> but when it was time to start school, my family and I moved to the country side, which at the time we moved (around 2012/13) it was 90% white(german) ppl and my family was one of the only black families. as soon as I started school the first thing I noticed was that I was the only black kid, or non-german overall(if I remember correctly) so I stood out like a sore thumb. luckily for me there were kids (and adults) who didn&#39;t treat me like an alien or an animal they never seen before. but I still got bullied, mostly for being overweight tho. I still heard stupid questions like “are you made out of chocolate?“ almost daily. those were not many kids, but it still hurt a lot to me. <br>as any black kid I soon had the dream of changing my skin tone. the tv didn&#39;t really help much. but the more I grew up the more I got used to it hell im even proud to be black and my culture. <br>whenever I look back at these days I always wanna slap sense into my younger self but then I think to myself “This is what the media told me“ They told us that the only way to be beautiful is being similar to a cookie cutter barbie. and since we grew up with that we believed it. kids are easy to manipulate <br><br>just look at gen alpha. I have a 12 yo cousin who already does make up and looks like 16. im 17, never really used make up and don&#39;t have a 243245 step self care morning routine (no shame to that im just exaggerating). its not rocket science on why gen alpha is like that it has been shoved into their brains that they NEED make up to achieve clear (light) skin to be called beautiful <br>my philosophy on beauty is “if I feel beautiful, than I am beautiful“; My mom instilled it in my head since a young age that I was ugly when speaking about me to her friends and family, today I’m constantly having to ask people if I’m pretty and seeking the validation from older men; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=405"">6:45</a> Thank you. I needed to hear that.; I have seen that society always judges a person. based on certain criteria.  When i was young, I was told I was too chubby, too thin, Too toothy etc.  by the neighbourhood aunties.  Now social media does the same thing million times more.; at 12 i literally developed a fear of people seeing my face because im so ugly and having to go to school was torture; This was a really good  video thank you; This video needs to explode way more than it should, extremely well put together; 🤍💟; I feel like, as an &#39;artist&#39; who likes drawing portraits, imperfection is what makes it fun. All those little wrinkles, those beauty marks, those changes in color, those special traits are what makes it feel like an adventure exploring the physical facets of human beings, bc though the insides are what actually &#39;matters&#39; the outsides speak volumes about the insides. This is what makes to me even more interesting drawing older ppl! You see the evolution of their traits and how different pressures affected how they look. It also looks like you&#39;re good at it because of how intricate the drawing looks at the end haha; This came too late, I&#39;m already a few shades lighter than I was, but from now on I will be loving my body, my nose, my mouth and forehead and my feet.","The unrealistic toxic beauty standards are deadly. How I finally STOPPED dieting and started LIVING. ➡️ https://youtu.be/FcvxOhmHYFo More commentary videos of mine The ... We have to cut these narratives out of our lives as much as possible. Stop following these celebrities, they don&#39;t care about you. All they care about is money and having flashy expensive things, which is so incredibly meaningless and not at all what life is about. Take a month off social media and you might not even go back. If you do go back to social media, have it as a tool to connect with your friends and local community. If that community is positive, of course. Go out and explore the world around you, you&#39;ll realize people in real life aren&#39;t so plastic. Only if you find the right people though, of course. It&#39;s not as hard as you might think. You learn a lot about yourself. I don&#39;t feel nearly as lost or indecisive as I used to. I no longer base what I care about around what I see on social media. <br><br>You&#39;re only promised yourself, you have to take care of and appreciate yourself and your body. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll never feel satisfied. Ends to relationships will hurt a lot more. I used to spend a lot of time on social media and didn&#39;t really have much of a social life. I developed an eating disorder and just wanted to be &quot;thin&quot;. It went from anorexia to a binge eating disorder and I am now starting my recovery journey. It&#39;s time to completely deny everything social media and society has taught me. I don&#39;t want to starve, I want to love myself and be happy. I want to be strong and healthy. That&#39;s what our true desire is even if we think our desire is to adhere to the toxic standards.; In one hand, yes.<br><br>In the other hand, trying to go the opposite route and trying to make feel people bad for being more atractive than you and trying to force you to like uglyness is pathetic.; Waittttttt, that Malaysia poster literally asking for women to wear proper,neat clothes during WFH (COVID years). Google translate first bruhh <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=353"">5:53</a>; i hate being flat and i hate that i compare myself, ik i shouldn’t cause comparison is the theif of joy but i can’t help but feel ugly; I don&#39;t care what others say, Goddess Method by Kyra James is the greatest beauty guide of all time; I hope it&#39;s time for a revolution in the beauty world. A book called Goddess Method appeared somewhere on the internet. The author is Kyra James. I think that book will change the beauty world. I truly believe that.; I feel sorry for anyone who hasn&#39;t read The Goddess Method by Kira James; how sad it is that there are females who will never read Goddess Method by Kyra James in their lifetime; to go through this life and not read Goddess Method by Kyra James is a tragedy; Since this video was made everyone is back to wanting to be skinny and white. Kardashians removed their BBLs, Ariana Grande cosplays as a south Korean lady everyone is on Ozempic.  Sad.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=353"">5:53</a> YoU’re so wack for using this as example. Do you even know what it said? It’s literally guideline for work at home and sharing house chores; I dont understand who these people are who set the beauty standards. We are all beautiful ❤<br>Noone is that &quot;attractive&quot; without airbrushing or surgery. This is such a sad reality most women have to put up with 😢You know the world is messed up when slim girls get called fat 😢; I don&#39;t understand how is it viewed as a standard, and not just as something to aspire to? Like there&#39;s Heman, and men and boys aren&#39;t crying over it, it&#39;s just cool, would be cool to be like that, but you don&#39;t have to, it&#39;s not a standard. There is no standard. I honestly think many women have a lot of growing up to do as well, just in a different department from men.<br>You have to understand that the problem comes in your language. It&#39;s not a standard, how can it be a standard?  Not everyone can be a hero, but we all should strive for it, without losing our minds about it, it&#39;s a good thing actually, but people are very immature emotionally. People just wanna go &quot;poor me, how unlucky I am, everyone comfort me how perfect I am already, and other bs nonsense&quot;<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=132"">2:12</a> stopped watching.; Great video. Beauty is always subjective and fluctuating, so just don&#39;t chase that. you are intelligent, kind, empathetic, brave, and fit.; “i’m friends with them because of how skinny they are! i’m friends with them because of how pretty they are!” said NO ONE EVER; Men go through the same ish. Where a steroid - like body is desirable for boys.; Fellas, is it gay to be pretty?; The end made me smile so much I love it; i don’t think the same way as my peers — i love myself!! i know i’m just 16, easily get tanned and wounded due to my lifestyle… but sometimes my friends telling me my skin is darker, my parents telling me i have an “ugly wound/scar” or pimples, makes me feel a bit insecure. i barely go outside for exercise during day time anymore when the sun is out and the weather is good.; I’m four years too late but this made me feel less alone and was a good reminder that I should only hold myself to my own standard, not other people’s. <br><br>I’ve never really done the whole social media thing so it was shocking to see how the media and these young girls think we should be versus what we are.  <br><br>Screw that - your message was beautiful and inspiring - thank you for the vid.; in the beginning of the video i only thought that your voice was gay and that that was that but this is such a woke gayass video; I keep coming back to this video to remind myself of the absurdity of our standards its really comforting in a way; Other people might not love you, but you need to learn to love yourself.; the video essay that got me into video essays; I saw this video late but i feel like i should say it. My problem has always been my redhair, it&#39;s of course a &#39;&#39;rare&#39;&#39; hair colour so it gives people a reason to make fun of it while at the same time i get almost 0 representation of it and actors who often have red hair, dye it or bleach it because it isn&#39;t the beauty standard. People have normalized making fun of anyone with red hair and now it feels like i need to hide it for the sake of not being noticed.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=1277"">21:17</a> what if were comparing ourselves to someone thats in real life😔😔; I was white in school and i was called a ghost 😢i never said anything tk anyone else but everyone attacked me for being white ì actually thought dark skinned people are beautiful and cute; really wacky and borderline unheard of idea here, but maybe, just maybe, we should treat bodies as vessels to keep us alive instead of trends and objects for the gaze and satisfaction of others; I almost got an eating disorder due to kpop and those months was the worst I had been in my whole life. I&#39;m still having some issues but I&#39;m doing so much better. So please take care of your bodies and get help if you star struggling!!; I will; Its sad. I’ve personally been experiencing a lot lately from being bullied and called fat as a chubby kid around family and friends. Not only school bullies but yes family and friends. And everyone around. NOW that im 25 and skinny im being told “u could gain some weight, u look too skinny now” like imagine… being fat was a problem and now being skinny is a problem for me. Its a problem for everyone basically. IN DIFFERENT WAYS. ALWAYS JUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF NO MATTER What!! Eating disorders may be a different story but always try to eat and do well. Hopefully things should come to terms am i right?; Why is bro so zesty; Man these beauty standards are shit. Honestly I barely ever find anybody ugly, like genuinely I don’t; I love your videos... please watch the language... I want to use this in my classroom.; The standards are so low that just not being fat (which is the default) makes you a beautifull woman straight away in todays society.<br><br>Id say the standards are too low actually. Look at a random picture of people at the beach from the 80s and compare with today...<br><br>The standards didnt get higher.<br>We hit rock bottom.; you guys  always forget arab/persian/balkan women; This video: &quot;White people want to be tanned&quot;<br>Also this video: &quot;Beauty standards are internalized eurocentric racism&quot;<br><br>Dude, pick one.; The world: &quot;uh come on just be skinny. your so fat. &quot;<br>Also the world: &quot;omg do you even eat.&quot;; Loved this!; Thank you for this necessary video!!!; Thank you for providing such an insightful, and well-researched video. This is so important. As a white woman as well, it is incredibly enlightening and so sad to see how these toxic behaviors have deeply affected so many, including our innocent babies. Makes me so sad yet opens my eyes to the realities.; ❤🧡💛; the bratz doll description in the beginning, I don&#39;t find attractive at all and never have. kardashians, jenners, etc. never found them attractive at all. sometimes, I feel like people act like I&#39;m supposed to which unironically pisses me off. like they presume to tell me about myself and what I&#39;m supposed to do? bruh gtfo here; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=1044"">17:24</a> HELL NO!  DESPINA VANDI LOOKS SO PRETTY WITHOUT THE EDITING.<br>😢❤ I love her olive skin, her face and hair, but they paled her skin so white that it looks less natural and snapped her waistline. 😢; well done vid; The lesson I got: Think of makeup as a form of art like painting and coloring is, not something you&#39;d use to change your features/appearance.; THANK GOD I attained access to THIS side of media; Like this is real…. every day I realize how big of a part my parents (and social media) are in my insecurities…. No glass skin? Burn your face with chemicals. Oh, you dom’t weigh 45 kilograms (I’m 168 cm tall btw that would be like deadly for me) you HAVE to eat less and be more skinny or people won’t respect you and love you. I recently found out my mom had an eating disorder (undiagnosed, she just accidentally told me about some stuff that made it clear) and it made me realize that I had once too :( thanks to these type of videos I eat more now and try to take care of myself and encourage my mom to eat more :); i love your video; it&#39;s crazy cause when I was in middle school, this guy was walking around and taking girls hands and comparing skin tones and when he went up to me and compared ours, he was like &quot;I wouldn&#39;t date you, I only date girls that are lighter than me&quot;. Colorism and self-hatred is so prevalent 😕; Please say &#39;Women&#39;; I was asked what I wanted to be when I was nine and all I could think of was &quot;skinny&quot;; I swear the Kardashian started it all. They ARE the main reason of us young girls developing body dysmorphia now a days. They have no idea how they are developing our minds and insecurities and how they have a huge influence on us. They need to be stopped.; Bro thanks, this vid actually maked me feel more pretty and good with myself, I love myself, I know I&#39;m pretty for me💜; As a 14 year old girl, this is so true. Im slowly realizing how i cant look into the mirror without feeling disgusted or ugly. Before i started watching a lot of tiktok, etc...I neverrrr cared about the little details that much but not its just the worst. Tbh i realized that in my eyes i will never be what i want to be, but thats okay because nobody is perfect. The real acomplishment is to finally accept and love yourself.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FWZ-TpkFI&amp;t=77"">1:17</a>, true, all about being skinny. But while somehow still having a cartoonishly large rear-end + giant set of juggs.; People who don&#39;t fit into this long list of beauty standards in general are a lot nicer, down to earth, more accepting, and happier.; idk i feel like a brand can choose who they want to serve.. i mean if there was a plus size store for only fat peple thats fine.; i love you so much thank you. i cried; Spam commenting to boost (sorry); Spam commenting to boost (sorry); Spam commenting to boost (sorry); My family is from fiji and because of that i have many fijian features, so when you explained how tv was introduced and how people stopped wanting to look like their family it made me so disappointed :( our beautiful cultural features come from our family, but now people are disappointed and ashamed of it. also when other poc people who were saying they were ugly (especially those little kids) it just makes me so disappointed; My youngest sister told me the other day that she has noticed the girls in her football team are discussing about body image and how ,, skinny bodies show all the beauty and how guys want that”. She took that to her and now she watched out what she eats and looks in the mirror saying ,, i am getting fat again, can you help me look like the other girls on my team”. She is 10 years old.; I used to listen to this commentary video all the time and I full heartedly agreed on everything you said, but the ironic thing is, I developed an eating disorder years later.; i’m a black girl and i used to feel so ugly and i wanted to be white so bad. but once i left highschool i started realising how pretty i am and that comparing myself to white girls will do nothing but make me feel bad because without plastic surgery, i will never look like them. comparison is the thief of joy. now, the only thing i’m somewhat insecure about is my weight but i also like it because i love my round face :) black is beautiful, don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise; You are beautiful ❤; Not me hating on myself because I&#39;m skinny and want to gain weight; &quot;beauty is a promise of pleasure&quot;; Well said Ibrahim! I really enjoyed this video and how you explained how beauty standards will forever be changing. People are beautiful just the way they are~; Brown black is beautiful im fair we have alot of skin problems rashes etc. India and Mexican are my favorite tones but very dark Indians and African many our sooo beautiful. Down with colonization dehumanizations😢; Has long has I am beautiful in the eyes of my man it’s o.k.; whats helped me accept my own body is drawing my body type repeatedly, and seeking out art of different body types and perceived flaws with humans. it helps alot :); I just saw a baby calling her mom ugly in mall I feel so bad; Just listen to alessia cara&#39;s song scars to your beautiful.; I have friends and family ( caucasian) that bake themselves in the sun and tanning beds to get darker skin - which causes skin cancer. Tragically women with naturally darker skin are pressured to lighten their skin with dangerous products.; Ibrahim just want to say, this video opened my brain and my eyes like goosebumps. i come from South Asian country and this is so so common there. you included everything and massive thanks; Natural is beautiful no matter what skin colour you are! The problem is, the media and celebs telling us what’s beautiful when in fact they haven’t a clue what they’re talking about!

I have always been a been on the darker side, and I remember this one time when I was 9, I looked in the mirror with 2 of my other cousins and I was upset with the fact my skin was darker. Since then, I have definitely got a much healthier view of my skin being darker, but seeing idols say colorist things makes me feel like the progress is being undone. It reinforces harmful ideals of being white-skinned and makes me feel like I am inferior. I am not the darkest of people and I&#39;d say I have medium skin tone, so I can&#39;t imagine what darker kpop fans might feel.; I have to click because of my love for TVXQ; so many shameless tvxq plugs and im here for it; This is sooo depressing! Tan and dark-colored skin are people! They MATTER!!!!!; Damn Cassiopeia; Frrrrrr; You know for 1st gen, having dark skin tone is the benchmark to coolness thanks to icons like Fin.K.L&#39;s Lee Hyo Ri and Sechskies&#39;s Eun Jiwon. They embrace their skin tones and rock it just fine on broadcasts and they prove that it cool to have dark skin tones. Eun Jiwon embodied the masculine vibes while Lee Hyo Ri embodied the sexy vibes with that skin tones just fine. As for today&#39;s gen, the only icon who is rocking dark skin tone is probably only Jessi.; I love the TVXQ plugs every two seconds lol taste 💅🏻; every time I watch &quot;I live alone&quot; almost every celeb hey show never allow sunlight into their house, because they are scared, they&#39;ll get tanned!! imagine living in the dark your whole life to fit into these stupid standers! It&#39;s insane. It&#39;s 2024 the whole idea about lighter skin being classier and more beautiful is outdated, no one is farming outside, and no one is getting education inside. this has to change for real !!!; Girrrrl who are you???? Let&#39;s be friends I need more Cassies in my lifeeee; western fans talk a lot about this but many times are just as clueless. Lisa now has her own company so she doesn&#39;t whitewash her photos anymore. we get to see her real skin tone now, and some people have been accusing her of artificial tanning like she&#39;s not a southeast asian woman; Man....now that you said that.. Jin Seok Jin become way.... Paler than he used to be in the early days of Running Man. He is not a Kpop idol but, even an old man gets colour correction... Bruh; The same colorism issue was true with VIXX’s treatment of N. He was made fun of many, many times by the members. It was so internalised that N used to feel bad for the staff because they had to work extra hard for lighting his shots in order to not make him look dark. At first, N used to try to hide his actual complexion until mid-way through he dropped it and embraced his beauty because N is simply gorgeous and one of the most attractive idols on stage with one of the best stage presence. And to me, as a new fan of VIXX, it was very weird seeing all that older content. It’s just incredibly ignorant and backward of the Korean society if they keep following something discriminatory just because it was said in older times. I know these issues because my country has tons of them. So, we know that we can’t change their society ourselves. But we can support healthier conversations by sharing positive thoughts with our idols, just as you said.; Personally I like East Asian people&#39;s natural colour, they look great without the whitewashing; <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4yWGOIQ5E&amp;t=19"">0:19</a></b><b> who is the idol / idol group??</b>; I wanted to change my nose untill i saw your video; I think it&#39;s something else. The beauty standards have become more rigid and likely the stars are taking some sort of skin whitening medicine.; They always whitewash Mingyu too; preach 🙏🙌; They are already so beautiful but the white washing their pics need to go away; A mere 16% of the world is white &amp; all of us irrespective of the society we hail from seem to be subject to a prefence towards those with lighter complexion. What is this if not a direct result of generations of racism, imperialism &amp; exploitation? If you are someone who &quot;just prefers lighter skin&quot; &amp; aren&#39;t white yourself, congratulations you&#39;re a colonial subject living in the 21st century.; I agree!! Also Yes to TVXQ fans!! I miss seeing Yunho, Xiah, and Changmin looking healthy with regular darker skin tones especially when it showed that they hung outside more playing sports and whatnot. JJ and Yoochun always was on the lighter side naturally :P; Can I make translate videos to Turkish?; glad it&#39;s not just me glancing between modern promo pictures of changmin and old variety show footage,,,,, truly where have they taken his melanin pls bring it back; If you compare Chanty&#39;s (Lapillus) pre-debut pictures with her music show videos, you&#39;d immediately notice the stark difference.; its so bad, they look like the wall sometimes; Seeing the Exo members make fun of Kai’s skin tone was definitely a shock for me when I first started getting into the culture.; Very alien-like. I’m really sick of the ignorance. Kids in elementary school are believing this BS and it’s affecting their self image.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4yWGOIQ5E&amp;t=236"">3:56</a> what group is that?; its funny because they arent even dark asians. i think south asians/ indians are more of that; You have to admit that white skin looks better than dark one.; What a wonderful essay!; “Melanated videos from 2008”, and it’s just a light skin tone; Ohhh lort the bad makeup.; ‘It’s our culture to tease people’ - I don’t care what your culture is or whose culture it is, if your culture is being a shitty human being, you need to grow up and change your culture instead of making excuses.; The worst part isn’t even the idols themselves, who often do apologise in the end, and genuine or not, it’s still appreciated. <br><br>The worst part is that there’s a whole group of colourist and toxic fans who will say that ‘it was just a joke’, ‘there’s no need to apologise’, ‘brown people always try to be the victim’, ‘why are you so sensitive’ and will gaslight and attack  people who give constructive criticism and defend colourist comments made by their idols as if their life depended on it. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I know they’re called ‘idols’ but some of these fans literally treat them like deities. <br><br>And some of these fans are even coloured themselves, which is the most pathetic thing to me. It’s like, I get you want to be ‘cool’ and ‘chill’ and somehow you think accepting being seen as a joke will allow you to be these things, but don’t disrespect your own community and don’t speak for the rest of us.; i still think about the panic some idols would go into when the vlive or snow filters would glitch during lives; I miss tanned Changmin 😢 he looked so good. Those filters are not doing him justice AT ALL.; Your country is getting White Washed,  like the US.<br>To bad and sad.<br>As Beautiful Human Beings we come in all colors.<br>I&#39;m American Mexican/ Native American.<br>I would never insult my past Generation of people by<br>White Washing .<br>To me it&#39;s insulting. We all can&#39;t look like ghosts.<br>If you are born light skin or white that&#39;s different.; Making their eyes and noses and cutting their jaws to look more caucasian is by far the worst beauty standard.  IMO.; Huge amount of Koreans use skin bleaching..but I also see Asians as white people overall; Fucking love tvxq, they&#39;ve been my favorite group for 7 years. Say what you want about Jaejoong but he pioneered serving cunt in the kpop industry.; on the flip side I hate when fans say &quot;omg ____&#39;s golden skin&quot; i find that just as bad bc it&#39;s giving yellow fever; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just technological improvement. Skin brightening and whitening cosmetics and skincare have gone so much farther now too. And most south/east asians will cover the hell up under the sun.<br><br>I was thinking of how in kdramas, the male lead is always ALWAYS tanned while the female lead is fair. Probly because it looks more masculine. In the same vein, as a south east asian, we&#39;ve always seen fair skinned girls to be more feminine. If you&#39;re tanned, it means you&#39;re active under the sun and most likely athletic. I know there is that whole historical classism aspect that spawned eastern white beauty ideals, but also the colour white is a symbol if purity. There are many reasons why asians prefer fair skin tone and big doe eyes with double eyelid. It&#39;s just a beauty standard that has been around for centuries.<br><br>It&#39;s not like the west doesn&#39;t have them either, it just evolves way more than asian beauty standards because asians are way more homogenous and traditional.; Well, duh. Lookism, colorism, classism, is the same shit recycled. If you’ve ever visited or lived in Korea, you’ll realize how kpop is only listened by a certain demographic and that everyone has melanin. Only most celebrities go through treatment and “skincare” to wash it out of them. Sad.; True. This is also seen not just jn Korea but also other Asian countries; I am a white Caucasian Aussie and have ruined my skin by too much sun-bathing when I was a teenager. I have been lucky to have lived in the United Kingdom for 40 years as I know that I would have had skin cancer if I stayed in Australia. I loved my tanned skin but what a price to pay. The other end of the spectrum is skin bleaching. My granddaughter is half-Filipino. She has beautiful olive skin like her mum, not the pale skin of my son. I watched a lot of Hong Kong cinema over the years and everyone looked healthy. The Chinese and Korean actors/singers are very attractive but sickly pale and very, very slim. I know it is the norm now but filters and skin bleaching is not natural and naturally olive skin is very healthy looking and attractive.; <b>This!!!</b> I think my concern is that SM ent, the company known for having their idols apologize even when they did nothing wrong, has historically never addressed issues regarding colorism.<br><br>The only time it has been officially addressed was when Giselle said the N-word a few weeks before their international tour.<br><br> BOA, NCT, Exo, Red Velvet, SHINee and Aespa have all had scandals regarding race/color.<br><br>If you think I&#39;m joking, here&#39;s some search prompts.<br><br>BOA (GOT the Beat): &quot;She was very tanned&quot; - refering to Hyoyeon<br>SNSD: &quot;She looks good for a black woman&quot; -Taeyeon<br>ShinEE: &quot;You look like a black boy&quot; - Taemin<br>Exo: &quot;I look like Kunta Kente&quot; - Chen<br>Red Velvet: Wendy&#39;s stereotypical impression of a black girl TWICE. (She&#39;s American 😐)<br>NCT: (There&#39;s actually too much) literally just type in &quot;NCT colorism&quot;<br><br>What&#39;s weird to me personally is that if they make these backhanded comments to their teammates barely 2-3 shades darker than them, imagine what they think about their SEA fans, American/Mexican fans, Indian fans, Mediterranean fans, African fans, etc.<br><br>Additionally, kpop companies are actively planning to release global/diverse groups with non-asian members, so it just seems so a disingenuous how fans can make the argument that &quot;oh, it&#39;s their culture&quot; when the company wants to promote to an international audience.; But thanks to kpop and its popularity, this crappy ordeal is spreading all over the world. The very reason i dont like the worldwide popularity of kpop is because of their very very superficial values.; It&#39;s so nice to see Jaejoong included in a mainstream kpop video for once.; Koreaboos are always making excuses for Korean racism; Have you noticed that the plastic surgeries have been going wild too? Like, Kpop idols got stuff done before too, but it was always kept as natural as possible. Look at SNSD around 2014 for example, or any group around that time and before. Even SM groups who were notorious for their visual still kept it light and natural, you could still recognize them and their beauty was still achievable.<br>Now, with the 4th-5th gen, I feel like ps has become a way to achieve something unnatural. They look beathtaking, but you know damn well no one looks like that. You can barely recognize them, and both girls and boys get the exact same work done, nose job, jaw reductuon, double eyelids, lip fillers. I don&#39;t wanna say anyone&#39;s name, but there are many extremely famous idols that look completely different and that have a look that is not achievable by the laws of nature lol. Though there are still many that keep it light and natural, the most popular idols have so much work done (compare the most popular female idols of 2023-2024 to Yoona and Suzy in 2013-2014).; KPOP is not a music culture any more, it became a souless influencer brand, now nobody cares about music anymore, new kpoppies just want pretty faces and grey skins.; Don&#39;t forget the bleaching added to skin care products.; She’s not the first black K-pop idol IDC. She didn’t speak Korean. She showed up in like 1 vid BARELY. She was on 1 stage. She was never with the group. She’s wasn’t a K-pop idol period and she looks nothing like a black woman.; What the heck is wrong with these people. All skin is beautiful. Kai&#39;s skin is very nice.; You are not alone. I am still fully waiting for a tvxq true reunion.; I couldn&#39;t care less about their colour. The main thing is that they are gorgeous 😍❤️🇬🇧; Unfortunately, this hasn’t changed since in forever. I’ve been into K pop since Baby Vox way before this generation. It’s never truly changed it’s still be as pale and maybe a super few were even allowed to be tan , but they would always make horrible jokes about that persons skin color. I even remember when MNet used to be shown in U.S.A. in the early 2000’s and they finally had Black women or men or darker tone Asians interview idols and the idols were allowed to make flirty gestures to them , but it was more fetishized flirting to be honest. But, of course when a white person would interview them they’re way more respectful. Nothing is new under the sun .; I forgot about the exo clip. That thing traumatized me back then. Haha. So unhinged!; It’s crazy the colorism yet Kpop is literally taken from Black Culture. Afro beats be used and they still hate us and our skin….. smh folks will take from Black culture hate the people who gave them the culture and still act like they are “good” people. Crazy. Us Black folks get the most disrespect, yet they always apologize like it’s ok? I mean wtf? It’s crazy.; WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL video!!!!! Whitewashing (as you pointed out) is deeper than what we see on the surface. Honestly, whitewashing makes you look dead not attractive (personal opinion). Not to say there aren&#39;t attractive me with fair skin, but they are not attractive because their skin is translucent but good genes, lol. I hope there will be a positive change as well.; People also forget that BTS Jimin called Jungkook the equivalent of a nigga in Korean on V-live once back in the day because he was outside in the sun all day and came in tanned 💁🏾‍♀like you can&#39;t make this shit up lol. They may not show their colorism as much now that they are international stars but we don&#39;t know if they still have the same views...they just don&#39;t want the backlash from it. Also, ironically, most of their fans are not pale-skinned.; They do all look so pale now that it&#39;s sickly!!!!!!!  I&#39;m almost surprised Hyori ever made it sometimes because she is pr consistently dark compared to everyone else!; This is besides the point but I’m just loving all the exo photos because I have been malnourished for a while; I also hate how those filters make EVERYTHING in the background of the photo/video so bright and white, and sometimes the colors really look off and unnatural<br>Okay you like your idols pale, but do you also like your trees white, and your audience blind ??? I literally can&#39;t watch some videos/dramas at night bcz even at lowest brightness it still hurts my eyes; Honestly the editing is hilarious and only dumbasses can be fooled. They look so fake. Someone tell them it’s ridiculous; The Shinee situation was repulsively idiotic. <br><br>MINHO tans. <br><br>KEY and TAE pointed that out. That deep color is not his natural complexion. He is not as fair as JOOHEON or WOOZI, but he is also not as dark as he looks when he tans. <br><br>And most Koreans find tanning a waste and an irresponsible behavior. THAT WAS IT. I do not get why they even felt the need to apologize for smthng so nothing.; jesus christ i miss those good old days; is this entire channel dedicated to beching about another culture in another country...; I wish I could see the clip because their favorite thing to do is edit somebody out of something and still a dealing with problems; Naturally fair or light skin and filters yes. But I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t mention glutathione injections aka Cinderella shots which are a very popular skin lightning option for koreans, especially idols who can afford it. Its relatively safer than skin bleaching creams, and is actually healthy for the body and does wonders for lightning the skin.<br>I mwan look a IU&#39;s younger photos. From beautiful tan to pasty white. She even has a dose of glutathione injections named after her. People go into these spas asking for the IU shot, lol.; I love Minho&#39;s skin color. He loves the outdoors and so it&#39;s natural; Junho ( to me) is less attractive pale.   In acting he was far more attractive in Rain Or Shine than king the land - I get that his character in the latter would be pale, but still… to me, he looked pasty and unhealthy; Felix’s vouge interview vs his pre-debut photos…; Also the makeup they use now is two -three shades lighter and use various products to blend well. Asians love to have white pale skin. Majority of them are obsessed with white skin. This is said by an Asian; I was introduced to kpop in 3rd gen and I always just assumed most koreans were super pale. Im nearly 20 years old and seeing kpop idols who don&#39;t look like ghosts actually made me think the picture was fake or edited- I feel so braindead wtf,I had no idea the white washing was this bad 😭😭; Asians in general and Koreans in particular are obsessed with fair skin. No news here; South Korea has followed the path that the American people took years ago, although white skin color is still superior in America, but the intensity is much less than before.; Some of the idol was so light irl,BUT, there&#39;s pinkish or yellowish hue on their skin; I remember when fan sites whitewashed Zendaya pics while she did a promotional tour in South Korea.<br><br>They whitewashed Zendaya.<br><br>Zendaya.; Off topic but the baekhundred subs took me BACK BACK damn what good times!; I own the BTS autobiography and I swear I can&#39;t even look at the cover cause who tf are those WHITE men??? Like why are all 7 of them blending into the white background when we&#39;ve seen just how tan and golden and gorgeous they all are? It&#39;s so disappointing how prominent colourism is and how normalized it has become to the point where even fans feel comfortable enough to edit the photos they take of idols to make them whiter than most white people. I&#39;m just glad that the Snow App has been outlawed in recent years LMAO; imagine being so entitled that you like a culture&#39;s music but demand they change for you because you disagree with their beauty standards. Korean has a history of appreciating fair skin way before they ever encounter a white man but this video is rooted in anti white hate and DEI mentality.  Don&#39;t push your diversity equity and inclusion (aka exclusion of anything that isn&#39;t woke) down our throats in Korea. Keep it to yourself and if you don&#39;t like how we do things here feel free to not consume our culture and music.; I stopped listening to K-pop because of the racism in Korea. So, people can understand I listened to K-pop when they had American artists and that was in the 90&#39;s . The music was real and not auto tune. And what you see was what you get. <br><br>I do not like someone wanting to be white when it&#39;s not even humanly possible because of your DNA; &quot;lighting&quot;. How long should I watch such racist videos that discriminate against Koreans?; Back then the korean industry wasnt as globalized as it is now. The country is a homogenus countrh as in most of them look the same unlike the case in my country  india , where everyone looks different, the &quot;racism&quot; in korea mainly stems from their lack of awareness, of course the ever exisiting  whitening fad is like present in all cultures in asia which is problematic; Significant presence and it’s only bts; I want to address the preference for pale skin over darker complexions in Korean culture.<br><br>The Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) in Korea had a highly structured and hierarchical society, divided into distinct social classes largely determined by birth and occupation, with limited social mobility. The main classes were Yangban, Chungin, Sangmin, and Cheonmin.<br><br>The lower classes, particularly those who had to work outside in the sun constantly, often developed darker skin as a result. In contrast, the upper classes, who spent more time indoors, typically had fairer complexions. This preference for lighter skin, seen throughout Asia, is more about social and economic status than racism. Lighter skin has historically represented higher social standing and wealth.; I hope no one comes for you because you&#39;re speaking nothing but the truth.; I freaked out when I saw TVXQ! My favourite kpop band of all time; jihyo dance the night away era would never ❤; natural white skin doesn&#39;t tan it burns . Koreans have melanin that&#39;s why they are afraid of the sun; These idols parents are not even pale I&#39;ve never seen pale korean elders so white skin of kpop idols is not genetic; Koreans want to be white so bad but most can’t even speak basic English 🤣🤣🤣 Make that make sense; who is it at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4yWGOIQ5E&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> i find her oddly familiar","THIS is why Kpop colorism and body image are worse than ever. kpop #kpopidol #kpopcommunity Social media and whitewashing are destroying self-image, especially for k idols.

I am not the darkest of people and I&#39;d say I have medium skin tone, so I can&#39;t imagine what darker kpop fans might feel.; I have to click because of my love for TVXQ; so many shameless tvxq plugs and im here for it; This is sooo depressing! Tan and dark-colored skin are people! They MATTER!!!!!; Damn Cassiopeia; Frrrrrr; You know for 1st gen, having dark skin tone is the benchmark to coolness thanks to icons like Fin.K.L&#39;s Lee Hyo Ri and Sechskies&#39;s Eun Jiwon. They embrace their skin tones and rock it just fine on broadcasts and they prove that it cool to have dark skin tones. Eun Jiwon embodied the masculine vibes while Lee Hyo Ri embodied the sexy vibes with that skin tones just fine. As for today&#39;s gen, the only icon who is rocking dark skin tone is probably only Jessi.; I love the TVXQ plugs every two seconds lol taste 💅🏻; every time I watch &quot;I live alone&quot; almost every celeb hey show never allow sunlight into their house, because they are scared, they&#39;ll get tanned!! imagine living in the dark your whole life to fit into these stupid standers! It&#39;s insane. It&#39;s 2024 the whole idea about lighter skin being classier and more beautiful is outdated, no one is farming outside, and no one is getting education inside. this has to change for real !!!; Girrrrl who are you???? Let&#39;s be friends I need more Cassies in my lifeeee; western fans talk a lot about this but many times are just as clueless. Lisa now has her own company so she doesn&#39;t whitewash her photos anymore. we get to see her real skin tone now, and some people have been accusing her of artificial tanning like she&#39;s not a southeast asian woman; Man....now that you said that.. Jin Seok Jin become way.... Paler than he used to be in the early days of Running Man. He is not a Kpop idol but, even an old man gets colour correction... Bruh; The same colorism issue was true with VIXX’s treatment of N. He was made fun of many, many times by the members. It was so internalised that N used to feel bad for the staff because they had to work extra hard for lighting his shots in order to not make him look dark. At first, N used to try to hide his actual complexion until mid-way through he dropped it and embraced his beauty because N is simply gorgeous and one of the most attractive idols on stage with one of the best stage presence. And to me, as a new fan of VIXX, it was very weird seeing all that older content. It’s just incredibly ignorant and backward of the Korean society if they keep following something discriminatory just because it was said in older times. I know these issues because my country has tons of them. So, we know that we can’t change their society ourselves. But we can support healthier conversations by sharing positive thoughts with our idols, just as you said.; Personally I like East Asian people&#39;s natural colour, they look great without the whitewashing; <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4yWGOIQ5E&amp;t=19"">0:19</a></b><b> who is the idol / idol group??</b>; I wanted to change my nose untill i saw your video; I think it&#39;s something else. The beauty standards have become more rigid and likely the stars are taking some sort of skin whitening medicine.; They always whitewash Mingyu too; preach 🙏🙌; They are already so beautiful but the white washing their pics need to go away; A mere 16% of the world is white &amp; all of us irrespective of the society we hail from seem to be subject to a prefence towards those with lighter complexion. What is this if not a direct result of generations of racism, imperialism &amp; exploitation? If you are someone who &quot;just prefers lighter skin&quot; &amp; aren&#39;t white yourself, congratulations you&#39;re a colonial subject living in the 21st century.; I agree!! Also Yes to TVXQ fans!! I miss seeing Yunho, Xiah, and Changmin looking healthy with regular darker skin tones especially when it showed that they hung outside more playing sports and whatnot. JJ and Yoochun always was on the lighter side naturally :P; Can I make translate videos to Turkish?; glad it&#39;s not just me glancing between modern promo pictures of changmin and old variety show footage,,,,, truly where have they taken his melanin pls bring it back; If you compare Chanty&#39;s (Lapillus) pre-debut pictures with her music show videos, you&#39;d immediately notice the stark difference.; its so bad, they look like the wall sometimes; Seeing the Exo members make fun of Kai’s skin tone was definitely a shock for me when I first started getting into the culture.; Very alien-like. I’m really sick of the ignorance. Kids in elementary school are believing this BS and it’s affecting their self image.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL4yWGOIQ5E&amp;t=236"">3:56</a> what group is that?; its funny because they arent even dark asians. i think south asians/ indians are more of that; You have to admit that white skin looks better than dark one.; What a wonderful essay!; “Melanated videos from 2008”, and it’s just a light skin tone; Ohhh lort the bad makeup.; ‘It’s our culture to tease people’ - I don’t care what your culture is or whose culture it is, if your culture is being a shitty human being, you need to grow up and change your culture instead of making excuses.; The worst part isn’t even the idols themselves, who often do apologise in the end, and genuine or not, it’s still appreciated. <br><br>The worst part is that there’s a whole group of colourist and toxic fans who will say that ‘it was just a joke’, ‘there’s no need to apologise’, ‘brown people always try to be the victim’, ‘why are you so sensitive’ and will gaslight and attack  people who give constructive criticism and defend colourist comments made by their idols as if their life depended on it. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I know they’re called ‘idols’ but some of these fans literally treat them like deities. <br><br>And some of these fans are even coloured themselves, which is the most pathetic thing to me. It’s like, I get you want to be ‘cool’ and ‘chill’ and somehow you think accepting being seen as a joke will allow you to be these things, but don’t disrespect your own community and don’t speak for the rest of us.; i still think about the panic some idols would go into when the vlive or snow filters would glitch during lives; I miss tanned Changmin 😢 he looked so good. Those filters are not doing him justice AT ALL.; Your country is getting White Washed,  like the US.<br>To bad and sad.<br>As Beautiful Human Beings we come in all colors.<br>I&#39;m American Mexican/ Native American.<br>I would never insult my past Generation of people by<br>White Washing .<br>To me it&#39;s insulting. We all can&#39;t look like ghosts.<br>If you are born light skin or white that&#39;s different.; Making their eyes and noses and cutting their jaws to look more caucasian is by far the worst beauty standard.  IMO.; Huge amount of Koreans use skin bleaching..but I also see Asians as white people overall; Fucking love tvxq, they&#39;ve been my favorite group for 7 years. Say what you want about Jaejoong but he pioneered serving cunt in the kpop industry.; on the flip side I hate when fans say &quot;omg ____&#39;s golden skin&quot; i find that just as bad bc it&#39;s giving yellow fever; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just technological improvement. Skin brightening and whitening cosmetics and skincare have gone so much farther now too. And most south/east asians will cover the hell up under the sun.<br><br>I was thinking of how in kdramas, the male lead is always ALWAYS tanned while the female lead is fair. Probly because it looks more masculine. In the same vein, as a south east asian, we&#39;ve always seen fair skinned girls to be more feminine. If you&#39;re tanned, it means you&#39;re active under the sun and most likely athletic. I know there is that whole historical classism aspect that spawned eastern white beauty ideals, but also the colour white is a symbol if purity. There are many reasons why asians prefer fair skin tone and big doe eyes with double eyelid. It&#39;s just a beauty standard that has been around for centuries.<br><br>It&#39;s not like the west doesn&#39;t have them either, it just evolves way more than asian beauty standards because asians are way more homogenous and traditional.; Well, duh. Lookism, colorism, classism, is the same shit recycled. If you’ve ever visited or lived in Korea, you’ll realize how kpop is only listened by a certain demographic and that everyone has melanin. Only most celebrities go through treatment and “skincare” to wash it out of them. Sad.; True. This is also seen not just jn Korea but also other Asian countries; I am a white Caucasian Aussie and have ruined my skin by too much sun-bathing when I was a teenager. I have been lucky to have lived in the United Kingdom for 40 years as I know that I would have had skin cancer if I stayed in Australia. I loved my tanned skin but what a price to pay. The other end of the spectrum is skin bleaching. My granddaughter is half-Filipino. She has beautiful olive skin like her mum, not the pale skin of my son. I watched a lot of Hong Kong cinema over the years and everyone looked healthy. The Chinese and Korean actors/singers are very attractive but sickly pale and very, very slim. I know it is the norm now but filters and skin bleaching is not natural and naturally olive skin is very healthy looking and attractive.; <b>This!!!</b> I think my concern is that SM ent, the company known for having their idols apologize even when they did nothing wrong, has historically never addressed issues regarding colorism.<br><br>The only time it has been officially addressed was when Giselle said the N-word a few weeks before their international tour.<br><br> BOA, NCT, Exo, Red Velvet, SHINee and Aespa have all had scandals regarding race/color.<br><br>If you think I&#39;m joking, here&#39;s some search prompts.<br><br>BOA (GOT the Beat): &quot;She was very tanned&quot; - refering to Hyoyeon<br>SNSD: &quot;She looks good for a black woman&quot; -Taeyeon<br>ShinEE: &quot;You look like a black boy&quot; - Taemin<br>Exo: &quot;I look like Kunta Kente&quot; - Chen<br>Red Velvet: Wendy&#39;s stereotypical impression of a black girl TWICE. (She&#39;s American 😐)<br>NCT: (There&#39;s actually too much) literally just type in &quot;NCT colorism&quot;<br><br>What&#39;s weird to me personally is that if they make these backhanded comments to their teammates barely 2-3 shades darker than them, imagine what they think about their SEA fans, American/Mexican fans, Indian fans, Mediterranean fans, African fans, etc.<br><br>Additionally, kpop companies are actively planning to release global/diverse groups with non-asian members, so it just seems so a disingenuous how fans can make the argument that &quot;oh, it&#39;s their culture&quot; when the company wants to promote to an international audience.; But thanks to kpop and its popularity, this crappy ordeal is spreading all over the world. The very reason i dont like the worldwide popularity of kpop is because of their very very superficial values.; It&#39;s so nice to see Jaejoong included in a mainstream kpop video for once.; Koreaboos are always making excuses for Korean racism; Have you noticed that the plastic surgeries have been going wild too? Like, Kpop idols got stuff done before too, but it was always kept as natural as possible. Look at SNSD around 2014 for example, or any group around that time and before. Even SM groups who were notorious for their visual still kept it light and natural, you could still recognize them and their beauty was still achievable.<br>Now, with the 4th-5th gen, I feel like ps has become a way to achieve something unnatural. They look beathtaking, but you know damn well no one looks like that. You can barely recognize them, and both girls and boys get the exact same work done, nose job, jaw reductuon, double eyelids, lip fillers. I don&#39;t wanna say anyone&#39;s name, but there are many extremely famous idols that look completely different and that have a look that is not achievable by the laws of nature lol. Though there are still many that keep it light and natural, the most popular idols have so much work done (compare the most popular female idols of 2023-2024 to Yoona and Suzy in 2013-2014).; KPOP is not a music culture any more, it became a souless influencer brand, now nobody cares about music anymore, new kpoppies just want pretty faces and grey skins.; Don&#39;t forget the bleaching added to skin care products.; She’s not the first black K-pop idol IDC. She didn’t speak Korean. She showed up in like 1 vid BARELY. She was on 1 stage. She was never with the group. She’s wasn’t a K-pop idol period and she looks nothing like a black woman.; What the heck is wrong with these people. All skin is beautiful. Kai&#39;s skin is very nice.; You are not alone. I am still fully waiting for a tvxq true reunion.; I couldn&#39;t care less about their colour. The main thing is that they are gorgeous 😍❤️🇬🇧; Unfortunately, this hasn’t changed since in forever. I’ve been into K pop since Baby Vox way before this generation. It’s never truly changed it’s still be as pale and maybe a super few were even allowed to be tan , but they would always make horrible jokes about that persons skin color. I even remember when MNet used to be shown in U.S.A. in the early 2000’s and they finally had Black women or men or darker tone Asians interview idols and the idols were allowed to make flirty gestures to them , but it was more fetishized flirting to be honest. But, of course when a white person would interview them they’re way more respectful. Nothing is new under the sun .; I forgot about the exo clip. That thing traumatized me back then. Haha. So unhinged!; It’s crazy the colorism yet Kpop is literally taken from Black Culture. Afro beats be used and they still hate us and our skin….. smh folks will take from Black culture hate the people who gave them the culture and still act like they are “good” people. Crazy. Us Black folks get the most disrespect, yet they always apologize like it’s ok? I mean wtf? It’s crazy.; WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL video!!!!! Whitewashing (as you pointed out) is deeper than what we see on the surface. Honestly, whitewashing makes you look dead not attractive (personal opinion). Not to say there aren&#39;t attractive me with fair skin, but they are not attractive because their skin is translucent but good genes, lol. I hope there will be a positive change as well.; People also forget that BTS Jimin called Jungkook the equivalent of a nigga in Korean on V-live once back in the day because he was outside in the sun all day and came in tanned 💁🏾‍♀like you can&#39;t make this shit up lol. They may not show their colorism as much now that they are international stars but we don&#39;t know if they still have the same views...they just don&#39;t want the backlash from it. Also, ironically, most of their fans are not pale-skinned.; They do all look so pale now that it&#39;s sickly!!!!!!!  I&#39;m almost surprised Hyori ever made it sometimes because she is pr consistently dark compared to everyone else!; This is besides the point but I’m just loving all the exo photos because I have been malnourished for a while; I also hate how those filters make EVERYTHING in the background of the photo/video so bright and white, and sometimes the colors really look off and unnatural<br>Okay you like your idols pale, but do you also like your trees white, and your audience blind ??? I literally can&#39;t watch some videos/dramas at night bcz even at lowest brightness it still hurts my eyes; Honestly the editing is hilarious and only dumbasses can be fooled. They look so fake. Someone tell them it’s ridiculous; The Shinee situation was repulsively idiotic. <br><br>MINHO tans. <br><br>KEY and TAE pointed that out. That deep color is not his natural complexion. He is not as fair as JOOHEON or WOOZI, but he is also not as dark as he looks when he tans. <br><br>And most Koreans find tanning a waste and an irresponsible behavior. THAT WAS IT. I do not get why they even felt the need to apologize for smthng so nothing.; jesus christ i miss those good old days; is this entire channel dedicated to beching about another culture in another country...; I wish I could see the clip because their favorite thing to do is edit somebody out of something and still a dealing with problems; Naturally fair or light skin and filters yes. But I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t mention glutathione injections aka Cinderella shots which are a very popular skin lightning option for koreans, especially idols who can afford it. Its relatively safer than skin bleaching creams, and is actually healthy for the body and does wonders for lightning the skin.<br>I mwan look a IU&#39;s younger photos. From beautiful tan to pasty white. She even has a dose of glutathione injections named after her. People go into these spas asking for the IU shot, lol.; I love Minho&#39;s skin color. He loves the outdoors and so it&#39;s natural; Junho ( to me) is less attractive pale.   In acting he was far more attractive in Rain Or Shine than king the land - I get that his character in the latter would be pale, but still… to me, he looked pasty and unhealthy; Felix’s vouge interview vs his pre-debut photos…; Also the makeup they use now is two -three shades lighter and use various products to blend well. Asians love to have white pale skin. Majority of them are obsessed with white skin. This is said by an Asian; I was introduced to kpop in 3rd gen and I always just assumed most koreans were super pale. Im nearly 20 years old and seeing kpop idols who don&#39;t look like ghosts actually made me think the picture was fake or edited- I feel so braindead wtf,I had no idea the white washing was this bad 😭😭; Asians in general and Koreans in particular are obsessed with fair skin. No news here; South Korea has followed the path that the American people took years ago, although white skin color is still superior in America, but the intensity is much less than before.; Some of the idol was so light irl,BUT, there&#39;s pinkish or yellowish hue on their skin; I remember when fan sites whitewashed Zendaya pics while she did a promotional tour in South Korea.<br><br>They whitewashed Zendaya.<br><br>Zendaya.; Off topic but the baekhundred subs took me BACK BACK damn what good times!; I own the BTS autobiography and I swear I can&#39;t even look at the cover cause who tf are those WHITE men??? Like why are all 7 of them blending into the white background when we&#39;ve seen just how tan and golden and gorgeous they all are? It&#39;s so disappointing how prominent colourism is and how normalized it has become to the point where even fans feel comfortable enough to edit the photos they take of idols to make them whiter than most white people. I&#39;m just glad that the Snow App has been outlawed in recent years LMAO; imagine being so entitled that you like a culture&#39;s music but demand they change for you because you disagree with their beauty standards. Korean has a history of appreciating fair skin way before they ever encounter a white man but this video is rooted in anti white hate and DEI mentality.  Don&#39;t push your diversity equity and inclusion (aka exclusion of anything that isn&#39;t woke) down our throats in Korea. Keep it to yourself and if you don&#39;t like how we do things here feel free to not consume our culture and music.; I stopped listening to K-pop because of the racism in Korea. So, people can understand I listened to K-pop when they had American artists and that was in the 90&#39;s . The music was real and not auto tune. And what you see was what you get. <br><br>I do not like someone wanting to be white when it&#39;s not even humanly possible because of your DNA; &quot;lighting&quot;. How long should I watch such racist videos that discriminate against Koreans?; Back then the korean industry wasnt as globalized as it is now. The country is a homogenus countrh as in most of them look the same unlike the case in my country  india , where everyone looks different, the &quot;racism&quot; in korea mainly stems from their lack of awareness, of course the ever exisiting  whitening fad is like present in all cultures in asia which is problematic; Significant presence and it’s only bts; I want to address the preference for pale skin over darker complexions in Korean culture.<br><br>The Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) in Korea had a highly structured and hierarchical society, divided into distinct social classes largely determined by birth and occupation, with limited social mobility. The main classes were Yangban, Chungin, Sangmin, and Cheonmin.<br><br>The lower classes, particularly those who had to work outside in the sun constantly, often developed darker skin as a result. In contrast, the upper classes, who spent more time indoors, typically had fairer complexions. This preference for lighter skin, seen throughout Asia, is more about social and economic status than racism. Lighter skin has historically represented higher social standing and wealth.; I hope no one comes for you because you&#39;re speaking nothing but the truth.; I freaked out when I saw TVXQ! My favourite kpop band of all time; jihyo dance the night away era would never ❤; natural white skin doesn&#39;t tan it burns . Koreans have melanin that&#39;s why they are afraid of the sun; These idols parents are not even pale I&#39;ve never seen pale korean elders so white skin of kpop idols is not genetic; Koreans want to

How Billie Eilish Sees Ugly Guys #Shorts,Celebrity World,2021-11-21T11:55:31Z,,EGIam-R8mjk,"Thank u God for making ugly people like me so that the one who is on your favourable can say whatever they wants; She sounds like a kid; I&#39;m 53 years old believe me. She&#39;s telling the truth!!!!!!; Luv ya Billie ❤❤; She&#39;s just being honest. ❤❤; WHO TF SHE IS????; BASEDDDD; No ı dont; Attention hook er has &quot;depression&quot;, actual depression looks like Rui Torres, he was a mexican that worked at Art Attack;actually charismatic.<br>I am handsome and would not give a chance to Billie,her personality is worse than her physics.; Jesus Christ …. What is wrong with our society; Same goes for a girl.; Quick game guys what he said about her seeing you as a 8 or 9 or 7 and a half, so what you do is this find out where you live and find out who the top. Guys are in your area certain cities have more attractive people you may be a 7 in a rural area or a 6 it spends on the chick but I would go to places where women are imprinted by men who look similiar to you.; She is still immature and dumb, got no ethics; Men DO RULE THE WORLD, regardless of their looks. 🤷🏼‍♂️; Why is she acting like she has experience with this; Are you fucking serious? As someone who&#39;s been ugly all my life and still is, all I want is to be loved. When you spend years being no one&#39;s &quot;type&quot; and have girls say &quot;ew&quot; straight to your face for asking them out, it destroys you. I don&#39;t think I rule the world. I think I&#39;d be lucky if anyone ever loves me. I just wanna be happy. I wanna love myself but I&#39;ve been giving every reason not to. But thanks, Bill. I know I&#39;m still ugly. Even though I don&#39;t think I rule the world, and I&#39;m not some picky dude who only wants &quot;the hottest girl,&quot; anyone who actually loves me would be beautiful in my eyes and I&#39;d want to give THEM the world. I can&#39;t control the way my face looks.; You give a depressed girl orange clothes she thinks she can shame people liter- istg because they got ugly clothes they can be judging, like ur still wearing orange clothes.. tho; Just because you date black guys doesn&#39;t mean you have to be black too or act like it 😂; When you never outgrow the edgy higschool persona; The empathetic gender; Lol she is 4/10, what a hypocrisy; This thing still has a lot to learn which she may never learn due to power and money and ignorance.; She needs help seriously😒; Blackpill always collects; THAT MEANS YOU WORK HARDER FOR HERR...<br>AS WELL AS OR ESPECIALLY FOR YOU YOURSELF FOR YOUR OWN SELF ESTEEM.. BECAUSE SHE IS TRULY SO SPECIAL TO YOU AND GEORGIOUS TO ALL OTHERS INCLUDING WOMEN..; LEAD A LADY TO A WASHER SHE THINKS SHE CAN DO A WASH....<br><br>YOU GIVE A LADY A LOAD, SHE THINKS SHE CAN MOTHER A CHILD.....; And she thinks shes hot 😂; Wat?; She looks like a dude; She’s homely as fxck 😂; Feminist double standard in human form; It&#39;s so true though 😂; She ain&#39;t anything special tho😂; Everybody who’s mad must be ugly. I see nothing wrong with this.; The guys mad over this when they be the same ones body shaming and slut shaming women kinda crazy LOL; She’s not wrong and give a fat girl (yes I said it whine abt it) a good guy she thinks she’s all that; Funny thing is that same statement can be made about you😂; Dang she sure hit a nerve with a lot of these commenters 😂😂😂; You date a 35 year old burn out....nothing wrong with older guys but damn. The neighborhood; 😂😂😂😂 she&#39;s awesome; I&#39;m ugly but I  love  me  and I get cheated on. But respectis love❤️.; Who says you&#39;re hot?; Her music is ugly if you want to call it music nobody will be listening to that crap 5 years now; How would you know💀💀💀; She should not talk about her bother this way; Dont generalize billie you should know better ❤; I think they see it more as a chance for them to keep going; girl?; But you are beautiful❤; Y’all really think billie is who she is because of “auto tune” first of there is no artist out there most definitely the one you like that doesn’t use effects on their voice and also that’s what live performance is for y’all know damn straight she can sing and is beautiful and she was right people who never had been fortunate with love or whatever because of their looks so a full on 180 because they do think they are something better or special now; Billie you’re very much subpar. Pretty mediocre if you ask me. Music is fine. Face is busted; Billie was mid anyway.; Wow what a horrible person; No ones ugly confidence is key.; femcel; Bro when I scroll 1 down it the same video; There&#39;s nothing wrong with &quot;thinking you rule the world&quot; tho 😂 that&#39;s literally just confidence.<br>But being an asshole is a completely different story 🗿 and people often just attract those who are similar to them. 😅; Billy is looking more gross; Its bc they date dummies. Whether he tall, short, ugly or handsome, he&#39;s a dummy. And they pick them out of ease and control.; He is one Angry young Man; What is this college party train-ran, can’t get a real man, no life plan, knock off Scarlet Johannson from Temu, one hit wonder yapping about again? 😂😂😂; She look like she stank.; Ya don&#39;t be horrible,thank god I&#39;m not ugly but fat I am but wasn&#39;t in my day,but also I was a good guy,so what your saying I relate to it,❤in my day the girls liked the bad guy; Billie I&#39;ll guy...; She ain&#39;t even that beautiful; No, I was nice as fuck to her and she broke up with me because I was texting her. Good morning every day.; 😂😂 and he still gets the girls every time; And you give a broke girl a chance she thinks she&#39;s the queen but she&#39;s still broke; I&#39;m offended. I don&#39;t need a chance to think that, I already rule the world; She&#39;s has enough metal on her to rival a recycling plant.; So strange that when women make a true comment about men - men make some vile comment about her career and 41k people agreed…. And the person who posted this bitter comment comes back to thank people for his comment fame … you people are cracked; Fuck that man !  It just doesn’t make sense…. You dress up like a homeless person with autotune🥱; If a hot girl gave me the chance I should be happy and treat her like a queen; No yall talking shi I want yall to go see her concerts ❤️; Ah, yes, grown men misunderstanding what Billy Elish went through simply because they don’t understand her frustration with men but would rather mock her for fun and think that she’s just playing the victim (sigh, 🤦‍♀️ ); The same could be said for women and for the male feminists/allies who may jump in to defend her all you are doing is helping to keep the patriarchy alive and well so the joke is on you.; Haven’t we all called someone ugly or rejected someone who liked us because of their appearance.. think back to when you were young; Ugliness and beauty is subjective.. not everyone is gonna think billie is cute.. who gives a fuck?<br><br>If your not the best looking but not an asshole then your not ugly, some of the hottest guys can have the ugliest personality ever <br><br>With women we have to shave, we cannot be a certain size, we can’t wear what we want without being called a whore and most men think we are gonna cheat on them, i was asked to send nudes which I don’t do and this guy called me flat and ugly as well as a slut .. if your a guy treat women with respect, same goes for women but if y’all can’t understand each other then how you gonna find the one? Like if she trashes you then leave, if he trashes you then leave <br><br>It goes both ways not just one way.; She&#39;s not talking just about looks guys- she specifically mentioned the attitude. &quot;Ugly guys&quot; doesn&#39;t have to refer to looks. I thought she was talking about the ugly personality thing.<br>Anyway, since when did someone saying something distasteful give everyone a free pass to shame them for their looks?

If someone has a big enough ego, it doesn’t matter how “attractive” they are, they’ll still think they have pretty privilege(which is a stupid concept in itself) and can treat people badly. And when someone “more attractive” goes after someone “less attractive”, sometimes just in hope they’ll be treated better, they’re not because of the “less attractive” persons ego. There mystery solved.","How Billie Eilish Sees Ugly Guys #Shorts  Thank u God for making ugly people like me so that the one who is on your favourable can say whatever they wants; She sounds like a kid; I&#39;m 53 years old believe me.

What is wrong with our society; Same goes for a girl.; Quick game guys what he said about her seeing you as a 8 or 9 or 7 and a half, so what you do is this find out where you live and find out who the top. Guys are in your area certain cities have more attractive people you may be a 7 in a rural area or a 6 it spends on the chick but I would go to places where women are imprinted by men who look similiar to you.; She is still immature and dumb, got no ethics; Men DO RULE THE WORLD, regardless of their looks. 🤷🏼‍♂️; Why is she acting like she has experience with this; Are you fucking serious? As someone who&#39;s been ugly all my life and still is, all I want is to be loved. When you spend years being no one&#39;s &quot;type&quot; and have girls say &quot;ew&quot; straight to your face for asking them out, it destroys you. I don&#39;t think I rule the world. I think I&#39;d be lucky if anyone ever loves me. I just wanna be happy. I wanna love myself but I&#39;ve been giving every reason not to. But thanks, Bill. I know I&#39;m still ugly. Even though I don&#39;t think I rule the world, and I&#39;m not some picky dude who only wants &quot;the hottest girl,&quot; anyone who actually loves me would be beautiful in my eyes and I&#39;d want to give THEM the world. I can&#39;t control the way my face looks.; You give a depressed girl orange clothes she thinks she can shame people liter- istg because they got ugly clothes they can be judging, like ur still wearing orange clothes.. tho; Just because you date black guys doesn&#39;t mean you have to be black too or act like it 😂; When you never outgrow the edgy higschool persona; The empathetic gender; Lol she is 4/10, what a hypocrisy; This thing still has a lot to learn which she may never learn due to power and money and ignorance.; She needs help seriously😒; Blackpill always collects; THAT MEANS YOU WORK HARDER FOR HERR...<br>AS WELL AS OR ESPECIALLY FOR YOU YOURSELF FOR YOUR OWN SELF ESTEEM.. BECAUSE SHE IS TRULY SO SPECIAL TO YOU AND GEORGIOUS TO ALL OTHERS INCLUDING WOMEN..; LEAD A LADY TO A WASHER SHE THINKS SHE CAN DO A WASH....<br><br>YOU GIVE A LADY A LOAD, SHE THINKS SHE CAN MOTHER A CHILD.....; And she thinks shes hot 😂; Wat?; She looks like a dude; She’s homely as fxck 😂; Feminist double standard in human form; It&#39;s so true though 😂; She ain&#39;t anything special tho😂; Everybody who’s mad must be ugly. I see nothing wrong with this.; The guys mad over this when they be the same ones body shaming and slut shaming women kinda crazy LOL; She’s not wrong and give a fat girl (yes I said it whine abt it) a good guy she thinks she’s all that; Funny thing is that same statement can be made about you😂; Dang she sure hit a nerve with a lot of these commenters 😂😂😂; You date a 35 year old burn out....nothing wrong with older guys but damn. The neighborhood; 😂😂😂😂 she&#39;s awesome; I&#39;m ugly but I  love  me  and I get cheated on. But respectis love❤️.; Who says you&#39;re hot?; Her music is ugly if you want to call it music nobody will be listening to that crap 5 years now; How would you know💀💀💀; She should not talk about her bother this way; Dont generalize billie you should know better ❤; I think they see it more as a chance for them to keep going; girl?; But you are beautiful❤; Y’all really think billie is who she is because of “auto tune” first of there is no artist out there most definitely the one you like that doesn’t use effects on their voice and also that’s what live performance is for y’all know damn straight she can sing and is beautiful and she was right people who never had been fortunate with love or whatever because of their looks so a full on 180 because they do think they are something better or special now; Billie you’re very much subpar. Pretty mediocre if you ask me. Music is fine. Face is busted; Billie was mid anyway.; Wow what a horrible person; No ones ugly confidence is key.; femcel; Bro when I scroll 1 down it the same video; There&#39;s nothing wrong with &quot;thinking you rule the world&quot; tho 😂 that&#39;s literally just confidence.<br>But being an asshole is a completely different story 🗿 and people often just attract those who are similar to them. 😅; Billy is looking more gross; Its bc they date dummies. Whether he tall, short, ugly or handsome, he&#39;s a dummy. And they pick them out of ease and control.; He is one Angry young Man; What is this college party train-ran, can’t get a real man, no life plan, knock off Scarlet Johannson from Temu, one hit wonder yapping about again? 😂😂😂; She look like she stank.; Ya don&#39;t be horrible,thank god I&#39;m not ugly but fat I am but wasn&#39;t in my day,but also I was a good guy,so what your saying I relate to it,❤in my day the girls liked the bad guy; Billie I&#39;ll guy...; She ain&#39;t even that beautiful; No, I was nice as fuck to her and she broke up with me because I was texting her.

I don&#39;t need a chance to think that, I already rule the world; She&#39;s has enough metal on her to rival a recycling plant.; So strange that when women make a true comment about men - men make some vile comment about her career and 41k people agreed…. And the person who posted this bitter comment comes back to thank people for his comment fame … you people are cracked; Fuck that man !  It just doesn’t make sense…. You dress up like a homeless person with autotune🥱; If a hot girl gave me the chance I should be happy and treat her like a queen; No yall talking shi I want yall to go see her concerts ❤️; Ah, yes, grown men misunderstanding what Billy Elish went through simply because they don’t understand her frustration with men but would rather mock her for fun and think that she’s just playing the victim (sigh, 🤦‍♀️ ); The same could be said for women and for the male feminists/allies who may jump in to defend her all you are doing is helping to keep the patriarchy alive and well so the joke is on you.; Haven’t we all called someone ugly or rejected someone who liked us because of their appearance.. think back to when you were young; Ugliness and beauty is subjective.. not everyone is gonna think billie is cute.. who gives a fuck?<br><br>If your not the best looking but not an asshole then your not ugly, some of the hottest guys can have the ugliest personality ever <br><br>With women we have to shave, we cannot be a certain size, we can’t wear what we want without being called a whore and most men think we are gonna cheat on them, i was asked to send nudes which I don’t do and this guy called me flat and ugly as well as a slut .. if your a guy treat women with respect, same goes for women but if y’all can’t understand each other then how you gonna find the one? Like if she trashes you then leave, if he trashes you then leave <br><br>It goes both ways not just one way.; She&#39;s not talking just about looks guys- she specifically mentioned the attitude. &quot;Ugly guys&quot; doesn&#39;t have to refer to looks. I thought she was talking about the ugly personality thing.<br>Anyway, since when did someone saying something distasteful give everyone a free pass to shame them for their looks? Y&#39;all have the ugliest attitudes 😕; Why are yall offended; And yet she cries about unfair  beauty standards; I mean she was really young at that time, sure it&#39;s a stupid thing to say but times often adjust people; Girls are humans too.<br>Thats why gymbros attract males, because girls dont really care that much about how you look.; Just for a fucking time give a nice guy a chance not the ugly or bad guy and all your freaking mess is solved; <b>cough</b> jesse rutherford <b>cough</b>; &quot;I am 14 and this is deep&quot;; Even ugly people hate on ugly people; Leave it up to a lesbian to think she knows about life 😂😂😂; Why is she looking at me like she planted c4&#39;s in my balls?; Calling people ugly is one of the ugliest behaviors.; When i get a hot girl i lap it up; Now can we imaging a guy saying the same thing people would blow up in anger; She&#39;s not pretty enough to be talking like that. lol; she&#39;s sooo pretty; Not all of them; No one is coming to Billie’s defense and it’s beautiful; Somebody called her Ugly,she fall in depression,now she is a singer,best song bad guy,instead  🎤 give her 🥒  .; Shes so real for that; Says a 6 who can barely achieve 7 with makeup; It was never abt him being attractive, it’s abt his ego.

Beauty Standards – They Make Your Life Worse,Edvasian,2022-05-05T19:47:32Z,Have you ever heard of the term pretty privilege going around on Tiktok and how beauty standards are actually kind of toxic?,QTUn8IfT6R4,"Bro my mom is Chinese and she has rounded eyes than Gigi 😭😭; Some people will still chase this mirage of making themselves tge perfect product  by altering themselves and changing their looking  but its not to feel better about themselves its to feel higher above other people and to mock them its their narcissistic supply  !; As a Chinese I’m offended-😭; Beauty works against you when you are female in STEM fields. And constant sexual harassment.  I experienced raped attempt and letf my phd program.  I lost 5 years my life depressed and started all over again. Beauty privilege only works for modeling,  acting so on otherwise it causes a lot of issues. I am not even hot pretty average. People offer free stuff hoping to get something from you back. That is why I never take presents or even coffee from men at all.; I&#39;m 40 but look like 30-35, just because of my face. I have one of those faces which doesn&#39;t age much or fast enough. No difference really. I was never aware of this until 5 years ago, and I&#39;m thankful for that. I&#39;m so sad for this generation of kids feeling they are not enough for who they are 😢😢😢😢.; that mother 💀💀💀; “Volleyball players, they eat like man” <br>Damn.; This short story takes this idea to extreme <br>Harrison Bergeron<br>Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br>Your topics are relevant and  your content enjoyable ..thank you!; But you&#39;re like really pretty.; watching Bella and GiGi&#39;s mother tell her daughter she has to give up volleyball, and then seeing how they were picking at the cake was so heartbreaking honestly.  just instilling disordered behavior into her kids from the get go; &quot;You look gorgeous&quot;<br><br>The selfie: 💀; interesting to have an ad about a skincare device in a video critiquing beauty standards..; jfc; Am I the only one who just heard a facelift can be $8000?!?! I’m blown away. That’s cheap!!!! <br>Verified online it can be as low as $7000 😮; DUDe i didn’t know you were chinese (no hate i’m chinese myself) why did i think u were korean dhsjsks; The beauty tax is an episode form a series not a movie; how about a rich people tax instead😭; YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤; Make long vids you&#39;re cute and funny!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤; Beauty standards are female culture that is blamed on men. Take some accountability females.; Speaking of plastic surgeries at young ages have you seen the doc about children getting plastic surgeries in Japan from Vice? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1vYdL7nswA"">https://youtu.be/l1vYdL7nswA?si=sVMNoaEcg7xy7qSG</a>; Beauty tax… girl the cost of being hot is sexual harassment. No need for this hypothetical shit, there’s already a downside; Movie is called 世界奇妙物语之美人税; Idk, i kinda like the idea of aging. When i see a new gray hair it makes me happy.; Coming into the middle age, I am glad I didn&#39;t have the opportunities and money to botch my face in my younger years. It isn&#39;t perfect, but I saved myself a lot of trouble. Now seeing every third woman having a trout pout, I find it ridiculous. And hanging on Instagram and all those filtered faces and meat... gosh, young people have it so hard nowadays!; the volleyball comment shocked me as most female players are actually quite athletic looking and not “big”; “Her eyes look too Chinese.” While her sister get famous because of her “foxy” eyes 😂; Heeseung looks hotter!!; Hello. You make great commentary and please ignore this if I’m wrong but i had a hard time staying because of your “top ten list mojo” voice pitch. Just in case you wanted to do this for a living, i just thought this advice could help. 😅😅 sorry for the intrusion tho. It is just my thought tho so it might not be a big issue to others. 😵‍💫🥲❤️❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹❤️❤️; Yknow whats funny, volleyball is literally what the girls would be assigned for non extreme sport for pe <br>For me, volleyball is often deemed a more feminine sport lmao<br>(Even if i know sports are gender neutral, i just think its ridiculous to call it masculine when my experience has been far from it); <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTUn8IfT6R4&amp;t=833"">13:53</a> Oh noooo! You poor thing. I find all people are beautiful/handsome. You are handsome my guy, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. SAME GOES FOR THE REST OF YALL!💜; &quot;Beauty&quot; standarts from today are not beautiful. People just look like monsters. When I think about beauty standarts, I think about paintings and sculptures of male and females from hundreds of years ago. They looked beautiful AND realistic at the same time.; Kim K is 🚮; I’ve always been bullied as a teen for being ugly and being really, really skinny and having no curves at all. I’m 32 now and what people would consider ‘’curvy’ and I get called fat by my own family. :’) it’s never good enough. Sometimes I envy good looking people that flaunt themselves but I think I just want to be pretty and accepted too. <br><br>Also Kim saying to ‘’just get up and work’ is absolutely hilarious coming from her 😅; Whoever says they&#39;d rather be ugly is lying; It’s not a movie but an episode from a tv show!  I think it was a story from Toshidensetsu — it’s kind of like a Japanese version of Black Mirror where they have short episodes of strange stories; Kim is the type of person that you wanna punch but you don’t wanna get herpes so you shouldn’t; sigh.. ok, let me say this - I would gladly pay the costs that people like Bella Hadid are paying, for an income that allowed me to offer lifelong security for my family. It&#39;s worth it for them. The ones who are paying a price without making a good gain are the young viewers who are impressionable and are just eaten alive by an industry they don&#39;t understand. But if you can make money by being beautiful and beauty is something you can get from a scalpel, then whatever, it&#39;s better than worrying about how you&#39;re going to pay for your mom&#39;s heart surgery. But not everybody can genuinely make a gain from this. It&#39;s not like you can get a higher salary as an accountant by being pretty, so pick your battles and don&#39;t let a commercial industry shape your view of yourself; Kim really put her foot in her mouth with that one. As if people who don&#39;t have as much money as her are lazy. She&#39;s a walking cliche; Beauty standards are also set by the rich - because you can only be beautiful if you have money.  Remember, &quot;beauty&quot; fades with time so you need money to maintain it.  Essentially, vanity is a form of class warfare.; Normalise aging; I just have to say you have a gorgeous skin Also I personally love the shape of your eyes; If money wasnt a factor, id get a chemical peal and some liposuction, nothing to change the basis of my face; I would really resent my Mother if she treated me that way. For a long long time; That&#39;s offensive n sad but yr reaction make it so hilarious. I know not all Chinese have jinky eyes lot us esply S W Chinese esply Vietnamese like me mixed Chinese n Vietnamese have big beautiful nice round eyes too like you n mine which are double eyelids eyes Asian way better looking.; 8k for a facelift? Where?<br><br>I’ve had two deep plane facelifts. The recovery process is no big deal. A week in partial seclusion, another three at about half your normal activities, looking a bit like you’ve been in a fight, and then you’re back to your regular life, only with the additional benefits the surgery (unfortunately) provides. <br><br>Btw, my first lift cost 14k, and the second was 18k. That last was 15 years ago, and it’s time to go,back. 8K would he an incredible bargain…but it would mean not using my regular surgeon, and that would be risky. Finding a plastic surgeon who gets great results on men is difficult.; I&#39;ve been dealing with anorexia for 1 year and im already not overweight so short of story in just 1 year my body was literally dying! But no matter how much weight i dropped whenever i search &quot; slim inspo &quot; on the internet it seems like im &quot;not skinny enough &quot;  . My bf was worried about me a lot and tried to convince me to start recovery because it just got to a point where i stopped drinking water as well because it made me feel fat . But because of this channel and because of you I&#39;m 2 days in recovery now ! I hope i make it . And im so thankful for ur content whenever i feel like starving myself to look perfect i come to ur channel.  thank you so much ❤; you had me until your sponsor; The Hadids mother infuriates me....its sad people are like that, let her eat cake woman! Its not like she couldnt have work out to compensate ....cruel woman!!!; Pretty privilege? I’m allowed to exist…; Love yr videos! Another great one! ❤; the whole would you rather be ugly or clever thing is hilarious. in one of my philosophy lectures a girl sat next to me blurted out “least i’m not stupid” and without missing a beat i accidentally shouted “least i’m not ugly” and my philosophy lecturer started laughing along with the rest of the class. i mean, she was ugly so; NEOPETS!!! ❤️ I’ve been playing since 2002. I knew I liked you!; Honestly, I&#39;m okay being a little ugly. People who only want pretty friends won&#39;t be friends with me because I don&#39;t fit their standard. That gives me more room to find friends who actually care about me. People who usually only hit on pretty girls don&#39;t hit on me. Which leaves me room to find somebody who actually loves me, not my body.  Honestly I feel like I&#39;m flying under the radar for most of this nonsense. I&#39;m just pretty enough for people to notice me but I&#39;m not pretty enough to be sought after.<br><br> I don&#39;t feel the pressure to fit in. Tbh, I&#39;m to lazy. I do the bare minimum to take care of my skin/hair. I&#39;m okay with aging. I&#39;m okay with graying.<br> I feel bad for people who spend thousands of dollars to look a certain way. I remember wanting to buy my way to &quot;beautiful&quot;. I hated my body. I&#39;m so happy I never did. It would have only made that self hate worst. <br>I also don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t want to age? If you think about it, wrinkles can be beautiful. They tell the persons story. If they had a hard life, a happy life. If they really did smile alot or have finally perfected the RBF. So much in what most people think is &quot;ugly&quot;. Everyone has a young face. Not everyone will have a mature one. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen my features, like my thick bushy eyebrows come into fashion after being told &quot;your caterpillars are going to crawl off your face&quot; for half my life so, patience might just be part of be &quot;being pretty&quot;. But if my eyebrows are in now... Haven&#39;t they always been pretty? Idk beauty standards are weird. It seems like they build off each other for a little bit. Then go to the complete opposite. <br><br>Granted, I&#39;m like a Georgia 6. Which would be a Hollywood 3. So, maybe I&#39;m just a hopeful ugly person  🤷‍♀️; Pretty privilege is just another name for lookism, except it focuses on the experiences of the &quot;pretty&quot;/privileged instead of on the &quot;ugly&quot;/unprivileged people. It is not a good alternative, IMHO.; i wish there was more notice to the hardship of being pretty <br>controversial statement on the surface, but as a woman who doesn’t like to take advantage of anyone in any way, was neglected and is pretty Asexual, <br>i have been a victim of more pedos you can count on ur hands, i can’t trust any men to value me purely as a friend and never want anything sexual from me, i constantly worry if people are only friends/with me for my appearance rather than me as a person especially was a nerd, i can’t escape the eyes of creepy men, people assume i’m stupid, people assume i’m a specific type of person<br><br>i want to be pretty ofc but i wish i couldn’t choose who found me unattractive <br><br>it’s not all sunflowers and daisies; I think I’d choose ugly because I can make people laugh and that always seems to make people see you a bit better than someone with a bad attitude but prettier face; This whole video makes me sad. Humans are forced to conform. Will we ever be free?; I love everything that is natural, that is why personally I don&#39;t like plastic surgery or anything artificial even in food. I have been a picky eater since I  was a child, but I  would never sacrifice what I love to do or eat for my looks. If anything, I have always wanted to gain wait.; I love how you start out so polite with, &quot;Good morning&quot; and then you end by saying, &quot;Don&#39;t be dumb.&quot;  😅; &quot;I was the brunette&quot; what; I rather enjoy cakes and everything nice ❤ I would rather use the money for food 😂; so you are extrem pretty and super sweet and you talk about beauty standards ?🤔; 💚💃🏼; @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTUn8IfT6R4&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> LMAO!!; Reminds me of a guy and his family got denied a Japan tourist visa for being ugly 😅; I love his sarcastic dry humor lol; As long as humans can dream about being better, beauty will exist as well as cultural standards; Boo; I am not conventionally attractive and If someone offered me to magically become more &quot;attractive&quot; I would decline it. I grew up comparing myself to other girls, whishing to have their noses, legs, boobs, knees, hair, hating my appearance. Sometimes other kids made fun of my features. I don&#39;t get as much attention as my more attractive friends get. Still all these things have shaped my personality and how I see the world. I am learning to love myself and I think I made good progress. Giving up my appearance feels like giving up myself as a person. So if beautiful means &quot;conventionally attractive&quot; and ugly means being myself, the answer to the question is obviously being ugly; I couldn’t focus after hearing gigi hadid say “homeboy” so many times; I think advertising beauty devices in a video like this is somewhat in a bad taste; Looks like a great movie. Gotta watch this; I dono. I loath that no matter where i go people want to talk to me/start sh!t with me. <br>Like leave me alone. Im just trying to buy some food; Ggggggggg; I can&#39;t just feel compassion for super models who agreed to have plastic surgery, are millionaires and complain about their perfect life on social media.; Idk if anyone has commented this yet but I wanna say how much I appreciate the twilight princess sound bites in the background. They take me back and make me nostalgic for my favorite game; Introduce beauty tax and watch the people get plastic surgery to look ugly.; Tbf kardashians ain&#39;t that pretty.; Well... i still prefer crying in my Ferrari than a third hand broken down car, sooooo; i love how the kardashians act like surgery is so terrifying and they&#39;ve never had any before LOL; this guy actually looks like he&#39;d like something invasive to him; Yolanda must be a nightmare for a mother. I felt bad for her girls when Jimmy Fallon had to sneak them some actually fun food; I think it&#39;s very sexist because they are only targeting women and not men in the show. I think it should of been fair if they are doing it tax men as much as women.; Totally in love with the movie and mystery recaps; Anyone think it&#39;s weird that he&#39;s criticising beauty standards while shilling for sponsors that uphold the beauty standards?; Just feeding the YouTube Algorithm.<br>Don&#39;t mind me!; If we as a society want to put value on a pretty face, that feels quite natural. Even some animals like a pretty face more than one with less pleasing bone structure. But beauty is like vapor. We will all get old, and some of us may suffer an injury or disease that totally messes up our face or body. It’s fine to value your own looks, but it’s healthier to remember just how little it adds to your quality of character, or skills, or any part of your life that brings true fulfillment and pleasure (and still brings that public acceptance)<br><br>If you wanna make money off your looks? Best of luck. That is a journey filled with the most soul destroying critical insecurities one can imagine. Your entire worth becomes wrapped up in your looks, and that can be one heck of a psychological bind.; I wanted to be Beautiful like my Mom and my two older Sisters. I was so skinny my Son saw a picture of me as a kid and said my arms looked like little chicken wingettes🙄🙄🙄. I have the worst chapped lips ever, try having chapped lips as a kid. My lips cracked split and bled all of the time, Mom bought me all types of chapstick and lip balm and nothing worked. A boy in my 4th grade class called me &quot;Dessert Lips&quot; one day when he came to my house looking for me, I laughed and I still laugh about it, plus he was cute. You have to roll with life😁😁😁; &quot;watching them eat cake like that is making me burn calories coz of how confused I am&quot; Edvasian 2022; Yolanda Hadid is so toxic.  Those young women need to go NC with her, as she&#39;s horrible.; So you&#39;re Chinese thank god; Beauty (I mean meeting beauty standards) isn&#39;t something you&#39;re born with. It is payed for. Daily. With your money, time, sometimes health, effort, even your dreams. To the point where you should think a hundred times if it&#39;s really worth it. And adding a tax to all this would be the final shot; Okay but pretty privilege is bs ppl will treat you different but better? Idk about that, I kinda miss when men would ignore me. At my most conveniently attractive men were extremely creepy- more than normal- &amp; women were kinda meaner because their S/O would treat me like some e-girl. “Beauty is a double edged sword” like yeah I get free stuff &amp; I’ve never been turned down for a job after they’ve seen me. But it’s really a give and take because I’ve been through some extremely traumatic because of being pretty; Nothing like an empowering beauty standards video being sponsored by ageism.; Well, Nicole Kidman is one of the worst. I watched Aquaman and was literary shocked to see her playing the role of a young woman - with that stupid, botoxed face! Why not give the role to an actually young woman was behind me.; If anyone is still looking for the movie it’s actually from a show “世にも奇妙な物語” (“yo nimo kimyou na monogatari”) 2016 Spring Special; Found another comfort YouTuber who rarely posts; <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>; Lmao the way they portray &quot;ugly&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTUn8IfT6R4&amp;t=36"">0:36</a>... Not only is it tacky af, but the characteristics they try to protray as &quot;ugly&quot; are just not. I feel pity for whoever sees the world that way. <br><br>Honestly people who care so much about beauty standards are pathetic, and I&#39;m tired of pretending they&#39;re not. We&#39;re really supposed to treat &quot;beauty&quot; as a respectable hobby, job or occupation? Just because it&#39;s one of women&#39;s occupations that has been historically discredited, just because it was a women&#39;s job and women weren&#39;t taken seriously, doesn&#39;t mean it deserves a rehabilitation. It&#39;s on the same level as bs office jobs that have no real use or meaning, and the sole purpose of the whole beauty industry (including ALL beauty influencers) is to perpetuate an illusion based on artificial criterea. It&#39;s time to overthrow it, I&#39;m not even kidding.","Beauty Standards – They Make Your Life Worse Have you ever heard of the term pretty privilege going around on Tiktok and how beauty standards are actually kind of toxic? Bro my mom is Chinese and she has rounded eyes than Gigi 😭😭; Some people will still chase this mirage of making themselves tge perfect product  by altering themselves and changing their looking  but its not to feel better about themselves its to feel higher above other people and to mock them its their narcissistic supply  !; As a Chinese I’m offended-😭; Beauty works against you when you are female in STEM fields. And constant sexual harassment.  I experienced raped attempt and letf my phd program.  I lost 5 years my life depressed and started all over again. Beauty privilege only works for modeling,  acting so on otherwise it causes a lot of issues. I am not even hot pretty average. People offer free stuff hoping to get something from you back. That is why I never take presents or even coffee from men at all.; I&#39;m 40 but look like 30-35, just because of my face. I have one of those faces which doesn&#39;t age much or fast enough. No difference really. I was never aware of this until 5 years ago, and I&#39;m thankful for that. I&#39;m so sad for this generation of kids feeling they are not enough for who they are 😢😢😢😢.; that mother 💀💀💀; “Volleyball players, they eat like man” <br>Damn.; This short story takes this idea to extreme <br>Harrison Bergeron<br>Kurt Vonnegut Jr.<br>Your topics are relevant and  your content enjoyable ..thank you!; But you&#39;re like really pretty.; watching Bella and GiGi&#39;s mother tell her daughter she has to give up volleyball, and then seeing how they were picking at the cake was so heartbreaking honestly.  just instilling disordered behavior into her kids from the get go; &quot;You look gorgeous&quot;<br><br>The selfie: 💀; interesting to have an ad about a skincare device in a video critiquing beauty standards..; jfc; Am I the only one who just heard a facelift can be $8000?!?! I’m blown away. That’s cheap!!!! <br>Verified online it can be as low as $7000 😮; DUDe i didn’t know you were chinese (no hate i’m chinese myself) why did i think u were korean dhsjsks; The beauty tax is an episode form a series not a movie; how about a rich people tax instead😭; YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤; Make long vids you&#39;re cute and funny!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤; Beauty standards are female culture that is blamed on men. Take some accountability females.; Speaking of plastic surgeries at young ages have you seen the doc about children getting plastic surgeries in Japan from Vice? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1vYdL7nswA"">https://youtu.be/l1vYdL7nswA?si=sVMNoaEcg7xy7qSG</a>; Beauty tax… girl the cost of being hot is sexual harassment. No need for this hypothetical shit, there’s already a downside; Movie is called 世界奇妙物语之美人税; Idk, i kinda like the idea of aging. When i see a new gray hair it makes me happy.; Coming into the middle age, I am glad I didn&#39;t have the opportunities and money to botch my face in my younger years. It isn&#39;t perfect, but I saved myself a lot of trouble. Now seeing every third woman having a trout pout, I find it ridiculous. And hanging on Instagram and all those filtered faces and meat... gosh, young people have it so hard nowadays!; the volleyball comment shocked me as most female players are actually quite athletic looking and not “big”; “Her eyes look too Chinese.” While her sister get famous because of her “foxy” eyes 😂; Heeseung looks hotter!!; Hello. You make great commentary and please ignore this if I’m wrong but i had a hard time staying because of your “top ten list mojo” voice pitch. Just in case you wanted to do this for a living, i just thought this advice could help. 😅😅 sorry for the intrusion tho. It is just my thought tho so it might not be a big issue to others. 😵‍💫🥲❤️❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹❤️❤️; Yknow whats funny, volleyball is literally what the girls would be assigned for non extreme sport for pe <br>For me, volleyball is often deemed a more feminine sport lmao<br>(Even if i know sports are gender neutral, i just think its ridiculous to call it masculine when my experience has been far from it); <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTUn8IfT6R4&amp;t=833"">13:53</a> Oh noooo! You poor thing. I find all people are beautiful/handsome. You are handsome my guy, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. SAME GOES FOR THE REST OF YALL!💜; &quot;Beauty&quot; standarts from today are not beautiful. People just look like monsters. When I think about beauty standarts, I think about paintings and sculptures of male and females from hundreds of years ago. They looked beautiful AND realistic at the same time.; Kim K is 🚮; I’ve always been bullied as a teen for being ugly and being really, really skinny and having no curves at all. I’m 32 now and what people would consider ‘’curvy’ and I get called fat by my own family. :’) it’s never good enough. Sometimes I envy good looking people that flaunt themselves but I think I just want to be pretty and accepted too. <br><br>Also Kim saying to ‘’just get up and work’ is absolutely hilarious coming from her 😅; Whoever says they&#39;d rather be ugly is lying; It’s not a movie but an episode from a tv show!  I think it was a story from Toshidensetsu — it’s kind of like a Japanese version of Black Mirror where they have short episodes of strange stories; Kim is the type of person that you wanna punch but you don’t wanna get herpes so you shouldn’t; sigh.. ok, let me say this - I would gladly pay the costs that people like Bella Hadid are paying, for an income that allowed me to offer lifelong security for my family. It&#39;s worth it for them. The ones who are paying a price without making a good gain are the young viewers who are impressionable and are just eaten alive by an industry they don&#39;t understand. But if you can make money by being beautiful and beauty is something you can get from a scalpel, then whatever, it&#39;s better than worrying about how you&#39;re going to pay for your mom&#39;s heart surgery. But not everybody can genuinely make a gain from this. It&#39;s not like you can get a higher salary as an accountant by being pretty, so pick your battles and don&#39;t let a commercial industry shape your view of yourself; Kim really put her foot in her mouth with that one. As if people who don&#39;t have as much money as her are lazy. She&#39;s a walking cliche; Beauty standards are also set by the rich - because you can only be beautiful if you have money.  Remember, &quot;beauty&quot; fades with time so you need money to maintain it.  Essentially, vanity is a form of class warfare.; Normalise aging; I just have to say you have a gorgeous skin Also I personally love the shape of your eyes; If money wasnt a factor, id get a chemical peal and some liposuction, nothing to change the basis of my face; I would really resent my Mother if she treated me that way. For a long long time; That&#39;s offensive n sad but yr reaction make it so hilarious. I know not all Chinese have jinky eyes lot us esply S W Chinese esply Vietnamese like me mixed Chinese n Vietnamese have big beautiful nice round eyes too like you n mine which are double eyelids eyes Asian way better looking.; 8k for a facelift? Where?<br><br>I’ve had two deep plane facelifts. The recovery process is no big deal. A week in partial seclusion, another three at about half your normal activities, looking a bit like you’ve been in a fight, and then you’re back to your regular life, only with the additional benefits the surgery (unfortunately) provides. <br><br>Btw, my first lift cost 14k, and the second was 18k. That last was 15 years ago, and it’s time to go,back. 8K would he an incredible bargain…but it would mean not using my regular surgeon, and that would be risky. Finding a plastic surgeon who gets great results on men is difficult.; I&#39;ve been dealing with anorexia for 1 year and im already not overweight so short of story in just 1 year my body was literally dying! But no matter how much weight i dropped whenever i search &quot; slim inspo &quot; on the internet it seems like im &quot;not skinny enough &quot;  . My bf was worried about me a lot and tried to convince me to start recovery because it just got to a point where i stopped drinking water as well because it made me feel fat . But because of this channel and because of you I&#39;m 2 days in recovery now ! I hope i make it . And im so thankful for ur content whenever i feel like starving myself to look perfect i come to ur channel.  thank you so much ❤; you had me until your sponsor; The Hadids mother infuriates me....its sad people are like that, let her eat cake woman! Its not like she couldnt have work out to compensate ....cruel woman!!!; Pretty privilege? I’m allowed to exist…; Love yr videos! Another great one! ❤; the whole would you rather be ugly or clever thing is hilarious. in one of my philosophy lectures a girl sat next to me blurted out “least i’m not stupid” and without missing a beat i accidentally shouted “least i’m not ugly” and my philosophy lecturer started laughing along with the rest of the class. i mean, she was ugly so; NEOPETS!!! ❤️ I’ve been playing since 2002. I knew I liked you!; Honestly, I&#39;m okay being a little ugly. People who only want pretty friends won&#39;t be friends with me because I don&#39;t fit their standard. That gives me more room to find friends who actually care about me. People who usually only hit on pretty girls don&#39;t hit on me. Which leaves me room to find somebody who actually loves me, not my body.  Honestly I feel like I&#39;m flying under the radar for most of this nonsense. I&#39;m just pretty enough for people to notice me but I&#39;m not pretty enough to be sought after.<br><br> I don&#39;t feel the pressure to fit in. Tbh, I&#39;m to lazy. I do the bare minimum to take care of my skin/hair. I&#39;m okay with aging. I&#39;m okay with graying.<br> I feel bad for people who spend thousands of dollars to look a certain way. I remember wanting to buy my way to &quot;beautiful&quot;. I hated my body. I&#39;m so happy I never did. It would have only made that self hate worst. <br>I also don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t want to age? If you think about it, wrinkles can be beautiful. They tell the persons story. If they had a hard life, a happy life. If they really did smile alot or have finally perfected the RBF. So much in what most people think is &quot;ugly&quot;. Everyone has a young face. Not everyone will have a mature one. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen my features, like my thick bushy eyebrows come into fashion after being told &quot;your caterpillars are going to crawl off your face&quot; for half my life so, patience might just be part of be &quot;being pretty&quot;. But if my eyebrows are in now... Haven&#39;t they always been pretty? Idk beauty standards are weird. It seems like they build off each other for a little bit. Then go to the complete opposite. <br><br>Granted, I&#39;m like a Georgia 6. Which would be a Hollywood 3. So, maybe I&#39;m just a hopeful ugly person  🤷‍♀️; Pretty privilege is just another name for lookism, except it focuses on the experiences of the &quot;pretty&quot;/privileged instead of on the &quot;ugly&quot;/unprivileged people. It is not a good alternative, IMHO.; i wish there was more notice to the hardship of being pretty <br>controversial statement on the surface, but as a woman who doesn’t like to take advantage of anyone in any way, was neglected and is pretty Asexual, <br>i have been a victim of more pedos you can count on ur hands, i can’t trust any men to value me purely as a friend and never want anything sexual from me, i constantly worry if people are only friends/with me for my appearance rather than me as a person especially was a nerd, i can’t escape the eyes of creepy men, people assume i’m stupid, people assume i’m a specific type of person<br><br>i want to be pretty ofc but i wish i couldn’t choose who found me unattractive <br><br>it’s not all sunflowers and daisies; I think I’d choose ugly because I can make people laugh and that always seems to make people see you a bit better than someone with a bad attitude but prettier face; This whole video makes me sad. Humans are forced to conform. Will we ever be free?; I love everything that is natural, that is why personally I don&#39;t like plastic surgery or anything artificial even in food. I have been a picky eater since I  was a child, but I  would never sacrifice what I love to do or eat for my looks. If anything, I have always wanted to gain wait.; I love how you start out so polite with, &quot;Good morning&quot; and then you end by saying, &quot;Don&#39;t be dumb.&quot;  😅; &quot;I was the brunette&quot; what; I rather enjoy cakes and everything nice ❤ I would rather use the money for food 😂; so you are extrem pretty and super sweet and you talk about beauty standards ?🤔; 💚💃🏼; @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTUn8IfT6R4&amp;t=761"">12:41</a> LMAO!!; Reminds me of a guy and his family got denied a Japan tourist visa for being ugly 😅; I love his sarcastic dry humor lol; As long as humans can dream about being better, beauty will exist as well as cultural standards; Boo; I am not conventionally attractive and If someone offered me to magically become more &quot;attractive&quot; I would decline it. I grew up comparing myself to other girls, whishing to have their noses, legs, boobs, knees, hair, hating my appearance. Sometimes other kids made fun of my features. I don&#39;t get as much attention as my more attractive friends get. Still all these things have shaped my personality and how I see the world. I am learning to love myself and I think I made good progress. Giving up my appearance feels like giving up myself as a person. So if beautiful means &quot;conventionally attractive&quot; and ugly means being myself, the answer to the question is obviously being ugly; I couldn’t focus after hearing gigi hadid say “homeboy” so many times; I think advertising beauty devices in a video like this is somewhat in a bad taste; Looks like a great movie. Gotta watch this; I dono. I loath that no matter where i go people want to talk to me/start sh!t with me. <br>Like leave me alone. Im just trying to buy some food; Ggggggggg; I can&#39;t just feel compassion for super models who agreed to have plastic surgery, are millionaires and complain about their perfect life on social media.; Idk if anyone has commented this yet but I wanna say how much I appreciate the twilight princess sound bites in the background.

Now men are basically expected by society &quot;unwritten&quot; to be subordinate to self righteous women who wont hesitate to weaponize the police to avoid losing a battle of opinions and entitlement. Now with the media transparency, we can all see the bigger picture and dynamics. If I can say anything to get under the &quot;skin&quot; of these evolutionary solidified lost causes of society, i will as a singhle hopeless romantic with no inclination into accepting this reality. Men that are treated by society as second class citizens and expected to desire a undesirable relationship and be subservient by socieital expectation has ended by the self righteousness is still alive. What is wrong with men? Jerking off and being alone seems like the most attractive outcome. Evolution is happening and no one notices.

Get off your highhorse and learn how to respect others or dont let the Darwinism door hit ya. imagine having to lower your self esteem and working hard to impress someone who will bounce once your not their best option.  Narcissism is the only unchecked disorder and they diagnosing everryone else. This obviously is a generalization and dosnt apply to everyone but its a huge problem that is never brought up since &quot;women are always right&quot;. So i guess bulletproof backpacks for homecomings should be manditory since money and womens egos matter more than children. E veryone fears the backlash from standing up to these people and it really fing shows.  I am not getting any so the weaponization of P*<b>*</b> in relationships has no effect on me and as more people are affected this will only grow. Men are not doing bad, our society is. Without a princess to chase, we would rather f off. Every married man i ever met said if i wasnt married i would do this or that. This or that or enjoyable relationship. Women get mad at guys for watching porn and see no fault of their own. No satisfied guy watchs porn ever in history. Im not sorry. you (who ever it applies to) should be. Just ask this, would you date you knowing what you know? Just a thought, not trying to belittle or rant. This is a dynamic that is part of our culture and &quot;women always being right&quot; should yeild amazing results since they are right. Its not your looks &quot; its everything else&quot; ps im not andrew tate and i dont symposize with him in any way or listen to take his philosopy as gospel before im accused of that. Heavenly Father has my back. I will have my time to shine but it is not now obviously; For the longest time once I hit my 30&#39;s I started to struggle with the idea that I was getting older. I can&#39;t imagine how intense the pressure is for women, but I do know it does creep in for us men too. Luckily as I got into my mid 30&#39;s I came to terms with getting older, and just decided to focus on keeping myself well kempt and going to the gym and eating healthy. I hate that people of all genders are pressured to look a certain way at the detriment to their health. Thanks for covering this, I think a lot more folks need to realize they are physically okay the way they are and if they aren&#39;t, focusing on increasing things like health and style are much better alternatives than trying to make themselves look like someone else.; because the only thing that matters is looks; guys are having surgery to get taller. the cut your femur and use bolt to push them apart. the body acts like if the bone is broken and builds new bone in the gap making a guy taller. <br>their is also guys who literally hit there jaws with hammers to get a &quot;better jaw&quot;.

Also height, Ive seen some guys pad their shoes so they can be taller and they can&#39;t even walk right, hurting their knees and toes. It&#39;s an issue no one talks about.

You see this a lot in the gay world as well.; hooded eyes vs double eye lid ?   which is better?   I don&#39;t get it.

Try standing up for your self in America for equal consideration and you become a misogynist  oppressor in their eyes and they will sabatoge everything then respect the rights and feelings of others. if i cant walk all over you and disreguard all your feelings and expect everyone to kneel before them.  The foriegn tourist industry has spoken. Enjoy water country! Yes men in this world are abusive and you chose them over autistic people who are lining up in suicide call center lines. 988 number released on a saturday and call center all women. We are not your slaves! if people want p*<b>*</b> they cant fly to Amsterdam(100flights per hour). no one will chase a loveless manipulative monster anymore. Get off your highhorse and learn how to respect others or dont let the Darwinism door hit ya. imagine having to lower your self esteem and working hard to impress someone who will bounce once your not their best option.  Narcissism is the only unchecked disorder and they diagnosing everryone else. This obviously is a generalization and dosnt apply to everyone but its a huge problem that is never brought up since &quot;women are always right&quot;. So i guess bulletproof backpacks for homecomings should be manditory since money and womens egos matter more than children. E veryone fears the backlash from standing up to these people and it really fing shows.  I am not getting any so the weaponization of P*<b>*</b> in relationships has no effect on me and as more people are affected this will only grow. Men are not doing bad, our society is. Without a princess to chase, we would rather f off. Every married man i ever met said if i wasnt married i would do this or that. This or that or enjoyable relationship. Women get mad at guys for watching porn and see no fault of their own. No satisfied guy watchs porn ever in history. Im not sorry. you (who ever it applies to) should be. Just ask this, would you date you knowing what you know? Just a thought, not trying to belittle or rant. This is a dynamic that is part of our culture and &quot;women always being right&quot; should yeild amazing results since they are right. Its not your looks &quot; its everything else&quot; ps im not andrew tate and i dont symposize with him in any way or listen to take his philosopy as gospel before im accused of that. Heavenly Father has my back. I will have my time to shine but it is not now obviously; For the longest time once I hit my 30&#39;s I started to struggle with the idea that I was getting older. I can&#39;t imagine how intense the pressure is for women, but I do know it does creep in for us men too. Luckily as I got into my mid 30&#39;s I came to terms with getting older, and just decided to focus on keeping myself well kempt and going to the gym and eating healthy. I hate that people of all genders are pressured to look a certain way at the detriment to their health. Thanks for covering this, I think a lot more folks need to realize they are physically okay the way they are and if they aren&#39;t, focusing on increasing things like health and style are much better alternatives than trying to make themselves look like someone else.; because the only thing that matters is looks; guys are having surgery to get taller. the cut your femur and use bolt to push them apart. the body acts like if the bone is broken and builds new bone in the gap making a guy taller. <br>their is also guys who literally hit there jaws with hammers to get a &quot;better jaw&quot;.

Today it is a HUGE trend and expectation to be fit. Not just lean but fit. Arms have to be bulging, shoulders need to be as wide as possible and abs... Also height, Ive seen some guys pad their shoes so they can be taller and they can&#39;t even walk right, hurting their knees and toes. It&#39;s an issue no one talks about. If you look at men from other eras, most were just thin and a few were strong but it wasn&#39;t expected for you to be like the Rock. You see this a lot in the gay world as well.; hooded eyes vs double eye lid ?   which is better?   I don&#39;t get it.

BEAUTY STANDARDS AROUND THE WORLD... PROBLEMATIC?,Stephanie Lange,2021-04-29T18:58:15Z,"We tend to think it's just us that have to deal with the unrealistic, sometimes toxic beauty standards - but in fact women ...",UXSU_Lvq2WY,"I still don’t understand how or why that one person commented on your older videos that you’re a butter face…. Like. You’re breathtaking. 🤍; As I&#39;ve got older, I find the imperfect of people is much more beautiful. A person who believes themselves gorgeous and needs to be the pretty one in every crowd, automatically becomes unattractive. <br>I&#39;m not the communal beautiful but aware that my heart shines making me noticed more but I truly believe it is God shinning through ❤; Honestly as an asian person.....I think China and Taiwan both have unrealistic beauty standards. All their actresses had plastic surgery and look like aliens with big eyes and narrow face and small lips. It makes me miss the 1980s and 1990s chinese/taiwanese actresses where they were naturally beautiful.; Again, i have no clue if you get these comments BUT i am so upset i missed this collection 😢😢 alice is my FAVORITE ❤❤❤❤  all time story! I like to collect alice pieces when they make sense for me AND THIS CERTAINLY DOES!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IOFlH_2tfY"">https://youtu.be/_IOFlH_2tfY?si=fA2ZIoHrUg9RkRrR</a>; The eyeshadow does look amazing but isnt british history museum controversial?; You do makeup like a professional. Also, it&#39;s interesting seing the difference in beauty standards worldwide. This proves that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder.; That is a LOT of advertisement - and very little content; So, I have Type 2 Oculocutaneous Albinism, there are different types of Albinism depending on how much melanin loss you have and which body parts are impacted by it. I&#39;ve got moderate loss on a scale of mild/moderate/severe, so when I was first born my hair was pure white, then turned a bit bleached looking platinum blonde as I got a little older showing I had tiny amount of melanin, but not much. My skin is mostly impacted, it&#39;s just super pale vampire like and I wear Jergens Natural Glow gradual tanning lotion just to fit in the &quot;fair or ivory&quot; foundation shades, my eyes have vision issues and are clear blue like fiji water/gray that turn red in photographs very badly. My family besides me and my brother have jet black hair, tanned olive skin, and brown eyes. It&#39;s interesting because in America you hear of &quot;white privilege&quot; and for me, I have had to dye my hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes since elementary school due to chronic bullying, and then starting in high school/college due did the same due to looking so &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;alien like&quot; I hear a lot, so I wouldn&#39;t miss out on  countless job opportunities, problems dating, lose out on getting loans for things, apartment approvals, etc. I have the exact opposite problem you hear so much about. It is surreal that my natural state in a lot of countries is considered &quot;special&quot; or &quot;strived for&quot;, when I have tried so hard to have to hide this my whole life and waste money I shouldn&#39;t need to due to cruel beauty and appearance expectations. Ready for natural beauty acceptance that&#39;s for sure!; Ich Jörg lange werde unerlaubt cam ins Internet gestellt uhrheberrechts Verletzung sofort Polizei melden Seiten zeigen; Universal beauty, throughout the centuries, seems to be whatever the wealthy can afford to look like.<br>Then everyone else just copies.; Can someone tell me why Steph  puts dark shadow or any shadow on her dark circles (her under eyes?) I don’t understand; I think a lot of it has to do with wanting the opposite of what you are or have....if you have curly hair, you want straight. If you have straight hair you want curly hair. If you have dark skin, you want light skin and if you have pale skin you want darker skin. Same with eye color, body shape, hair color etc....we always seem to want something we don&#39;t have.....; Why do they alway describe African women as poor like there’s so much more to African beauty standards! 😢; This highlights the privilege and entitlement that some white women have, as they feel entitled to a certain standard of beauty and are not willing to adapt to changing norms. On the other hand, women of color have had to navigate a beauty industry that has historically excluded them, leading them to be more resourceful and creative in their approach to beauty.; Current uk beauty standards are horrendous, I just do my thing and avoid looking like the clone army; It’s a bit strange how most beauty standard are about looking like a child, and that’s not only for facial standards as well; I wish you covered different art and political history in various countries you’re interested it; I LOOOOOOOOVE your eye makeup!!! I am a guy who is artistic, and well I&#39;ve never been into makeup, but your makeup makes me want to try, lol!; I never liked the big hips big booty tanned skin look for myself. I like the petite, pale me, also my teeth are super crooked and perfectly fine that way👏; I’m Japanese and I would say the vampire teeth was popular about 10 years ago because a popular singer had it. But now she is not that influential as she used to be and people just want straight teeth like American.; Society: praise pale fair skin<br>Also society: bully people with pale fair skin; I never had issues with mine and I live in west Asia 👁👁 probably because I don’t know the beauty standards here..the only thing I would say that made me have the issue is the hair style ..it was straight hair and my natural hair is curly; I have the &quot;crooked&quot; teeth (naturally) but i soon have to wear braces because it caused TMJ (a condition where my jaw cracks every time i open it); I&#39;m glad to live in scandinavia where the ancient beauty standard was to have white skin/be white, have blue eyes and blonde hair and now it&#39;s more about looking healthy and like you&#39;re taking care of yourself. Not saying that our beauty standards are the best but it&#39;s more chill than some other countries&#39; beauty standards.; Ahaha for Chinese part, I totally agree that they prefer white skinned.<br><br>I moved to Brisbane many years ago and some years ago, when I went back n visited my family, they said I was as tanned as farmers😂; Honestly this fair skin, long black hair *thick hairs to be precise*, medium thick body and medium height beauty standard of India is so damaging. I&#39;m a tanned tall girl of my fam who is more thick considered to my other relatives, I&#39;m so insecure all the time. I might not even know that sometimes i go about degrading myself for my skin or height which is very normal since my great grandfather was dark and my father is 6ft.; No African Countries......; Japanese women are so obsessed with keeping their skin white, it’s sad… and ridiculous lol If you visit Japan in the summer, you’ll see many women holding a sun umbrella and wearing arm covers in the dead of heat🥵 I like to get tanned, but it makes it very difficult to buy foundation that match my skin tone - there are very few options. People are completely obsessed with not getting freckles, wrinkles, and just aging in general…The “yaeba” teeth trend might have faded out in the past decade or so though :) Anyhow your makeup looks gorgeous!!💓; Lets be real, for most part of europe also austrelia lets say USA too, the standart is to be white, blonde hair and blue eyes; Not trying to be disrespectful at all. However, in Japan it seems like a very pre-pubescent lock is what they are attracted to. Very light childlike looking skin, teeth that are still crooked and growing in. I would honestly be concerned with the amount of pedophilia that it appears to be happening.; Lotus foot use to be a old traditional  trend in china . It was desired. Even more if you want to be married.; No matter where we live in the world, why don&#39;t we just love ourselves for how we are?; Poeple are just crazy…stopping melanin production is dangerous 😩😩😩😩😩🫣🫣🫣good research and good video❤️❤️; They will allways make you desire what you don&#39;t have and your mindset turn into &quot;if I buy this product I will have this and that&quot; making you feel shamed for not having It  😞; Question Ms. Stephanie: when would you wear your make up like that. I always thought that was runway make-up.; I can’t actually wear eye shadow due to an eye issue but these palettes are igniting something deep within me I might have to buy anyway 😂 😍they are so beautiful; When it comes to past, pale skin was considered desirable even in Europe due to showing that you were staying outside and you were not working under the sun<br>Now, it&#39;s all from colonisation; I reeeeallly want to know if the twerk icon and influencer: @Nastya_Nass_ has cellulite? Because her body and butt always looks flawless😳 Even after she gave birth to her baby.. I think that’s impossible😅 So really want to know!; everythings is from zesse jajaj; jsut saying not trying to be rude but you can’t use England and UK interchangeably bc they’re different things; As an Indian girl, I don&#39;t fit the beauty standard of Indian Women, it&#39;s more in the West. Yet I&#39;m still considered ugly in both countries.; hi ! i grew up in 6 countries around the world. i was so surprised when i found out that people in each country thought their beauty standards were THE beauty standards hahahah; Very well described ♥️; As a Japanese girl that was born and raised in California, I tanned a lot. And when I was young, it didn’t bother me much. But as I started to get into my teenage years, I became more and more insecure about my tan skin. Knowing that I look nothing like the american models on magazines and on instagram, I turned to Japanese models and magazines. Because that’s where I look more like. The thing is, I never once saw a tan japanese model to look up to. At least one who was naturally tan like me. So I hated my skin so much. I wanted to be light skinned. I’ve never once understood back then why American instagram models who had naturally light skin wanted to be tan.; This is one of your worst videos; I think the snaggletooth thing is supposed to make you look like a little girl. Kind of creepy.; Interesting that Japanese likes the crooked teeth with protruding fang... I have slightly crooked teeth with a slightly protruding fang lol. My husband actually likes it too.; So basically the Japanese wanna look like a vampire... Pale, and canine these showing.; I always love ur videos BTW I love zeesea and they now have a nude in the dragon lipstick; The beauty standards in India regarding fair skin are rooted in its colonial past, agreed... But big eyes and long hair have been prevalent way before that.... The beautiful men and women were described to have big eyes,long hair, straight nose,big broad forehead.... Long hair in fact symbolizes strength and kings in the olden days used to wear their hair long... But one thing I have noticed is that there is not much emphasis on beauty in India as there is in the west... Over here the fields and topics related to academics are really toxic... But that&#39;s a whole other story; A pretty girl is a pretty girl; Where I&#39;m from (Ghana in West Africa) , some guys would prefer more full-looking girls, but the slim thick seems to be more preferred, which is honestly not possibe. It&#39;s sad when guys say they want natural girls, yet show pictures of influencers on Instagram and I&#39;m like 😑; Japan loves snaggle teeth but worships being super thin.....their standards are as backwards as ours lol; Shout out to every desi brown girl in Asia ❤️<br>You all are beautiful...; We always want what we don&#39;t have or hard to achieve...; Omg that brand is sooo expensive .. and you got them all for free🤩🤩 you  are soo lucky 🥺🥺; It&#39;s so hard to find africain FACES beauty standard. How should their faces look like to be considered beautiful ?; I love your makeup! It looks sooo good on you!; Japanese dental beauty standards are damn scary. God people all over the world have issues when it comes to their “ understanding of beauty”; So what I learnt from this video is that your are already perfect 💗 it just some  people can&#39;t see it; can&#39;t really say the look you named as popular in west is &quot;the look&quot; in scandinavia. here it&#39;s more natural looking features that&#39;s the shit.; Thank you for doing proper justice in explaining the beauty standards and the why of it all. It drives me crazy when someone thinks Asians want to be white to look more Caucasian. No actually, please don’t speak of a culture and their norms if you have no idea!! You were so well spoken and knowledgeable!!! &lt;3; I hate ur look on beauty standards; It is about looking white or more white in those other countries. Why would anyone think someone in Tokyo is a peasant lol; I&#39;m an Indian and we mostly are brown people who got fair skin dreams from Invaders ( Mughals and Britishers mainly) but today We believe in &quot; Brown and beautiful&quot; to abolish products like &quot; Fair&amp; Lovely&quot;. In fact the brand changed name from &quot; Fair &amp;  Lovely &quot; to &quot; Glow &amp; Lovely&quot; now. <br>    Yes we are Asians but we don&#39;t run behind White skin, perfect body and Fake beauty standards .; in the UK braces and most healthcare is free (apart from private); I&#39;m aware that you were just generalizing africa, but from where I come from South Africa, we struggle with colourism.. The light in complexion women are more desirable.

Real teeth are crooked and real teeth are not super white. One of my girls has a small gorgeous gap between her two front teeth. I always told her growing up that one day a man is gonna fall in love with her bc of the gap between her teeth. She is 19 now and has grown to love her gap and she is always told by others that they love it too!; That was weird how you only spoke on African beauty standards for 5 seconds of the video; Imo every country has their own beauty, it sucks that people seek after a beauty standard.,; i wish there&#39;s more about the actual topic instead of the make up tho. not hating, just my opinion because i want to hear more 😁; In India, people considers round eyes.; It’s crazy to me that so many things change around the world, no wonder human geography is so complicated.; eu nem entendo inglês,mas adoro esse canal; wow in England im teased for being pale, but in China, I&#39;m shamed for looking yellow and tanned.  and I&#39;m also told by my parents that I&#39;m not perfect because of my freckles.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SO I DID NOTHING AND CONTINUE TO LIVE MY LIFE KNOWING AM A MOTHERFECKING CATCH.

The Youngest Plastic Surgery Influencer at 16,Edvasian,2022-09-21T02:31:07Z,this story is wild » socials » Instagram/Twitter/Tiktok @edvasian Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/edvazian Discord ...,s-If1dP3Plc,"ihate that anyone feels the need to come to such drastic methods, but honestly,  if she&#39;s happy,  i think that&#39;s more important. it is a problem,  but i can&#39;t blame her; I grew up in China, I feel like to share some of my stories regarding to beauty growing up. I didn&#39;t grow up with parents, and was also one year younger than all my classmates. so I would say I mature one or two years later compare to other classmates. In junior high, when all I cared abt were movies, novels, anime and drawings I got my first criticism on my appearance, that was the first time I had an idea that people care abt what others look like. I didn&#39;t understand and simply because I had too many hobbies at the time, I had no effort to even think abt my face.  Soon I noticed, I would get dragged into conversation abt makeups, dressing styles and Korean idols and shit like that, and I had no interest at all which doesn&#39;t affect that my girl/bitch classmates come to me and criticize abt my eye lid, my nose, my check bone, my skin color(i was pale), which wasn&#39;t the worst, the worst is that I simply can&#39;t even receive compliments without being criticized. I remember one day I took off glasses, one classmate saw and said: &quot;wow, you&#39;re eyes are very pretty.&quot; I was happy and was abt to reply: &quot;Thank you.&quot; before getting cut off by other girl who yelled: &quot;what are you talking about, you say her eyes are pretty? she has such small eyes.&quot; this is just many incidents that occurred. I was very self-conscious, low self-esteem, zero confident, I started getting cramps on my face when I talk to people, because I couldn&#39;t think abt anything else other than &quot;how do I look right now.&quot; I don&#39;t take pictures anymore,  I never posted my face on social media, I barely had friends. That time took a troll on me, and I realized I need to get out of my environment. So I decided to study aboard. I was getting compliments, like anything, &quot;this shirt looks so good on you!&quot; &quot;you have such lovely eyes!&quot; &quot;this dress suits you so well.&quot; and it helped me so fucking much.; Botulinum toxin is a controlled substance, considering it&#39;s one of the most potent known toxins. You could kill a person if you get it in their bloodstream or just put it in their food.<br><br>Now I&#39;m wondering if beauty clinics ever get break ins where the thief just runs off with all their botox.; Why many Korea love plastic surgery they don&#39;t believe they beautiful; Just love you self be you are why do plastic surgery and if you do plastic surgery you will loss you you real body and shape just stop doing that; It&#39;s a pity that she didn&#39;t have enough self confidence to push through with her natural looks because the truth is that she was actually naturally beautiful.; Honestly, she could’ve gotten a much better look for way less money with just a little bit of makeup, she was never ugly; Her before and after look so pretty 😍💕❤️; They look scary.; This is heartbreaking. She was so pretty before surgery. It fucking sucks that KIDS feel like they need to get surgery when they are literally still growing into their face and body. Jesus Christ.; Let me know her name; This poor sweet girl all she needed was some supportive people who would guide her in a better way <br>I can totally imagine her growing up to be a confident, independent lady with a just  groomed appearance <br>She lost that part of her life <br>Why God ..why do you need to be   soo ruthless to some people <br>😢; I just want clear skin 🥹; She could had achieve those look by using camera filter and still look human in real life. She looks really bad in real life.; isn’t this the girl that killed her husband; Some of the most &#39;beautiful&#39; women I know are very unhappy. &#39;Beauty&#39; clearly isnt everything.; Zhou looked so pretty before the surgeries its sad how she was bullied for her looks even though she was gorgeous.; Instead of spending so much money on surgery she should have switched schools where people weren’t as mean.; i dont think ppl actually realize how much your face changes from 18-25; Also let’s say on the off-chance that that beauty pageant child really is concerned that she has wrinkles.  The correct course of action is to take her out of the pageant circuit, not play into it WITH CHEMICALS; We’ve all been there with the hair.  Try not to brush or pull tension on the compromised hair that remains so that it doesn’t break, especially when it’s wet, eat nutritiously, and eventually it’ll be reduced to split ends as the rest grows out.; Girls be confident of being who you are... &quot;Confidence is the best attire to wear&quot;; Who&#39;s in 2024<br>⇩; Sad thing is that she’s was pretty before but then just destroyed it all with plastic surgery; Eeeewww knees!<br>That&#39;s so last season.<br>Everyone who is anyone knows that legs without knees is the new normal!; She was so pretty before all that damage 😢; It&#39;s not pretty, just creepy and bordering on uncanny valley territory; It&#39;s so sad, she was a beautiful girl before. The roots of her ancestors were strong in her, a blessing.; She looks like one of those uncanny DemonSlayer characters in the thumbnail; It’s weird that they get the surgery to fix some “flaw” and yet still use filters. It’s a never ending cycle; she looks like she&#39;s wearing a rubber mask. This is just sad ☹; To Asian people overseas<br>There are a lot of expeditionary surgeries.<br>&quot;Both Southeast Asians and Chinese are natural beauties<br>&quot;All Koreans are plastic.&quot;<br>When I see you do it to Koreans who don&#39;t get plastic surgery lol<br>Man is crafty.😂; Funny the ad that played at the end of your video was for facial fillers, LOL!; Imagine getting a huge dept for plastic surgeries even before you have to pay for high education; It&#39;s always so sad to see these kinds of things; To me, she is trying to look more Caucasian; Her own face was gorgeous, what the hell?; Dude I thought this said 6 for a second 🤢🤢; How sad that little girl getting botox. Her mother is an idiot.; On the one hand, the younger you are the faster and better you heal. On the other hand, the younger you are the more growth your body is going to blindly continue doing - only to go weird as bits of you are missing, or healed damage retards growth in that area.; On ty you are going to look like bizz lightyear!💀; No Brasil, temos uma cultura de: &quot;não se deve julgar quem não conheces, cada pessoa tem seu direito a fazer o que quiser do seu próprio corpo, mas é imoral um adolescente fazer cirurgias plásticas, só se for cirurgias de correção ou reconstrução&quot;. Isto é uma mentalidade que quase toda a população brasileira incluindo cirurgiões plásticos acredita e defende, contudo aos 16 anos a pessoa já pode se emancipar, ter propriedade privada, ser CEO de empesa, votar e até se casar, geralmente é aos 16 anos que muitos começam a fazer procedimentos estéticos, tatuagens.     O Brasil há alguns anos é um país que lidera o ranking de procedimentos estéticos em jovens, porém a China começa a subir no ranking, contudo porque na China já muitos carniceiros fazendo procedimentos estéticos e deixando o paciente deformado e o paciente precisa voltar a fazer mais procedimentos estéticos para concertar o que deu errado. Há alguns meses atrás uma adolescente fez um procedimento estético (no Brasil) ela tinha 16 anos, ela morreu na mesa de cirurgia, sua família fraudou exames pré operatórios, então a moça não estava bem de saúde para uma cirurgia, aí o coração não aguentou, a família culpou o médico e a clínica foi investigado, mas a polícia descobriu a fraude da família, e a família que foi presa, a moça queria muito fazer a cirurgia plástica e sua família não queria negar nada a moça, no fim isto custou a vida dela. Quando eu era mais nova só as mulheres faziam procedimentos e cirurgias para fins estéticos, atualmente estética é uma preocupação de todos os gêneros, até mesmo pessoas mais velhas e bem sucedidas com seus parceiros estáveis estão fazendo procedimentos estéticos, e até os bancos e financiadoras estão com planos para Cirurgias plásticas, basicamente uma pessoa pode ir ao banco e pedir um financiamento para fazer uma cirurgia plástica, como se fosse um financiamento para comprar uma casa ou carro, isto faz com que cirurgias plásticas sejam cada vez mais comuns em todas as camadas da sociedade. E sim, está entre as 10 mais feitas no país a cirurgia plástica na bunda (gluteoplastia).; 💘💘💘💘💘; This girl&#39;s mother paid the price of a nice house in some areas, to have her daughter look like an alien.  More money than common sense.; I see only narcissists and borderlines featured on here.; Her previous nose is big ?? Mine is double the size 😶; It&#39;s refreshing to hear someone saying it like it is . Botox at 8 for WRINKLES ?!!!! They&#39;re joking , no ? <br>Thanks for keeping it real , I just subbed .; Why does anyone ever think this is pretty. Looks like that creepy cursed doll; I didnt have plastic surgery but i went through gender transition (testosterone age 14 and mastectomy age 16) and ended up regretting it so really its just like you said kids should not be allowed to be having any type of surgeries unless its actually life threatening; &quot;Pretty knees&quot; Is funny and weird as hell. 😂😐; I actually think that she looks stuning before plastic surgery. Maybe if she wanted to she could get a good haircut and wardrobe change. Dont change urself.; This is really sad; People are erasing their traditional heritage look. Be proud of your heritage. Don&#39;t try to change it. Your brain isn&#39;t even completely developed until 25. This should be illegal for minors.; Honestly all she needed was the eyefold surgery and skin bleaching. She would have looked just fine then.; I prefer my &quot;beauty regime&quot;.  If you don&#39;t like the way I look, don&#39;t look at me.  The world offers an infinite set of distractions.  May I suggest looking at your standards perhaps.; She looked totally fine before all the procedures; Ummm no estheticians are not licensed to do Botox 😮. Unless they are a licensed medical professional then Botox should only be administered by a doctor, nurse, or physician assistant. As of 2024 that is; In my country one needs to be a DOCTOR to administrate botox. Bot even a nurse, and defenitely not a beautician.; I’m am esthetician of over 20 years, in my state (goes for most as well) a nurse or doctor must inject, estheticians don’t usually get educated on injections.; Oh! Loving the long hair...; Sick!; I actually feel so bad for these people, getting plastic surgery at such a young age should be illegal<br><br>not to mention Botox is literal poison that stops muscles working so you don&#39;t have wrinkles, and this lady is giving it to an 8 year old; The terrifying nose shape and the jaw that can be used to murder a man....; They have to be really rich omg; I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll not survive in that place omg; Love your sense of humour 😂. Crack me up; I love it ❤😂🎉; 620.000$ where the f    do you take this amount of money; I am sorry these filters are freaky looking.; these are cool :D thanks; I have to disagree. In most cases, there is no benefit to plastic surgery unless it&#39;s repairing something that was damaged in an injury. Embrace your natural beauty.; This world is so fucked up; You should do a video on Park Bom… in kpop PS is very common but I seriously think that Bom is the one idol who took it to an extreme level …; i dont even live in asia, but when i was 13 people commented on my knobby knees and it made me super insecure.<br>now years later all i can think is- wtf is wrong with people? i was a kid! of course i had knobby knees! and i naturally grew out of them. <br>why are people so weird to kids and teens?; You resemble the q2han sisters; The girls looks so nice before the surgery.; Im sorry she does not look good in photos; Sadly, I have a cousin who does these things to her daughter. She&#39;s 15, has been on hormones(afab given estrogen), has tattooed eyeliner, lip filler, botox, and likely more. All before she was 15. It&#39;s really sad.; Asian society makes you conscious about your unconscious part of your face. There is beauty privilege. Toxic beauty privilege. If you are an ugly girl, literally you are treated not as human; The worst part is she wasn&#39;t even ugly; If the mom at the end wasn&#39;t white, that child would be taken from her expeditiously. Injecting your child with Botox is abuse.<br><br>And the main baby in this video. Kills me. This poor child. She was beautiful before and should have been encouraged and loved in her own skin. Breaks my heart.; “Making money from your insecurities “Well said💯; This is why minors shouldn’t have plastic surgery; It&#39;s going to get to a point where they are either trying to look like anime characters or whole aliens.; you look different ☺️; LETS PUMP IT UP!! DEEDAA DUMDIDUMDIDUM DUM DUM DI DUM; Still she looks no beautiful 😂😂; Honestly I don’t like her look. She looks like an alien. It’s so sad what they are doing. When everyone looks the same it’s very eerie.; That &quot;mother&quot; should be arrested!; I can&#39;t express how viscerally angry this makes me. And in an ironic, twisted way, this makes me love all my flaws even more. I have huge self esteem issues, but I cannot fucking imagine making a 6 year old get botox for a fucking pagent, so it makes me want to go through a rebellion phase for her and not even wear make up today. Fucking fuck. I know this sounds dystopian, but I truly believe everyone should be put on birth control and have to go through intensive psych screenings before being allowed to have children. This is so disturbing, and guaranteed this &quot;mom&quot; will likely push her daughter into sexual situations for a &quot;win&quot;.; Loona&gt;&gt;&gt;; That view of her from the side she looks like a little old lady starved and dehydrated.<br>And why do these girls never fit the size of their ears to their new faces, their ears always end up looking huge!; I love how there is massive debate about parents supporting gender transition procedures for minor children, with religious people wanting to ban it, but where is the outrage about parents who support, or worse, force dangerous cosmetic procedures on children? Kids that are by the way MUCH younger than trans youth needing hormone therapy? Crickets.; I feel so bad for her.; Face, meet palm ✋; Who knows what the beauty standards are gonna be like in the next 10-15 years??; I love your face.; “Ok”🙄<br>*Casually sips🧋; This poor kid, she has mutilated herself in the name of popularity. 😓 She looks horrifying now. Can this Alien-Robot plastic surgery look really be the beauty standard?!? She now looks deformed and like an old porcelain doll that got smashed up a little, and glued back together poorly. 😢 She was so pretty before. I&#39;ll never understand anyone from an Asian heritage that wants to change their eyes. I think their eyes are gorgeous and while I would never personally want to have plastic surgery myself....if I suddenly woke up with monolid eyes, I would be so happy.... and of course surprised. 😅 <br><br>I don&#39;t have an &quot;Asian Fetish&quot;, but I do believe that people from East and Southeast Asia are literally the most beautiful people on this planet. I&#39;m not talking about just K-pop, J-pop, actors and influencers. I mean just the regular population. I can&#39;t say &quot;objectively beautiful&quot;, because it is an opinion, but I think they have the best gene pool when it comes to looks and the fountain of youth.  😅 <br><br>It just baffles me why anyone already so beautiful would want to have pale skin like me or double eyelids. I look like a dead body when I get into the water.  I&#39;m always afraid kids are going to start yelling &quot;Hey! There&#39;s a floater over here!&quot; and call the cops. I feel like I have negative melanin. I don&#39;t tan, instead I get horrifically burned, get super itchy as I peel, then I&#39;m white again. I&#39;ve already had skin cancer because of my aversion to the sun/UV rays (don&#39;t worry, it was removed safely, and I haven&#39;t had a reoccurrence). As for my hooded eyes, wearing makeup is just as hard, and there aren&#39;t any real benefits to having them. I dare anyone to watch a K-Drama and tell me that monolid eyes aren&#39;t expressive. 🙄 It&#39;s total bullshit and just a way to put an entire population down for their genetics. Western society loves doing that unfortunately, but I&#39;m telling you that our culture isn&#39;t any better or worse than any other culture.... it&#39;s just different. <br><br>So if you have monolids, you are beautiful, and don&#39;t let someone trick you into destroying your face for a fad. ❤ BTW, these are just my opinions.; These alien eye and smooth skin filters are the uncanny valley stuff of nightmares","The Youngest Plastic Surgery Influencer at 16 this story is wild » socials » Instagram/Twitter/Tiktok @edvasian Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/edvazian Discord ... ihate that anyone feels the need to come to such drastic methods, but honestly,  if she&#39;s happy,  i think that&#39;s more important. it is a problem,  but i can&#39;t blame her; I grew up in China, I feel like to share some of my stories regarding to beauty growing up.

Kids that are by the way MUCH younger than trans youth needing hormone therapy? Crickets.; I feel so bad for her.; Face, meet palm ✋; Who knows what the beauty standards are gonna be like in the next 10-15 years??; I love your face.; “Ok”🙄<br>*Casually sips🧋; This poor kid, she has mutilated herself in the name of popularity. 😓 She looks horrifying now. Can this Alien-Robot plastic surgery look really be the beauty standard?!? She now looks deformed and like an old porcelain doll that got smashed up a little, and glued back together poorly. 😢 She was so pretty before. I&#39;ll never understand anyone from an Asian heritage that wants to change their eyes. I think their eyes are gorgeous and while I would never personally want to have plastic surgery myself....if I suddenly woke up with monolid eyes, I would be so happy.... and of course surprised. 😅 <br><br>I don&#39;t have an &quot;Asian Fetish&quot;, but I do believe that people from East and Southeast Asia are literally the most beautiful people on this planet. I&#39;m not talking about just K-pop, J-pop, actors and influencers. I mean just the regular population. I can&#39;t say &quot;objectively beautiful&quot;, because it is an opinion, but I think they have the best gene pool when it comes to looks and the fountain of youth.  😅 <br><br>It just baffles me why anyone already so beautiful would want to have pale skin like me or double eyelids. I look like a dead body when I get into the water.  I&#39;m always afraid kids are going to start yelling &quot;Hey! There&#39;s a floater over here!&quot; and call the cops. I feel like I have negative melanin. I don&#39;t tan, instead I get horrifically burned, get super itchy as I peel, then I&#39;m white again. I&#39;ve already had skin cancer because of my aversion to the sun/UV rays (don&#39;t worry, it was removed safely, and I haven&#39;t had a reoccurrence). As for my hooded eyes, wearing makeup is just as hard, and there aren&#39;t any real benefits to having them. I dare anyone to watch a K-Drama and tell me that monolid eyes aren&#39;t expressive. 🙄 It&#39;s total bullshit and just a way to put an entire population down for their genetics. Western society loves doing that unfortunately, but I&#39;m telling you that our culture isn&#39;t any better or worse than any other culture.... it&#39;s just different. <br><br>So if you have monolids, you are beautiful, and don&#39;t let someone trick you into destroying your face for a fad. ❤ BTW, these are just my opinions.; These alien eye and smooth skin filters are the uncanny valley

influencers aren&#39;t to blame for the toxic beauty standards. we are.,Stephanie Lange,2023-06-29T18:00:15Z,"now here i am responding to my own video (have I lost the plot lol) but in all seriousness, I think we can acknowledge that the ...",NgKbO-eT3oQ,"Whose fault is it then? When do victims become perpetrators? They are choosing to profit off the beauty standards (EARNING), while the rest of us PAY to get a tiny bit closer to the beauty standards they promote.; Look at Khloe Kardashian she got soooo bullied when they first found fame, “the fat sister”, “the less feminine looking one” etc even having less option at photo shoots because stylists couldn’t be bothered to look for nice pieces in her size. <br><br>So OF COURSE she got plastic surgery, you tell someone how ugly they are and what’s wrong with them and they have the money to “fix” those things and then we harass them for conforming to what others say is beautiful and blame them for the beauty standards when we are the ones who have bullied them into those conforming to them. We are hypocrites; Your Videos are my evening routine❤️; People hate the truth, keep talking; Honestly thank you so darn much for this video it took such a long time to realize how toxic fake and bad this world is I&#39;ve been trying to improve my looks what and it  has made my depression even worse there a time where I feel like crying cause I can&#39;t keep up to those crazy ass standers. And at some point I have considered plastic surgery and at that moment I knew something was off people should really change; Great videos. Keep it coming and bring it as it really is. Loving all these videos; I like what you said about us having a power over the beauty standards as well as about having a daughter. A have a daughter, she’s 1yo, so tiny and clueless so far, but your videos made me think about how I’m going to teach her to accept her body when she’s older. I have a ton of insecurities, so I honestly have no idea. But recently I noticed, that she has the exact same shape of eyebrows as me. Light in color, but quite hairy and bushy, forming a little swirl in the middle, almost a unibrow 😂 so something I was very insecure about, I needed to pluck them or hide behind glasses. But since I noticed, she looks like me in that aspect, I was like “ I’m never plucking my eyebrows again! This is so cute!” I don’t know if that will be enough for her, and I still have a lot to work on when it comes to accept myself, but this a little step in the right direction, I never expected ✨🙏; Sometimes when you are advocating for the underdog, you accidentally insult the other side&#39;s appearance. <br><br>For example, in one video you discussed jaw surgery. To defend women who are insecure about their soft jaws, you insulted strong jaws and told the women that they are beautiful without them (which is so true!). However, as someone who is insecure about their strong jaw, that offhand remark struck me unexpectedly. I don&#39;t quite fit the beauty standard either, and that remark reasserted that.<br><br>It was such a minor and unintended thing (i love your work!), but when you get comments accusing you of bashing women i wonder if that&#39;s part of the reason why.<br><br>BUT ULTIMATELY, I think your content is so important for girls and women today; so few people know how real edited images can look. I hope you keep working and creating for a long time!! &lt;3; I absolutely love your videos and content!!; Your amazing!!! ❤❤❤; Plastic/cosmetic surgery can cause diseases so they are risking their health to look more beautiful. Diseases don&#39;t care how much money a person has nor does it discriminate. A lot of people regret doing plastic/cosmetic surgery when the negative results set it.; Are you still talking?; I personally find your videos enlightening.   Being exposed to the &quot;truth&quot; finally helps me see I&#39;m not as flawed or ugly as I thought I was compared to others.   I&#39;m human,  as everyone else is too.  So thank you for all of the hard work you put into making these videos.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgKbO-eT3oQ&amp;t=397"">6:37</a> “I wanna see your ancestors in YOU.” One of the most beautiful lines I’ve ever heard love you and thank you❤; This is a great video and very well said! It’s a message that NEEDS to be blunt at this point because people refuse to understand any other way; Do these people that say you shame women even watch the video? They are literal trolls cuz idk how anyone with eyes and ears can watch your video and say you shamed or bashed anyone.; You are so right; I totally agree; 💓; This is a really good video, good summarize; I usually criticize but stephanie is the sweetest person; Stephanie calls everyone beautiful even if they are not. In our opinion; I&#39;m in agreement with you Steph. How can women make the most of themselves if they&#39;re being told its not enough.; I don&#39;t believe some of these influencers would actually be relieved, because Kim K had bills to pay and she profits of of everybody idolizing her and wanting to buy the stuff she sells to come a little bit closer to being her; By definition, an &quot;influencer&quot; is meant to influence the general public&#39;s attitudes and ideas, and actually get <b>paid</b> for it. So there&#39;s an inherent degree of responsibility in that. A lot of influencers are toxic and have promoted the ridiculous beauty standards that many people have come to accept. I do think that most of it originates or is reinforced with online content.  I&#39;ve never felt there were any issues with your own content, a lot of it gives great insight...but I don&#39;t agree with this blanket statement that &quot;influencers are not to blame&quot;. A lot of them are, at least more so than the person being &quot;influenced&quot;. And as you even say, beauty standards have gotten a lot more out of control in recent years...there&#39;s a reason behind that.; Im glad that there is someone out there that is honest about procedures „perfecting“ people, when in most of the cases they do the exact opposite.; Stephanie you have to speak more often and louder!; <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a>💗💗💗 I support you!!! It easier to blame you than to be accountable of this. In Argentina we have a saying that says dont kill the postman for bringing bad news!!! XOXO Paula; I feel everything you say. That&#39;s why I subscribed. These videos help me so much with my self esteem. I have a daughter and definitely anxious about her future. ❤️; I understand your mission, keep doing your thing. If someone is misunderstanding these videos, that’s weird.; This! 🙏 Stefani has a very important point here about ground breaking change making power. Power of understanding, empathy, respect and love. Ladies we need to own and actively practice our power, so we can rule the world🎉; I would like to add, a lot of people project their insecurities on these models, infleuncers, etc. These people are the first to put down, shame, and judge other women. These people are also the type to also follow the steps of these influencers and still blame the influencers. It’s a cycle.; Stupid ignorant people follow stupid ignorant people. Learn some self respect and self love and stop being a clone. You were never created to be a slave. Wake up people and take some accountability for your stupid life decisions; I could listen to You for hours. It&#39;s always very refreshing and pleasing. :) Greetings Stephanie ^^; The day a famous woman  can come out without makeup and filters and sets her personal life and professional life apart is when this desperation around looks end. Its body. It changes. It dies.; Steph, you are a hero. Zoomers are just brainless trolls.; Your videos gives me confidence, knowing that I am fine and all the people on social media just use filters and possing. Every time I feel bad about me, I watch your videos and I feel hot again. Thank you so much for that ❤️; Sweetie, please STOP LISTENING TO THE HATERS,  Your channel has value, it&#39;s informative, and it&#39;s what&#39;s missing today.. Remember, they only attack you because you are exposing their ability to con, falsely advertise.. And basically lie, and collect money!!!  I&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t MORE people calling out the crap that our kids are buying!!  Keep being yourself, your channel does have purpose❤; Thank you Stephanie, thank you for all your videos.; Woooow girl, I admire how well you put these things into words!!! Whoever says these things about you, clearly doesn&#39;t understand you and the problem. I am totally on your side ❤❤❤; Your videos help many women seriously thank you so much.; &quot;I want to see your ancestors on your face&quot;....yeeeessss! 🙏🏽; I don’t think they saw the video, the message it’s perfectly clear. And as a normal woman I think this kind of content is REALLY necessary. I’ve had wide hips all my life, though I was thin and strong, but I was classified as fat (in the insulting way, not there’s nothing wrong about just being fat) but because they used it as an insult. And I’ve always thought there was something wrong with my body as a teenager. Now I get comments about if I’ve done a BBL, again in the negative judging way… For god’s sake, when are we gonna learn that bodies have millions of shapes, colours, textures! And they just are, and it’s not anyone else business. But we are so brainwashed by media, not just social media now, there’s always been something (like SupePop in my time). We need to normalised this now, ASAP, and Stephanie is making a great job.; I love Stefanie ♥️ 💪 you have Courage 👍 I am so proud of you 👏; Stephanie is way prettier than these other women. SO gorgeous!; i 100% agree with you; not just the kardarshians are to blame (i hate them) but every regular human like any one of us might be to blame - if we over rely on filters and facetune then WE create the &quot;majority&quot; on peoples feeds. everyone knows the kj have fake bodies, so its the regular folk who makes most impact on regular folk. <br><br>i suppose every change need to start from ourselves - make a positive example; Also if you think boys aren’t having that same pressure then you are completely misinformed; Thank you for this video, Stephanie. You’re the feminist icon we need in the beauty community. Power to you for pointing out the toxic standards women are held to ❤; I love your content I don&#39;t think your content is bad at all you help a lot of women  love themselves naturally and all that continue with the good work we will always support you becouse not everyone has courage to do that; You&#39;re incredibly talented!; I&#39;m a mom to a boy and I&#39;m still anxious about his future self esteem; I’d love to leave the house without makeup sometimes too but people are always going to look at me and say “what’s wrong??”; you seem like one of the biggest advocates of women and natural beauty. please don’t listen to unnecessary hate ❤ you’re a light in this wild influencer world!; “I just love a good rant “ <br>Guuurl , me too ! 🤣😂😅🤭; No it’s true we do perpetuate it. It’s been 2 months since I deleted all of my social media; besides YouTube, and I am so much more happier. Stop idolizing these filthy rich people and focus on your own life! Social media is the biggest waste of your time, trust me. The only way to stop this is to just delete it all, you’ll be healthier and happier without it.; How about this? Both are responsible.; Stephanie, você é necessária! Não se importe com essas mulheres amarguradas e alienadas.; Whatever they do its upto them. Have a life lady! Btw your are using filter you don&#39;t need to lie about it.; we would believe that you stand up for the underdog and your average woman... only if you yourself were authentic as well... so  actually removing all that makeup; actually, society is going to have a 180 degree turn when it comes to who will care more about their looks in the upcoming generations.. men or women. I truly believe men will make that shift. Have you seen the blackpill content out there? It&#39;s scary and men will start to go through even worse lengths to get to supermodel looks. Men are woken up that they can&#39;t get the women they want cause women have made the list so crazy. 6&#39;0 feet tall, tan skin, femine looks, clean face, stylish clothes, long hair, six pack etc. Then add that he needs to be earning min $150K, have a corvette, have social skills, have status,  just to get a 6+ girl in looks (W/ makeup). Insane. I actually would rather have girls than boys. Life of a man was already tough but now things are going to get even more difficult.; A girl who looks like an Instagram baddie telling us that the standards are unrealistic and that we should love ourselves lol what&#39;s new<br>You absolutely follow the standards and you&#39;re perpetuating them. You&#39;re capitalizing on people&#39;s insecurities with your videos.; Agree ! We are . People have the power to kill any influencer . Open your eyes people please . Think of the younger generations !; Bella opened up about having a nose job and now Selena’s stans  attack her for having fake beauty, when in reality Selena had just as much work done, but gaslights people… And people are wondering why most of celebrities are being quiet??  They gain nothing from telling the truth!! <br>The audience wants and expects them to be alien like, when they show their weaknesses and human side, people bash them because most people are jealous and envious of those more successful and rich.; One of the reasons I don&#39;t alter my looks is, Letang face it.  TIME CONSUMING.  Not to mention expensive.  If I decide I want to go somewhere,  I just need to my keys and go.  I&#39;ve seen others take two hours to get ready.; Yup.  I&#39;m 60.  No makeup.  I get accused of being way older than I am because I don&#39;t dye my hair.  I see people I went to school with and it&#39;s obvious all hair is dyed.; I so agree!!!  I tried to make that same comments on one of the social news outlets and guess what —- the site wouldn’t allow me too!! Crazy!!!  Thank you for being you!! You sing it!!; How about we don’t make other people responsible for our self esteem?; I agree with you. I remember being a newlywed. My then husband and I had never lived together before our marriage, we had been on vacations though, so he knew what I looked like with no makeup on before we got married. I remember about 2 months into the marriage, he was close to our apartment so he decided to stop by for lunch. I had been cleaning the aptartment, so I was wearing sweat pants and an old tshirt. I had my hair pulled back in a pony tail, I had on no makeup and I was scrubbing the toilet. My husband looked at me and he asked me why I looked like I did, why didn&#39;t I look like the wives on his mother&#39;s  soap opera shows. Oh man, I remember telling him that I probably could look like that (I had done some modeling in my teens) if he wanted to hire a makeup artist to come do my makeup and hair each day and if he wanted to hire a cleaning lady to clean our apartment and hire a caterer or chef to cook our food. I told him I had no problem, I would love for a limo to come pick me up so I could go shopping and I&#39;d love to spend my days at the pool or visiting museums or at the spa. I said give me that lifestyle and I&#39;ll  try my best to look like a soap opera actress when you come home. I can be home all dolled up drinking wine and eating bon bons when you come home. I told  him all that sounded like a lot more fun than cleaning up after a slob husband and how sorry I was for not looking beautiful and glamorous as I scrubbed his piss stains off the toilet. I was angry and justly so. I knew that day I&#39;d made a big mistake getting married to that man. He wasn&#39;t  looking like Mr. GQ when he said that crap to me either. Later on I had a BF tell me to face it without my makeup I was no beauty queen but he liked that because it meant less guys would flirt with me and I probably wouldn&#39;t  leave him, oh man was he wrong! It was adios Ah*le.😂; &quot;They have hair on their toes...annnd their BUTTS&quot; 😂😂😂 love her, she says the funniest stuff!!; Motor mouth!!!!!!; No honey you are scrutinizing!!!!; You know she’s getting passionate about what she’s talking about when the neck and ear start turning red lol; Very interesting conversation!; ❤❤❤❤PREACH!!❤❤❤❤; Don’t stop doing this, you don’t know the difference you’re making in so many women 🫶🏻; I&#39;m glad I finally realized they are doing the fiiters / editing just to sell me something and make money for themselves :(; I feel that you are part of this. Your instagram is very full with filters. 😳 I feel none of us should have instagram at all.; I am sorry not everyone understand your point. Gotta give a big tumb up !; Thank you for the work you are doing. Thank you for your courage to speak up 👏🏼; Stephanie I would love you to show how Kim k now looks like madonna, because of all the fillers, nose jobs and lip jobs. At the Milan fashion week we caught a glimpse of the horror. Age and lies just catch up with us eventually.; This was a REALLY good one!!; We are at a pivotal moment in time that all deception and lies are being exposed by the light and that real natural beauty is coming back. And that beauty primarily comes from within, not so much emphasis on the external beauty.; you are really great at this, you have the perfect perception on this; What you are doing is called victim blaming, “poor celebrities needing to get plastic surgery because of horrible bullies regular people “ 🤡 Common! Were you paid by a celebrity agent to make this video ?🤔; Please do a make up tutorial - You Look amazing 😍🔥; I also would absolutely NEVER want a daughter as someone who grew up as a girl. I&#39;d never want someone to suffer as much as I did simply for being a girl.; Stephanie we can’t say all this when we wear makeup…; Have you heard about adrenachrome and like baby foreskin?!? Weird stuff.; MUCH LOVE... ❤❤❤... AND HERE&#39;S TO CLEAR SKIN... ROSACEA FREE... 🎉🎉🎉; Love you,  please consider... <br>IT WAS IN THE NEW WORLD ORDERS&#39; BEST INTEREST TO TAKE AWAY OUR MEAT... THEY TRULY WANT US DEAD... OR IN SUCH A WEAKENED STATE THAT WE CANT THINK COHERENTLY... NOR WILL WE BE STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEND OURSELF... 👿👿👿... <br>NO BUGS FOR ME SATAN... NO BUGS FOR ME<br>... THE DEVIL IS A LIE... 🤥🤥🤥; This makes me think of Alesia Cara’s song “Scars to your Beautiful”.......”So to all the girls who are hurting let me be your mirror, help you see a little more clear, the light that shines within”.; Girl we’re with you Stephanie!; That’s show how people are super hypocrite if the video was about Kylie Jenner or the Kardashians they will react different such sad world; I love your stance, Stephanie. I&#39;d love to see a tour of your dusty garage and lighting.; Love your attitude and the fact that u stand up for what u do. Please continue cuz probably those who criticize you, cannot simply understand the message.; Lol; You have the best and most positiv content out there!; You&#39;re saving women from crazy and unrealistic beauty standars they are always pressured to achieve. Keep going, we need it.; I actually think you&#39;re too mild sometimes when talking about all the wrong sides of social media, I&#39;d never think you&#39;re doing something wrong or against women","influencers aren&#39;t to blame for the toxic beauty standards. we are. now here i am responding to my own video (have I lost the plot lol) but in all seriousness, I think we can acknowledge that the ... Whose fault is it then? When do victims become perpetrators? They are choosing to profit off the beauty standards (EARNING), while the rest of us PAY to get a tiny bit closer to the beauty standards they promote.; Look at Khloe Kardashian she got soooo bullied when they first found fame, “the fat sister”, “the less feminine looking one” etc even having less option at photo shoots because stylists couldn’t be bothered to look for nice pieces in her size. <br><br>So OF COURSE she got plastic surgery, you tell someone how ugly they are and what’s wrong with them and they have the money to “fix” those things and then we harass them for conforming to what others say is beautiful and blame them for the beauty standards when we are the ones who have bullied them into those conforming to them. We are hypocrites; Your Videos are my evening routine❤️; People hate the truth, keep talking; Honestly thank you so darn much for this video it took such a long time to realize how toxic fake and bad this world is I&#39;ve been trying to improve my looks what and it  has made my depression even worse there a time where I feel like crying cause I can&#39;t keep up to those crazy ass standers. And at some point I have considered plastic surgery and at that moment I knew something was off people should really change; Great videos. Keep it coming and bring it as it really is. Loving all these videos; I like what you said about us having a power over the beauty standards as well as about having a daughter. A have a daughter, she’s 1yo, so tiny and clueless so far, but your videos made me think about how I’m going to teach her to accept her body when she’s older. I have a ton of insecurities, so I honestly have no idea. But recently I noticed, that she has the exact same shape of eyebrows as me. Light in color, but quite hairy and bushy, forming a little swirl in the middle, almost a unibrow 😂 so something I was very insecure about, I needed to pluck them or hide behind glasses. But since I noticed, she looks like me in that aspect, I was like “ I’m never plucking my eyebrows again! This is so cute!” I don’t know if that will be enough for her, and I still have a lot to work on when it comes to accept myself, but this a little step in the right direction, I never expected ✨🙏; Sometimes when you are advocating for the underdog, you accidentally insult the other side&#39;s appearance. <br><br>For example, in one video you discussed jaw surgery. To defend women who are insecure about their soft jaws, you insulted strong jaws and told the women that they are beautiful without them (which is so true!). However, as someone who is insecure about their strong jaw, that offhand remark struck me unexpectedly. I don&#39;t quite fit the beauty standard either, and that remark reasserted that.<br><br>It was such a minor and unintended thing (i love your work!), but when you get comments accusing you of bashing women i wonder if that&#39;s part of the reason why.<br><br>BUT ULTIMATELY, I think your content is so important for girls and women today; so few people know how real edited images can look. I hope you keep working and creating for a long time!! &lt;3; I absolutely love your videos and content!!; Your amazing!!! ❤❤❤; Plastic/cosmetic surgery can cause diseases so they are risking their health to look more beautiful. Diseases don&#39;t care how much money a person has nor does it discriminate. A lot of people regret doing plastic/cosmetic surgery when the negative results set it.; Are you still talking?; I personally find your videos enlightening.   Being exposed to the &quot;truth&quot; finally helps me see I&#39;m not as flawed or ugly as I thought I was compared to others.   I&#39;m human,  as everyone else is too.  So thank you for all of the hard work you put into making these videos.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgKbO-eT3oQ&amp;t=397"">6:37</a> “I wanna see your ancestors in YOU.” One of the most beautiful lines I’ve ever heard love you and thank you❤; This is a great video and very well said! It’s a message that NEEDS to be blunt at this point because people refuse to understand any other way; Do these people that say you shame women even watch the video? They are literal trolls cuz idk how anyone with eyes and ears can watch your video and say you shamed or bashed anyone.; You are so right; I totally agree; 💓; This is a really good video, good summarize; I usually criticize but stephanie is the sweetest person; Stephanie calls everyone beautiful even if they are not. In our opinion; I&#39;m in agreement with you Steph. How can women make the most of themselves if they&#39;re being told its not enough.; I don&#39;t believe some of these influencers would actually be relieved, because Kim K had bills to pay and she profits of of everybody idolizing her and wanting to buy the stuff she sells to come a little bit closer to being her; By definition, an &quot;influencer&quot; is meant to influence the general public&#39;s attitudes and ideas, and actually get <b>paid</b> for it. So there&#39;s an inherent degree of responsibility in that. A lot of influencers are toxic and have promoted the ridiculous beauty standards that many people have come to accept. I do think that most of it originates or is reinforced with online content.  I&#39;ve never felt there were any issues with your own content, a lot of it gives great insight...but I don&#39;t agree with this blanket statement that &quot;influencers are not to blame&quot;. A lot of them are, at least more so than the person being &quot;influenced&quot;. And as you even say, beauty standards have gotten a lot more out of control in recent years...there&#39;s a reason behind that.; Im glad that there is someone out there that is honest about procedures „perfecting“ people, when in most of the cases they do the exact opposite.; Stephanie you have to speak more often and louder!; <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a>💗💗💗 I support you!!! It easier to blame you than to be accountable of this. In Argentina we have a saying that says dont kill the postman for bringing bad news!!! XOXO Paula; I feel everything you say. That&#39;s why I subscribed. These videos help me so much with my self esteem. I have a daughter and definitely anxious about her future. ❤️; I understand your mission, keep doing your thing. If someone is misunderstanding these videos, that’s weird.; This! 🙏 Stefani has a very important point here about ground breaking change making power. Power of understanding, empathy, respect and love. Ladies we need to own and actively practice our power, so we can rule the world🎉; I would like to add, a lot of people project their insecurities on these models, infleuncers, etc. These people are the first to put down, shame, and judge other women. These people are also the type to also follow the steps of these influencers and still blame the influencers. It’s a cycle.; Stupid ignorant people follow stupid ignorant people. Learn some self respect and self love and stop being a clone. You were never created to be a slave. Wake up people and take some accountability for your stupid life decisions; I could listen to You for hours. It&#39;s always very refreshing and pleasing. :) Greetings Stephanie ^^; The day a famous woman  can come out without makeup and filters and sets her personal life and professional life apart is when this desperation around looks end. Its body. It changes. It dies.; Steph, you are a hero. Zoomers are just brainless trolls.; Your videos gives me confidence, knowing that I am fine and all the people on social media just use filters and possing. Every time I feel bad about me, I watch your videos and I feel hot again. Thank you so much for that ❤️; Sweetie, please STOP LISTENING TO THE HATERS,  Your channel has value, it&#39;s informative, and it&#39;s what&#39;s missing today.. Remember, they only attack you because you are exposing their ability to con, falsely advertise.. And basically lie, and collect money!!!  I&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t MORE people calling out the crap that our kids are buying!!  Keep being yourself, your channel does have purpose❤; Thank you Stephanie, thank you for all your videos.; Woooow girl, I admire how well you put these things into words!!! Whoever says these things about you, clearly doesn&#39;t understand you and the problem. I am totally on your side ❤❤❤; Your videos help many women seriously thank you so much.; &quot;I want to see your ancestors on your face&quot;....yeeeessss! 🙏🏽; I don’t think they saw the video, the message it’s perfectly clear. And as a normal woman I think this kind of content is REALLY necessary. I’ve had wide hips all my life, though I was thin and strong, but I was classified as fat (in the insulting way, not there’s nothing wrong about just being fat) but because they used it as an insult. And I’ve always thought there was something wrong with my body as a teenager. Now I get comments about if I’ve done a BBL, again in the negative judging way… For god’s sake, when are we gonna learn that bodies have millions of shapes, colours, textures! And they just are, and it’s not anyone else business. But we are so brainwashed by media, not just social media now, there’s always been something (like SupePop in my time). We need to normalised this now, ASAP, and Stephanie is making a great job.; I love Stefanie ♥️ 💪 you have Courage 👍 I am so proud of you 👏; Stephanie is way prettier than these other women. SO gorgeous!; i 100% agree with you; not just the kardarshians are to blame (i hate them) but every regular human like any one of us might be to blame - if we over rely on filters and facetune then WE create the &quot;majority&quot; on peoples feeds. everyone knows the kj have fake bodies, so its the regular folk who makes most impact on regular folk. <br><br>i suppose every change need to start from ourselves - make a positive example; Also if you think boys aren’t having that same pressure then you are completely misinformed; Thank you for this video, Stephanie. You’re the feminist icon we need in the beauty community. Power to you for pointing out the toxic standards women are held to ❤; I love your content I don&#39;t think your content is bad at all you help a lot of women  love themselves naturally and all that continue with the good work we will always support you becouse not everyone has courage to do that; You&#39;re incredibly talented!; I&#39;m a mom to a boy and I&#39;m still anxious about his future self esteem; I’d love to leave the house without makeup sometimes too but people are always going to look at me and say “what’s wrong??”; you seem like one of the biggest advocates of women and natural beauty. please don’t listen to unnecessary hate ❤ you’re a light in this wild influencer world!; “I just love a good rant “ <br>Guuurl , me too ! 🤣😂😅🤭; No it’s true we do perpetuate it. It’s been 2 months since I deleted all of my social media; besides YouTube, and I am so much more happier. Stop idolizing these filthy rich people and focus on your own life! Social media is the biggest waste of your time, trust me. The only way to stop this is to just delete it all, you’ll be healthier and happier without it.; How about this? Both are responsible.; Stephanie, você é necessária! Não se importe com essas mulheres amarguradas e alienadas.; Whatever they do its upto them. Have a life lady! Btw your are using filter you don&#39;t need to lie about it.; we would believe that you stand up for the underdog and your average woman... only if you yourself were authentic as well... so  actually removing all that makeup; actually, society is going to have a 180 degree turn when it comes to who will care more about their looks in the upcoming generations.. men or women. I truly believe men will make that shift. Have you seen the blackpill content out there? It&#39;s scary and men will start to go through even worse lengths to get to supermodel looks. Men are woken up that they can&#39;t get the women they want cause women have made the list so crazy. 6&#39;0 feet tall, tan skin, femine looks, clean face, stylish clothes, long hair, six pack etc. Then add that he needs to be earning min $150K, have a corvette, have social skills, have status,  just to get a 6+ girl in looks (W/ makeup). Insane. I actually would rather have girls than boys. Life of a man was already tough but now things are going to get even more difficult.; A girl who looks like an Instagram baddie telling us that the standards are unrealistic and that we should love ourselves lol what&#39;s new<br>You absolutely follow the standards and you&#39;re perpetuating them. You&#39;re capitalizing on people&#39;s insecurities with your videos.; Agree ! We are . People have the power to kill any influencer . Open your eyes people please . Think of the younger generations !; Bella opened up about having a nose job and now Selena’s stans  attack her for having fake beauty, when in reality Selena had just as much work done, but gaslights people… And people are wondering why most of celebrities are being quiet??  They gain nothing from telling the truth!! <br>The audience wants and expects them to be alien like, when they show their weaknesses and human side, people bash them because most people are jealous and envious of those more successful and rich.; One of the reasons I don&#39;t alter my looks is, Letang face it.  TIME CONSUMING.  Not to mention expensive.  If I decide I want to go somewhere,  I just need to my keys and go.  I&#39;ve seen others take two hours to get ready.; Yup.  I&#39;m 60.  No makeup.  I get accused of being way older than I am because I don&#39;t dye my hair.  I see people I went to school with and it&#39;s obvious all hair is dyed.; I so agree!!!  I tried to make that same comments on one of the social news outlets and guess what —- the site wouldn’t allow me too!! Crazy!!!  Thank you for being you!! You sing it!!; How about we don’t make other people responsible for our self esteem?; I agree with you. I remember being a newlywed. My then husband and I had never lived together before our marriage, we had been on vacations though, so he knew what I looked like with no makeup on before we got married. I remember about 2 months into the marriage, he was close to our apartment so he decided to stop by for lunch. I had been cleaning the aptartment, so I was wearing sweat pants and an old tshirt. I had my hair pulled back in a pony tail, I had on no makeup and I was scrubbing the toilet. My husband looked at me and he asked me why I looked like I did, why didn&#39;t I look like the wives on his mother&#39;s  soap opera shows. Oh man, I remember telling him that I probably could look like that (I had done some modeling in my teens) if he wanted to hire a makeup artist to come do my makeup and hair each day and if he wanted to hire a cleaning lady to clean our apartment and hire a caterer or chef to cook our food. I told him I had no problem, I would love for a limo to come pick me up so I could go shopping and I&#39;d love to spend my days at the pool or visiting museums or at the spa. I said give me that lifestyle and I&#39;ll  try my best to look like a soap opera actress when you come home. I can be home all dolled up drinking wine and eating bon bons when you come home. I told  him all that sounded like a lot more fun than cleaning up after a slob husband and how sorry I was for not looking beautiful and glamorous as I scrubbed his piss stains off the toilet. I was angry and justly so. I knew that day I&#39;d made a big mistake getting married to that man. He wasn&#39;t  looking like Mr. GQ when he said that crap to me either. Later on I had a BF tell me to face it without my makeup I was no beauty queen but he liked that because it meant less guys would flirt with me and I probably wouldn&#39;t  leave him, oh man was he wrong! It was adios Ah*le.😂; &quot;They have hair on their toes...annnd their BUTTS&quot; 😂😂😂 love her, she says the funniest stuff!!; Motor mouth!!!!!!; No honey you are scrutinizing!!!!; You know she’s getting passionate about what she’s talking about when the neck and ear start turning red lol; Very interesting conversation!; ❤❤❤❤PREACH!!❤❤❤❤; Don’t stop doing this, you don’t know the difference you’re making in so many women 🫶🏻; I&#39;m glad I finally realized they are doing the fiiters / editing just to sell me something and make money for themselves :(; I feel that you are part of this. Your instagram is very full with filters. 😳 I feel none of us should have instagram at all.; I am sorry not everyone understand your point. Gotta give a big tumb up !; Thank you for the work you are doing. Thank you for your courage to speak up 👏🏼; Stephanie I would love you to show how Kim k now looks like madonna, because of all the fillers, nose jobs and lip jobs. At the Milan fashion week we caught a glimpse of the horror. Age and lies just catch up with us eventually.; This was a REALLY good one!!; We are at a pivotal moment in time that all deception and lies are being exposed by the light and that real natural beauty is coming back. And that beauty primarily comes from within, not so much emphasis on the external beauty.; you are really great at this, you have the perfect perception on this; What you are doing is called victim blaming, “poor celebrities needing to get plastic surgery because of horrible bullies regular people “ 🤡 Common! Were you paid by a celebrity agent to make this video ?🤔; Please do a make up tutorial - You Look amazing 😍🔥; I also would absolutely NEVER want a daughter as someone who grew up as a girl. I&#39;d never want someone to suffer as much as I did simply for being a girl.; Stephanie we can’t say all this when we wear makeup…; Have you heard about adrenachrome and like baby foreskin?!? Weird stuff.; MUCH LOVE... ❤❤❤... AND HERE&#39;S TO CLEAR SKIN... ROSACEA FREE... 🎉🎉🎉; Love you,  please consider... <br>IT WAS IN THE NEW WORLD ORDERS&#39; BEST INTEREST TO TAKE AWAY OUR MEAT...

THE DEVIL IS A LIE... 🤥🤥🤥; This makes me think of Alesia Cara’s song “Scars to your Beautiful”.......”So to all the girls who are hurting let me be your mirror, help you see a little more clear, the light that shines within”.; Girl we’re with you Stephanie!; That’s show how people are super hypocrite if the video was about Kylie Jenner or the Kardashians they will react different such sad world; I love your stance, Stephanie. I&#39;d love to see a tour of your dusty garage and lighting.; Love your attitude and the fact that u stand up for what u do.

Is Body Positivity Affecting the Japanese Dangerous Beauty Standard?,Michelle McDaniel,2023-03-18T15:30:51Z,"Watch the explosive love is blind reunion when the ""nice guys"" get exposed!: ""(1247) When The Nice Guys Get Exposed | Love is ...",aclhXnR79uY,"Thank you for watching!!!! Check out more videos!<br><br>Youtubers Aba n Preach CALL ME OUT- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZTp2qM0_SQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZTp2qM0_SQ</a><br><br>Husband would rather Wife Die than lose weight!- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADE2W7FQfuU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADE2W7FQfuU</a>; BB.     , 🇵🇬🇵🇬; Have been living in Japan for 7 years. I&#39;m an ex anorexic. I arrived thin, was called &quot;beautiful&quot;, discovered weight training here, and progressively built a strong body that people said looked &quot;cool&quot; (but not &quot;beautiful&quot; anymore). Then I had fertility treatments and stopped exercising, got pregnant twice on a row which left me with a curvy body with a BMI of 24. So yeah, not so &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; anymore. Everybody was making fun of how fat I got. My boss, who I also considered a friend, called me a &quot;sumo&quot;, a &quot;pig&quot;, an &quot;obese&quot;. My ob-gyn told me at every appointment that I was approaching obesity (I only gained 8kg in pregnancy...). It was really unnerving because I knew I could lose weight easily, and I planned on losing weight after giving birth anyway. But their remarks really made me fall back towards anorexia. I lost 20kg in 4 months, going down to a 18.5 BMI, basically only eating 800 calories a day for 4 months and working my soul out at the gym. And then, the magic happened: &quot;wow Sara, you got so beautiful!&quot; &quot;how did you lose weight? What&#39;s your secret?&quot;. They were expecting me to give them a magical recipe because in their head it&#39;s impossible an &quot;ex-fat&quot; person has the determination to lose weight through effort and pain. I answered: &quot;I stopped eating. I was almost anorexic thanks to all the pressure I received from everyone around me&quot; and everybody suddenly lost interest. 😅; Remember we only get this far because we hog down on poison. Every fat Japanese person I know, eats healthy meals, and then has either larger portions or one or two snacks for 200-600 excess calories a day.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> she&#39;s not even Japanese, she&#39;s Korean 😭; Oh No! There goes Tokio!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=255"">4:15</a> it had nothing to do with white people though. It was more about the fact that if you spent time in the sun that meant you were poor and worked in the fields or outside a lot. It was the same in europe. Tan = poor, pale = rich.; Michelle! you have a very important voice. this video encompasses WHY I love your content. Don&#39;t stop. This sh*t is important right now. And you&#39;re being honest and doing your job. Thank you!; Balance. Life is about balance. Too far in either direction is no bueno. Everyone has a different baseline sure, but our bodies know what is “our healthy normal” and always strives for that through homeostasis. We mess us the process interjecting. I used to be an emotional eater. Once I picked up a different hobby to do when I was upset? I stopped being a chunker. Period. Got my arse moving and it melted off.  Added a lil weight resistance and toned it all up. It’s not hard, but it’s hard to START.  Music was my motivation. Since I knew my habits were tied to my emotions I got a gym membership and every time I was triggered emotionally I would have my angsty playlist and gym clothes ready. Instead of taking it out on my body, I took it out of my body with sweat. Never felt better than after those workouts. 💯; ‼️‼️IMPORTANT: pan xiaoting is NOT dead. Those pictures used in this video are NOT pictures of pan, they are of a completely different Chinese influencer on douyin who is also not dead. cicilovecheese has an entire video about it on her tiktok. This is fake news. Please do your due diligence atozy. It’s been illegal to film mukbang in China since 2020. And no one is dead the girl in video known as 9-ball is married and recently got pregnant. She has set her douyin to private to avoid people swarming her page. The story comes from a tabloid site in China and the sun picked it up as a fellow tabloid site to spread the misinformation but I will repeat it is NOT true. She did not die live on stream, no one did. No where on the Sun article does it say that, she’s not even really a huge mukbang personality, she’s just fat.; 🎃; I&#39;m considered &quot;skinny&quot; in north America. I&#39;m actually overweight, not obese, but I need to lose 20 pounds (and I am doing that lol).<br><br>In Japan, I&#39;d stick out HARD. I&#39;m 5&#39;9&quot;, super pale (I glow in pictures where there&#39;s sunlight..) and very pale haired lmao. My son literally is so blonde, his hair looks nearly void of pigment. My best friend is too, actually, and she says my son is actually hers 😂 we look like aliens, I know lmao.<br><br>But yeah, I will never forget walking through Chapters one time and this beautiful, very small Japanese woman (I heard her speaking Japanese, I know a little, so I know when I hear it). Poor thing looked at me and looked  scared? I have broad shoulders, and I&#39;m really tall, I was also wearing a bit of a heel. You&#39;d swear the woman saw a ghost or an alien, she was so shocked.<br>As we&#39;ve got more of a diverse community, we have a little more people from China, Korea, and Japan.<br>Well, not too long ago, a young woman (I couldn&#39;t hear the language she spoke, so I&#39;m unsure what culture her ideals are formed from) but she saw me and started laughing so hard. I&#39;m built like a freaking ox, smaller than my brothers but my brothers are huge (not overweight huge, stature. Like 6&#39;2&quot; to 6&#39;4&quot; and 200+ pounds. My oldest brother has always been thinner than our middle brother, but our middle brother has always lifted weights and has huge muscles).<br>It&#39;s wild how customs change so much from one culture to another. Here, I get hit on <b>constantly.</b> but I know if I went to Japan or China, it&#39;d be a really different story lol. I&#39;ve always admired Japanese culture from afar, but every culture has its downsides and for me, hating freckles (something that is part if my people, my father came from Scotland and spoke Gaelic, we are literally painted in freckles) and mocking strong bodies is something that has and would keep me from moving there. Before I really knew about that aspect of their culture, I would have wanted to move in a heartbeat. My husband too, ironically, before we met. But I am what I am and I wouldn&#39;t want to go somewhere I&#39;d be considered a freak lmao more than I kind of am here (being taller than most men..Acadian men are very short, usually 5&#39;4&quot; to 5&#39;9&quot;..my mother was French Canadian and she was MAYBE 4&#39;9&quot;. I still live in a French Canadian province, so they all think I&#39;m European...and I am, but I&#39;m also Acadian lol. That&#39;s a whole other thing, though, my own people don&#39;t accept me because I look foreign).; Muscle girl bar is soooo cool inside.; How do you stay so reasonable on YouTube?; I’m going to Japan in November, my sister and I love  to workout. I’m telling her about that place, she would love to go and we can flex with them!; Asian countries actually need body positivity. They would call someone like Michelle McDaniel too bulky and fat. They have a higher tendency to discourage weight lifting for women as well; OMG the Japanese are getting FAT!!!; I love that you went there. Nobody ever dares to criticize the Japanese. Or Asian in general. Their standards are insane. They pretty much just like children.; I&#39;m now obsessed with Japanese muscle girls. Thanks.; It&#39;s soy and seed oils.. the push of carbs and vegetables over meat. Meat ! Eat all you want and nothing else.  You&#39;ll become a real life super hero.  Promise.; Women don&#39;t have rights over there.; I naturally just walk on my toes and I feel bad for anyone who buys those shoes. Walking the way I do has left me with life-long foot problems and it&#39;s not a fun time.; I live in Japan and I can say, people will outright tell you to your face &quot;You&#39;re FAT!&quot;, no shame,  no excuses, just facts, and people just accept it. If people feel offended, they loose the weight, if not you have no choice but not to care what others think. Societal pressure can work wonders for losing weight. (I am considered fat in Japan at 70kg, 165cm height.); I hate that so many Japanese girls feel the need to change their eyes. I mean, their eyes! How is that ok? Most of them have beautiful eyes.; Michelle, I love your videos and have been watching for several years. I feel like i noticed in several videos that the background music is just a bit too loud and therefor a bit distracting while I’m trying to listen to what you’re saying. Could be that it’s just me, but maybe take that into consideration next time! Thanks for the vid 🎉 and generally your content!; I really enjoyed this video!; It’s the introduction of fast food places.; I absolutely love when you do these types of videos, it was so engaging. I found myself locked onto the screen when I was supposed to be cooking 😅; I thought its because of their low fat diet...; Japan doesn&#39;t eat as much processed food as us, that&#39;s why they are smaller; I’m sorry, but seeing those beautiful muscular women made me tear up. They are GORGEOUS and anyone who says otherwise has AWFUL taste.; Ok I&#39;m a little obsessed w japanese culture now. I need to know more lol; Why Not the middle ? Not too thin Not tooo fat; Please do more videos on Japan 😄 I love your videos; I support body positivity, becose i see it as a tought, that if your body is healthy and you are happy in it, nothing else matters.; I thought you were Canadian?; I think it’s because there’s Litteraly like 0% diversity so they have to knit pick the smallest details in order to differentiate themselves and stand out above the rest; interesting thing about mental health in Japan, bcs everything is about appearances and romanticising things with little effort, there is a sub culture for it called menhera which is cutesy and pastel but u will find the underlying themes of mental illness  (altho is glorifies depressy and SH) bcs of the disturbing idea of it thats their move to gain awareness about it. To find out more, look up menhera chan and its an anime girl with pink twin tails. just study her outfit and design and u will get what i mean; Anyone who does bully people like me for having thyroid could end up getting thyroid. Thyroid can happen to anyone. Men get it. Women get it more (idk why); I’m overweight cause of my thyroid. It’s not my fault and other people’s fault who have the same issue. <br><br>Anyway, we’re all beautiful inside and out. Overweight or not.<br><br>Only ones that are not, are the evil monsters like that creator of iCarly, Amanda Show, and more.; It&#39;s the same in Mexico - Skin Color wise. Dark mean you work outside = labor work. Light skin = Indoor job, which means higher class.; Can we start movement of healthphilia or health positivity, promote it and make trend of it? Promote  regular blood tests. Healthy eating orders including adequate portion sizes, rich in nutrition and vitamins and controlled snacking. Please; The Japanese will allow men to be fat because of Sumo wrestling. Being chubby in women is not really praise worthy but it can be tolerated. However, it&#39;s extremely difficult to find bigger clothing due to most people being small.; Stivia comes from Japan cause they pig out on sweets; I am fat in Japan. I’m in my 50s and my waist is 26 inches; I loved this video. You are amazing.; now I gotta get one of those wonder cores just cuz the commercial; In America they used to say our body our choice. Now we are going back to, It is our body it&#39;s republican&#39;s choice.; That Korean bodybuilder&#39;s reveal was so majestic and glorious! I say HECK YES to any women that want to be strong and feel confident!; well america obesity export so well everywhere even in country like china or japan that used to have almost none of those problem before America send them Mcdonald and starbuck. ^^.; ok officially you’re my favourite on youtube; listen, im straight but when it comes to MUSCULAR WOMEN...; The gal at the beginning of the video in the blue bikini is not sexy (in my opinion) Those breasts look like canonballs and are probably hard as a rock; I’m a black foreigner in Japan. The beauty standards are different for foreigners and especially black women. In terms of general acceptance, unless you’re  significantly obese and older, you’ll have no issues with locals. If you’re looking to date, that’s when issues arise. However, I have several friends  who are married/ in long term relationships with no problem, just a matter of personal preference. City guys are more open than those in the countryside etc.<br><br>I’m definitely a bigger lady (5ft 5, 70kgs) and I dress myself appropriately (no cleavage or body lines shown for work) but don’t try to suit beauty standards, which is the where many gaijin meet their downfall. Trying to meet expectations can have poor results and I’ve seen coworkers bullied by students and staff and stop eating completely just the lose weight. I’ve never had any problems with anyone commenting on my weight (to my face;gossip is rampant here) and I don’t consider myself to be cute but my students do so I guess that’s something. Long story short, unless you’re coming to live in Japan as a muscle mommy, you’ll be fine!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=1210"">20:10</a> Damn bro, best of both worlds, pefect wife hahahah; Ngl those wonder core ads are funny asf XD; As long as they dont put it into the anime I&#39;m fine hahahahha; i wont lie my hair which im growing is looking like their hair; What are they going to do with the Sumo wrestlers?; It’s not unhealthy to be fat, you just need to have a good balance in your body, having too much fat and little muscle is unhealthy and being too skinny is also unhealthy, we just need to have a balance in our body, that doesn’t mean you have to be skinny, you just need balance in your body; Ok so hear me out that one angel group sang super well like that song sounds crazy; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=272"">04:32</a> homegirl here is not Japanese; I wasn&#39;t ready for you to hit me with the muscle mommies omg. 😳😳😳💞💞💞; Japan just wants children not women; I think that in the past the beauty standard in Asia has been unhealthy thin and if you look at the fertility rates in Asia, it mirrors that as women with extremely low body fat typically cannot get pregnant. I forget which study I read this in, but I believe it is true, obviously America is too obese. I wonder what happened to moderation though. A lot of people think that you have to either be really skinny to be healthy or that being fat is healthy and neither is true. I used to be like 90 pounds and I’m so much happier at 115/120, though calorie and sugar moderation is very important. Moderationnnnn is key; Not just in Japan but in most of the south east asian countries the beauty standards are killer and indirectly influenced by the men in those countries. <br>Men in those countries prefer slender and small women because they look more teenager-like and fragile. They prefer such body types because then they have the inner feeling to protect them. A normal healthy woman who weighs around 47-57 kgs doesn&#39;t appeal them because as per the men they can&#39;t be easily pushed around and don&#39;t need much protection. <br>The men prefer totally submissive women to feel socially powerful and that&#39;s why they prefer women whom they can physically control and who will depend on them to protect themselves.; Our American government wants us overweight :/; love the video! but btw quite a few girls are kpop idols and are korean (some of them are japanese members but still); Can you imagine visitubg your therapist and the first question they ask you is: &quot;Why are you fat?&quot;; They just want to Date children; I wish the government got involved in our country&#39;s weight epidemic.; Japan be like : here by the japanese empire declares fat to be a crime…. We dont like fat mans here …..nor little boys.; Ive seen so many japanese girls who are skinny fat or have chubby short legs. I feel like this standard of super skinny is mostly put on idols and tv personalities; Food companies are straight up poisoning  us. Period.; Before I wished I had been born in Japan.. Their disipline, their healthy lifestyle (Good food and long distance to walk whereever you go), the idea of everyone want to be normal and fit in, not trying to be the center of attention, the nicness, tradition and so much more..<br>But been living in Europe all my life Japan would be really hard to live in, and there is some messed up stuff there that I wouldnt agree with at all. But if I was born there, I would have adapted from start.; “I’m dark, loud, opinionated, and muscular” LMAOOO love the energy ❤❤❤; Anime obsessed 10 year old me would have been in for a rude rude awakening if I actually had gotten to go lmao. If I was being visiously bullied in the states at 10 I wouldn&#39;t want to know what people with their standards would have said. 😐; Not me grabbing an apple after watching this 💀; I used to volunteer with the Korean embassy and the Korean exchange center.<br>with similar beauty standards I have noticed something.<br>One of the girls working there was my height and looked to be almost my weight to a bit less , and she calls me pretty . But she brought herself down as well. Other people were typical skinny but on the shorter side, others weighed more with a smaller frame. At first I was worried because I know the culture but after a few months I realized that  :<br><br>1) &quot;Pretty&quot; in Korean society doesn&#39;t always equate to absolutely being rail thin. It is more the overall style and silhouette. In my case I am thin everywhere but below my belly. As long as you dress well and work with what you have rather than put it out there you&#39;ll not receive bad comments. For example, I would go the extra mile to wear high waisted pants, shorts, or dresses that had a large belt in the middle. I never got shamed at all even though I do get shamed from my family on a daily basis so I was expecting the worse.<br><br>2) There is a bit of a  misconception that in general east Asians always eat healthily, Like in this videos , it is more a pattern of starving and fad diets. I used to have lunch with my Korean friends that I came to know at the exchange center during my volunteer days.<br>I am from a Mediterranean country which is super known for having extremely healthy cuisine , yet I saw a lot of fried chicken, snacking on fried seeds, a lot of bread item/sandwiches on breakfast Nutella crepes right after lunch, bags and bags of crisps while watching documentaries at the exchange center, instead of opting for the local healthy substitutes. <br><br><br>I came to think that maybe the obsession with being skinny comes from the availability of unhealthy food and the need to make conscious effort to abstain from them. While here, where I am from, they are not around much due to the fact that they are expensive and most fast food chains don&#39;t operate. Here the priciest items in the supermarket are oil, followed by butter then meats , and the cheapest are fruits  and vegetables.<br>Half a kilo of tomato costs as much as one pack of instant ramen but lasts way longer and you can make many dishes with it.; I’m American and the metabo law is kind of awesome. Idk how it would work without a job but they offer counseling and support. I thought they just locked your voluptuous rump up 😭; I recently moved out of Okinawa Japan to go to America I lived on a smaller island and all the women were very beautiful I am a bigger girl ofc they would always tell me I’m beautiful to but in some stores things were either to big for me or to small for me ALSO CAN I JUST SAY EATING A WHOLE JAPANESE MEAL IS SO HARD TO DO😭 <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=1208"">20:08</a>  also im gay as hell and would let this woman step on me; I LOVE these kinds of bodies on different cultures videos. I would be interested in Malaysia, which I believe is the most overweight country in south east Asia. Just an idea! I lived in Thailand for a few years and they are starting to have weight problems as well.; Of my job offered me therapy for my issues and over eating, I&#39;d do it! I finally got health insurance and my first appointment is coming up, whoops whoop!; Omg I do the nose exercises! They totally work, kind of crazy; I had a bout of depression that caused me to not eat much, i was consuming maybe 800-1000 calories a day and it only took about 6 weeks for this to fuck with my period. Imagine the women in these asian countries, who are doing <b>worse</b> than that. I quickly started eating again as i should and things are fine now. But yeesh, they already have suffering birth rates due to a variety of avoidable reasons, and beauty standards  on top of it? How can a place so innovative, clean, efficient and functional like Japan be struggling still with.. well frankly, stupid ass shit like this and overworking? Theyre being so, so unkind to themselves as a whole nation.; @michellemed543 I saw this and wondered what you thought of her opinion😕🤥😮‍💨🤔🤔<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABt-qxp0itM"">https://youtu.be/ABt-qxp0itM?si=a_Q71rzrsYqCcWO_</a>; I wanna go to the muscle girl bar so bad T_T; Am I the only one who finds it disturbing that so many cultures are trying to make their women look like little children?; I’m so happy I found your channel!<br><br>I’m actually quarter japanese and do not fit the standard, growing up and visiting japan with my pure japanese gramma was a nightmare for me!; I am half Japanese and for my whole life I&#39;ve been hearing stuff about my weight, my muscles my skin colour, etc... In theory I should fit the beauty standard for skin colour but I tan so easily that if I go to japan in summer I always get comments from my family about how I have dirty skin. I never understood this as I grew up in a very multicultural environment and because I was taught to love myself no matter what people think of me. That brings me to my next point, <br><br>When I went to school in japan I was shocked at how skinny they all were. I am the average weight for my age (for where I live) but I heard whispers of &quot;omg she&#39;s so chubby&quot; as I walked the school hallways. And god, that hurt my feelings, because I always thought I was healthy and the normal weight. It was really a blow to my self esteem but in the end, I came back to my home country and I mostly forgot about it... Until I watched this video lol<br><br>That was a really long comment lmao, I&#39;m so sorry but ngl I needed that rant; hey have you watched Demon Slayer? if not, you really should! it is a great show, 10/10 I highly recommend! oh and i subscribed too 😎💪🏻; The people who mock my size the most is my family and i just sit their like how do you expect me to take that like what do you say when people mick you for being skinny and praised for being small by others.

Japanese culture food in San Antonio. I saw that you had checked your weights machine. 🤔 I need to look up what that means. Do they charge you more if you weigh a lot?; I love your channel you are so real; I really don’t think it’s fair to talk so &quot;neutrally“ about the demand to stay thin as a Japanese company employee. These people stay at work from morning to late evening. Most of them commute at least an hour to work. It’s nearly impossible to eat healthy as a company worker – unless you have a wife that cooks you all your meals. No sleep, constant stress – plus  mandatory drinking outings with the boss – make it nearly impossible to stay &quot;thin&quot; without starving. It’s honestly pretty unfair to demand staying out until midnight while also expecting magical health from your employees (although lbr health doesn’t matter in Japan either, only self-control and suppressing your weaknesses).<br><br>And yeah please do not forget the Japanese standard for thinness is paper-thin. Seeing Japanese people in Japan versus in Europe is absolutely mind-boggling.; LOLOLOL! The Korean variety show clip! I saw that when it aired and laughed my ass off. The best was when the male idols started to taunt each other about how she&#39;d break them because she was far more powerful.

I&#39;m an ex anorexic. I arrived thin, was called &quot;beautiful&quot;, discovered weight training here, and progressively built a strong body that people said looked &quot;cool&quot; (but not &quot;beautiful&quot; anymore). Then I had fertility treatments and stopped exercising, got pregnant twice on a row which left me with a curvy body with a BMI of 24. So yeah, not so &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; anymore. Everybody was making fun of how fat I got. My boss, who I also considered a friend, called me a &quot;sumo&quot;, a &quot;pig&quot;, an &quot;obese&quot;. My ob-gyn told me at every appointment that I was approaching obesity (I only gained 8kg in pregnancy...). It was really unnerving because I knew I could lose weight easily, and I planned on losing weight after giving birth anyway. But their remarks really made me fall back towards anorexia. I lost 20kg in 4 months, going down to a 18.5 BMI, basically only eating 800 calories a day for 4 months and working my soul out at the gym. And then, the magic happened: &quot;wow Sara, you got so beautiful!&quot; &quot;how did you lose weight? What&#39;s your secret?&quot;. They were expecting me to give them a magical recipe because in their head it&#39;s impossible an &quot;ex-fat&quot; person has the determination to lose weight through effort and pain. I answered: &quot;I stopped eating. I was almost anorexic thanks to all the pressure I received from everyone around me&quot; and everybody suddenly lost interest. 😅; Remember we only get this far because we hog down on poison. Every fat Japanese person I know, eats healthy meals, and then has either larger portions or one or two snacks for 200-600 excess calories a day.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> she&#39;s not even Japanese, she&#39;s Korean 😭; Oh No!

Tan = poor, pale = rich.; Michelle! you have a very important voice. this video encompasses WHY I love your content. Don&#39;t stop. This sh*t is important right now. And you&#39;re being honest and doing your job. Thank you!; Balance. Life is about balance. Too far in either direction is no bueno. Everyone has a different baseline sure, but our bodies know what is “our healthy normal” and always strives for that through homeostasis. We mess us the process interjecting. I used to be an emotional eater. Once I picked up a different hobby to do when I was upset? I stopped being a chunker. Period. Got my arse moving and it melted off.  Added a lil weight resistance and toned it all up. It’s not hard, but it’s hard to START.  Music was my motivation. Since I knew my habits were tied to my emotions I got a gym membership and every time I was triggered emotionally I would have my angsty playlist and gym clothes ready. Instead of taking it out on my body, I took it out of my body with sweat. Never felt better than after those workouts. 💯; ‼️‼️IMPORTANT: pan xiaoting is NOT dead.

Not too thin Not tooo fat; Please do more videos on Japan 😄 I love your videos; I support body positivity, becose i see it as a tought, that if your body is healthy and you are happy in it, nothing else matters.; I thought you were Canadian?; I think it’s because there’s Litteraly like 0% diversity so they have to knit pick the smallest details in order to differentiate themselves and stand out above the rest; interesting thing about mental health in Japan, bcs everything is about appearances and romanticising things with little effort, there is a sub culture for it called menhera which is cutesy and pastel but u will find the underlying themes of mental illness  (altho is glorifies depressy and SH) bcs of the disturbing idea of it thats their move to gain awareness about it. To find out more, look up menhera chan and its an anime girl with pink twin tails. just study her outfit and design and u will get what i mean; Anyone who does bully people like me for having thyroid could end up getting thyroid. Thyroid can happen to anyone. Men get it. Women get it more (idk why); I’m overweight cause of my thyroid. It’s not my fault and other people’s fault who have the same issue. <br><br>Anyway, we’re all beautiful inside and out. Overweight or not.<br><br>Only ones that are not, are the evil monsters like that creator of iCarly, Amanda Show, and more.; It&#39;s the same in Mexico - Skin Color wise. Dark mean you work outside = labor work. Light skin = Indoor job, which means higher class.; Can we start movement of healthphilia or health positivity, promote it and make trend of it? Promote  regular blood tests. Healthy eating orders including adequate portion sizes, rich in nutrition and vitamins and controlled snacking. Please; The Japanese will allow men to be fat because of Sumo wrestling. Being chubby in women is not really praise worthy but it can be tolerated. However, it&#39;s extremely difficult to find bigger clothing due to most people being small.; Stivia comes from Japan cause they pig out on sweets; I am fat in Japan. I’m in my 50s and my waist is 26 inches; I loved this video. You are amazing.; now I gotta get one of those wonder cores just cuz the commercial; In America they used to say our body our choice. Now we are going back to, It is our body it&#39;s republican&#39;s choice.; That Korean bodybuilder&#39;s reveal was so majestic and glorious! I say HECK YES to any women that want to be strong and feel confident!; well america obesity export so well everywhere even in country like china or japan that used to have almost none of those problem before America send them Mcdonald and starbuck. ^^.; ok officially you’re my favourite on youtube; listen, im straight but when it comes to MUSCULAR WOMEN...; The gal at the beginning of the video in the blue bikini is not sexy (in my opinion) Those breasts look like canonballs and are probably hard as a rock; I’m a black foreigner in Japan. The beauty standards are different for foreigners and especially black women. In terms of general acceptance, unless you’re  significantly obese and older, you’ll have no issues with locals. If you’re looking to date, that’s when issues arise. However, I have several friends  who are married/ in long term relationships with no problem, just a matter of personal preference. City guys are more open than those in the countryside etc.<br><br>I’m definitely a bigger lady (5ft 5, 70kgs) and I dress myself appropriately (no cleavage or body lines shown for work) but don’t try to suit beauty standards, which is the where many gaijin meet their downfall. Trying to meet expectations can have poor results and I’ve seen coworkers bullied by students and staff and stop eating completely just the lose weight. I’ve never had any problems with anyone commenting on my weight (to my face;gossip is rampant here) and I don’t consider myself to be cute but my students do so I guess that’s something. Long story short, unless you’re coming to live in Japan as a muscle mommy, you’ll be fine!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=1210"">20:10</a> Damn bro, best of both worlds, pefect wife hahahah; Ngl those wonder core ads are funny asf XD; As long as they dont put it into the anime I&#39;m fine hahahahha; i wont lie my hair which im growing is looking like their hair; What are they going to do with the Sumo wrestlers?; It’s not unhealthy to be fat, you just need to have a good balance in your body, having too much fat and little muscle is unhealthy and being too skinny is also unhealthy, we just need to have a balance in our body, that doesn’t mean you have to be skinny, you just need balance in your body; Ok so hear me out that one angel group sang super well like that song sounds crazy; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=272"">04:32</a> homegirl here is not Japanese; I wasn&#39;t ready for you to hit me with the muscle mommies omg. 😳😳😳💞💞💞; Japan just wants children not women; I think that in the past the beauty standard in Asia has been unhealthy thin and if you look at the fertility rates in Asia, it mirrors that as women with extremely low body fat typically cannot get pregnant. I forget which study I read this in, but I believe it is true, obviously America is too obese. I wonder what happened to moderation though. A lot of people think that you have to either be really skinny to be healthy or that being fat is healthy and neither is true. I used to be like 90 pounds and I’m so much happier at 115/120, though calorie and sugar moderation is very important. Moderationnnnn is key; Not just in Japan but in most of the south east asian countries the beauty standards are killer and indirectly influenced by the men in those countries. <br>Men in those countries prefer slender and small women because they look more teenager-like and fragile. They prefer such body types because then they have the inner feeling to protect them. A normal healthy woman who weighs around 47-57 kgs doesn&#39;t appeal them because as per the men they can&#39;t be easily pushed around and don&#39;t need much protection. <br>The men prefer totally submissive women to feel socially powerful and that&#39;s why they prefer women whom they can physically control and who will depend on them to protect themselves.; Our American government wants us overweight :/; love the video! but btw quite a few girls are kpop idols and are korean (some of them are japanese members but still); Can you imagine visitubg your therapist and the first question they ask you is: &quot;Why are you fat?&quot;; They just want to Date children; I wish the government got involved in our country&#39;s weight epidemic.; Japan be like : here by the japanese empire declares fat to be a crime…. We dont like fat mans here …..nor little boys.; Ive seen so many japanese girls who are skinny fat or have chubby short legs. I feel like this standard of super skinny is mostly put on idols and tv personalities; Food companies are straight up poisoning  us. Period.; Before I wished I had been born in Japan.. Their disipline, their healthy lifestyle (Good food and long distance to walk whereever you go), the idea of everyone want to be normal and fit in, not trying to be the center of attention, the nicness, tradition and so much more..<br>But been living in Europe all my life Japan would be really hard to live in, and there is some messed up stuff there that I wouldnt agree with at all. But if I was born there, I would have adapted from start.; “I’m dark, loud, opinionated, and muscular” LMAOOO love the energy ❤❤❤; Anime obsessed 10 year old me would have been in for a rude rude awakening if I actually had gotten to go lmao. If I was being visiously bullied in the states at 10 I wouldn&#39;t want to know what people with their standards would have said. 😐; Not me grabbing an apple after watching this 💀; I used to volunteer with the Korean embassy and the Korean exchange center.<br>with similar beauty standards I have noticed something.<br>One of the girls working there was my height and looked to be almost my weight to a bit less , and she calls me pretty . But she brought herself down as well. Other people were typical skinny but on the shorter side, others weighed more with a smaller frame. At first I was worried because I know the culture but after a few months I realized that  :<br><br>1) &quot;Pretty&quot; in Korean society doesn&#39;t always equate to absolutely being rail thin. It is more the overall style and silhouette. In my case I am thin everywhere but below my belly. As long as you dress well and work with what you have rather than put it out there you&#39;ll not receive bad comments. For example, I would go the extra mile to wear high waisted pants, shorts, or dresses that had a large belt in the middle. I never got shamed at all even though I do get shamed from my family on a daily basis so I was expecting the worse.<br><br>2) There is a bit of a  misconception that in general east Asians always eat healthily, Like in this videos , it is more a pattern of starving and fad diets. I used to have lunch with my Korean friends that I came to know at the exchange center during my volunteer days.<br>I am from a Mediterranean country which is super known for having extremely healthy cuisine , yet I saw a lot of fried chicken, snacking on fried seeds, a lot of bread item/sandwiches on breakfast Nutella crepes right after lunch, bags and bags of crisps while watching documentaries at the exchange center, instead of opting for the local healthy substitutes. <br><br><br>I came to think that maybe the obsession with being skinny comes from the availability of unhealthy food and the need to make conscious effort to abstain from them. While here, where I am from, they are not around much due to the fact that they are expensive and most fast food chains don&#39;t operate. Here the priciest items in the supermarket are oil, followed by butter then meats , and the cheapest are fruits  and vegetables.<br>Half a kilo of tomato costs as much as one pack of instant ramen but lasts way longer and you can make many dishes with it.; I’m American and the metabo law is kind of awesome. Idk how it would work without a job but they offer counseling and support. I thought they just locked your voluptuous rump up 😭; I recently moved out of Okinawa Japan to go to America I lived on a smaller island and all the women were very beautiful I am a bigger girl ofc they would always tell me I’m beautiful to but in some stores things were either to big for me or to small for me ALSO CAN I JUST SAY EATING A WHOLE JAPANESE MEAL IS SO HARD TO DO😭 <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=1208"">20:08</a>  also im gay as hell and would let this woman step on me; I LOVE these kinds of bodies on different cultures videos. I would be interested in Malaysia, which I believe is the most overweight country in south east Asia. Just an idea! I lived in Thailand for a few years and they are starting to have weight problems as well.; Of my job offered me therapy for my issues and over eating, I&#39;d do it! I finally got health insurance and my first appointment is coming up, whoops whoop!; Omg I do the nose exercises! They totally work, kind of crazy; I had a bout of depression that caused me to not eat much, i was consuming maybe 800-1000 calories a day and it only took about 6 weeks for this to fuck with my period. Imagine the women in these asian countries, who are doing <b>worse</b> than that. I quickly started eating again as i should and things are fine now. But yeesh, they already have suffering birth rates due to a variety of avoidable reasons, and beauty standards  on top of it? How can a place so innovative, clean, efficient and functional like Japan be struggling still with.. well frankly, stupid ass shit like this and overworking? Theyre being so, so unkind to themselves as a whole nation.; @michellemed543 I saw this and wondered what you thought of her opinion😕🤥😮‍💨🤔🤔<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABt-qxp0itM"">https://youtu.be/ABt-qxp0itM?si=a_Q71rzrsYqCcWO_</a>; I wanna go to the muscle girl bar so bad T_T; Am I the only one who finds it disturbing that so many cultures are trying to make their women look like little children?; I’m so happy I found your channel!<br><br>I’m actually quarter japanese and do not fit the standard, growing up and visiting japan with my pure japanese gramma was a nightmare for me!; I am half Japanese and for my whole life I&#39;ve been hearing stuff about my weight, my muscles my skin colour, etc... In theory I should fit the beauty standard for skin colour but I tan so easily that if I go to japan in summer I always get comments from my family about how I have dirty skin. I never understood this as I grew up in a very multicultural environment and because I was taught to love myself no matter what people think of me. That brings me to my next point, <br><br>When I went to school in japan I was shocked at how skinny they all were. I am the average weight for my age (for where I live) but I heard whispers of &quot;omg she&#39;s so chubby&quot; as I walked the school hallways. And god, that hurt my feelings, because I always thought I was healthy and the normal weight. It was really a blow to my self esteem but in the end, I came back to my home country and I mostly forgot about it... Until I watched this video lol<br><br>That was a really long comment lmao, I&#39;m so sorry but ngl I needed that rant; hey have you watched Demon Slayer? if not, you really should! it is a great show, 10/10 I highly recommend! oh and i subscribed too 😎💪🏻; The people who mock my size the most is my family and i just sit their like how do you expect me to take that like what do you say when people mick you for being skinny and praised for being small by others. Stressful af.; Ik its unnecessary but the girl at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclhXnR79uY&amp;t=825"">13:45</a> isn&#39;t japanese she a very famous kpop solo idol IU <br>Speaking of which <br>Please do a video on strict korean beauty standards; I remember going out eating at a restaurant. Japanese culture food in San Antonio. I saw that you had checked your weights machine. 🤔 I need to look up what that means. Do they charge you more if you weigh a lot?; I love your channel you are so real; I really don’t think it’s fair to talk so &quot;neutrally“ about the demand to stay thin as a Japanese company employee. These people stay at work from morning to late evening. Most of them commute at least an hour to work. It’s nearly impossible to eat healthy as a company worker – unless you have a wife that cooks you all your meals. No sleep, constant stress – plus  mandatory drinking outings with the boss – make it nearly impossible to stay &quot;thin&quot; without starving. It’s honestly pretty unfair to demand staying out until midnight while also expecting magical health from your employees (although lbr health doesn’t matter in Japan either, only self-control and suppressing your weaknesses).<br><br>And yeah please do not forget the Japanese standard for thinness is paper-thin. Seeing Japanese people in Japan versus in Europe is absolutely mind-boggling.; LOLOLOL! The Korean variety show clip! I saw that when it aired and laughed my ass off. The best was when the male idols started to taunt each other about how she&#39;d break them because she was far more powerful. It was glorious. 🤣💖🫰; We need more muscle girls.; Could you please do a video about the exercises in Japan.

I don&#39;t even do pictures, don&#39;t post them online. at one point I realized I had to establish a routine of looking at myself in the mirror because I avoided it, subconsciously even, so much that I was missing major health changes. and I&#39;m an older millennial.; In my opinion, this is your best video. Thank you. Who are we trying to look like and why?; Thank you for your videos I appreciate your integrity!!!; Gary, you have most beautiful skin…; How is using filters useful in real life? If you only interact online, they are fine, but if you are going to ever meet someone in real life, the people you meet will end up being very disappointed.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1283"">21:23</a> <br><br>When I&#39;m drunk every woman looks like a model and when i wake up?

Given the state of the world right now,, it&#39;s not out of the question that someone gets the idea to sabotage those undersea internet cables. Then what? Complete society meltdown? We generally hail technology changes as making us better, but I think it makes people a lot more vulnerable. I love the web, and the way I can get anwers to all my questions about all sorts. However, the effects of interwebs are showing in the mental health stats. We have created a world we are not evolved enough to live in.   I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if our worries become a whole lot greater than the way we want to look.; No risk of complications from surgeries but guaranteed emotional damage when they have to show up in person and people see their real face and body. lol.; I know that people with money would pay anything to look youthful. But nothing lasts forever, even plastic surgeries. I have met some people who have learned how to age gracefully. They carry their wrinkles like a badge of courage and wisdom. I think people who use filters suffer from low self-esteem. People will love you for yourself if you accept your flaws and all. No one is truly perfect.; The psychology of photoshopping,face tuning,filters etc don&#39;t show a growth or basis of healthy self esteem. I think AI is making things far worse and will literally keep people isolated and dissasociated from real life. It&#39;s not just fun and fantasy,it&#39;s about online clout no matter how fraudulent. We&#39;ve all seen the gotcha photos of KK on the beach without her paparazzi and that massive diaper butt on spindly legs,yet to insecure women and girls she was the launch of a thousand plus BBLs. I&#39;m not against cosmetics and/or plastic surgery for alittle self improvement,to prolong good looks in the public eye ie actors,politicians etc or to correct something that has effected self esteem because of how people treated them. Alittle nip and tuck to raise the spirits. But the online transformations are over the top and will lead a person to nowhere that&#39;s based on a healthy foundation of the self. How can you leave the house to meet someone and have a real life if you have made yourself look like a Prince or Princess but in reality look like a potato?

I hate people that think they know what they are talking about!; I’m 75 and I don’t have the money to have plastic surgery so the only thing I can do is eat healthy, do intermittent fasting half the month, exercise every day and meditate! So far it has helped me to stay in shape and look and act a lot younger than I am even though my skin is getting wrinkly but it’s the way you present yourself that’s counteracting age!; Thanks Doc Gary Linkov. I came for your voice 😊 it somehow calm my soul ❤.; Mind, body and soul. Glad the guy mentioned the importance and emphasized on how the body needs to also match the face. I use to tell my ex “a girl<br>Could always change her body, but not her face” about being plastic surgery free and he def agreed w me.; Why did all your hair fall out again?; I remember over 40 years ago in school  our class watching a video on robots. It showed the synthetic skin and how they talked and moved. I remember the last statement of that movie. The statement was pretty soon you won&#39;t know who&#39;s real and who&#39;s a robot. That really stuck in my head and now to hear these same words over 40 years later and seeing the reality of it is amazing!😊; China is really bad for this!   Just horrid!   One of the reasons why is because of the former one child policy when everyone only wanted boys.   There is no longer enough females to match the men.  So....the men have little choice but to look at fake AI girls, and other kinds of fakelike &#39;&#39;girls&#39;&#39;   :O; I don’t get the following after he revealed it’s Ai, it’s nuts, yeah Japanese culture is kind of strange that way.

Look at the outline around his shiny head, focus on his forehead and you’ll see it come on and off…; My ex-roommate looked like a typical, standard Disney princess. She showed me a video of her as Belle, dancing and singing inside of the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. It was so perfect that there was NO evidence that it was faked. Even her singing voice, which is close to perfect and I&#39;ve heard in person, was a perfect match. This was three years ago. I just figured that AI had already gotten that good. Now I&#39;m beginning to suspect that she actually did do an actual screen test. Either that or one of her many simpy worshippers was a computer geek/ master video editor and painstakingly inserted and synced her into the video frame by frame. Otherwise, being an actual actress could have been another one of her secrets, which wouldn&#39;t be out of character for her. Woman of ten thousand secrets. Like her side gig as a chameleon WSOP champion, and stunning 43 yr old virgin who looked 23 at the same time.; There&#39;s another example. A very wealthy Chinese man couldn&#39;t understand why his children looked ugly when his wife looked beautiful. It appeared she had extensive plastic surgery, changing her in a completely different person.

So everyone in that universe looked like any of the 12 model beauty types, like an avatar in real life. No one of was unique. When I saw it about 20 years ago I didn’t think it would happen so soon.; I can’t imagine what young girls have to go thru now. I feel like in 50 to 100 years we’ll look like a completely different species.; I blame the Kardashians for this heavy reliance on changing into plastic doll ratios. Aging or not it has caused some body dysmorphia with many young women who follow them or their influence on society.; I don’t use any filters.

I will say that in Chinese society, filters are used with a sense of humor. People are not afraid to show that they are not their makeup or their filters. Just look at the recent &quot;transformation&quot; trend on Douyin. People show what they look like before, and then transition to their full-glam self. Yes, there are people who want to look like AI in real life with plastic surgery, but they are still far and few; Did you do an update on your hair-back process? was it only partly successful? Please let us know if there&#39;s a video on it.; The only cosmetic surgery I’d consider is a small facelift, nothing radical or not that stretched tight look.  I’d have the scars from the surgery for the necrotic brown recluse bite and resulting severe cellulitis.  It left noticeable scars on my chin and the entire left side of my face.  It makes me look older than my actual age.  When it happened the crummy insurance would not cover the cost of what they deemed elective, not restorative surgery.  Seriously, marks on a woman’s face that’s noticeable does affect the confidence.  Although I don’t look like I belong on the Munsters, it is enough that I’ve been turned down for jobs where I’d be the first one the public would see, even if I was otherwise the most qualified.; Ive really started to age late 30s; thumbnail kinda misleading and has nothing to do with beauty standards. the story behind it is that it&#39;s an old guy who really likes motorcycles and just posts pics of himself with a girl filter to get more people into motorcycles. as far as i know, he hasn&#39;t had any cosmetic surgeries. whang! has a vid on it; The line is: do what makes you happy.

We need more face to face contact , not social media ?; I own every sag and wrinkle I&#39;ve earned. I spend my money on food.; This is so wrong! Unless you&#39;re a robot. Or an ai. Or a human transfer in to a computer. That&#39;s the line!; I love Edvasian…; I never used a filter on any of my pictures or videos. What you see is what you get. I am 60 and the first time of my life I was thinking about botox. I know i will never get them its just a thought. But I really think its wrong about those AI stuff and I have to agree with you that this is not mentally healthy. It is getting worse not better. Look at those kids were go to sephora and buy anti aging cream with 10 years old and the parents allow it. By the time they are 20 they will need plastic surgery. So you guys will be very busy soon. 😊; Those plain women at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1099"">18:19</a> look fine to me.; The world is getting crazier and crazier; IM SORRY WTF IS WRONG WITH THAT THUMBNAIL. WHO ARE YOU TO SHAME OTHERS, YOU UG….UMMM. Before you make any other more videos, just ask yourself:<br> is it nice. <br>That’s all you gotta ask. Is it a nice thing to do to another human being, not just one, but many strangers that could identify with  the shame that you’re throwing at them , do you ever stop and Imagine you are the person that you’re calling out that is “out of control “ think how they’re going to feel and react when they watch what you made?  that’s all you should ask yourself. <br><br>As far as I’m aware of there isn’t a tragedy of widespread death and plastic surgery, talking about delicate, every person is different,   About medicine and supporting self-esteem and something that is the patients choice. A procedure that is probably very difficult and they have thought long and hard to do. <br><br>How about this.. I really was not going to make a nice comment in the beginning, but let’s follow this a little farther<br>.. How about if I did a thumbnail of your picture with the description:“This guy thinks he’s OK looking and breed worthy apparently, because he can be the arbiter of what people should, should not look like, thumbnail title with a picture of you and the other person:“ I AM the beauty standard! therefore, these people are not!, let me tell you why!”. , would you like to see your face &amp; that quote in your feed?? How would you like that? . I would be completely accurate. I would make assumptions reasonable by what you had said.  I <br><br>I’m not gonna tell you what you should do with this video. You should know yourself . <br><br>There could be insults from all over the world, that could be directed to the people that you discuss,  could occur  on public discourse I.e. Twitter, etc. because of your video and people have killed themselves from much less ..with just a few comments in a public town written bulletin, Board or high school discourse or church supper. That person in your video could receive hundreds a day of Shame. It is people like you that have gotten out of control thinking that people need to hear what you say. It doesn’t make the world a better place, then why why with everything that’s going on do you have to do it, can you find a different way of making money?; I thought I was watching Keanu Reeves, and it was not him. So, I un-subscribed. Speaking of hair implants. I was thinking about Richard Simmons and Trump and remembering Simmons and wondering why Trump I think hasn&#39;t had hair implants. Simmons did it, I think, in his 30s after going bald from that disease that makes hair fall out.; Glad Im a plain approaching middle aged man; This Edv guy is quite racist towards White people so please don&#39;t promote him; Getting old is the most natural part of life, but we have been made to belive that we should fight the aging process.; I think we all turn into the general mold because we will soon be all AI robots who look the same. It is all about making people get used to it become accepting of the next step in human evolution.; Most refreshing display of ethical medical  professionnalism. Kudos!; If the double standard didn&#39;t exist there would be 1/4 of the current plastic surgeons.; Are you following the detransitioners lawsuits in the USA?<br>There is a young man in the UK harmed by gender ideology who is suing the NHS, his lawyers are doing it without fees upfront and they are  a major famous law firm.<br><br>This is the biggest medical scandal of our generation. <br><br>Italy are pro secuting doctors over puberty stopping drugs.<br><br>Not to mention the many cases of assaults on women and children by men pretending to be women in hospitals toilets and changing rooms. As the mother of a young daughter it makes me sick.; I think as a (bald) James McAvoy look-a-like you’ll probably find aspects of this bizarre or unrelatable, many people aren’t blessed with natural good looks, so if it makes them feel better mentally I’m all for AI enhancement.; i want look completely different, HATE my &quot;face&quot; its unbearable for me 🙈🤢🤮😒😡☠💀; 🤔…The thumbnail photo is clickbait to lure people into the actual video.; i am 22, and i wanna do face lift next year to look 8 years old, i&#39;m doing this to get my ex teacher&#39;s attention, i missed the opportunity before, he likes kids; Back in the day when one could only create a cartoon avatar of oneself with limited template options, I did one for myself based on hair color, eye color, ethnicity and posted it on my social media since I did not want to show my real identity. It was seriously weird the guys who followed this cartoon avatar asking to be &quot;friends&quot;. I am like guys this is a cartoon you are looking at. So I took it down because it just weirded me out. But there must be some desperately lonely people out there.; Below the neck ages, so yes you have to consider that we start looking frailer as we age, and or the body skin ages and sags. They are starting to use AI models I think online for ads, and selling of lingerie for example.  The women are just too perfect to be real.   Here they show some AI women and you would not know,.   A bit of filter is not terrible to blur the face a tad, and it does look like many esp women are doing it, along with lighting. People are on camera due to SM longer and imperfections stand out on modern cameras, so helping oneself a bit is ok but not too much.; I entered 40 recently and I realized i was blind when I was younger thinking that I’m ugly! Bc I didn’t love myself until Jesus saved me and started to heal my soul ❤️‍🩹 and delivered from lies. And now I just want to be like me again when I was younger and look nice ❤<br>By the way dr. Your skin is beautiful 🤍 and thank you for the discussion <br>God bless you; You don’t need a filter.; Scary!; Eventually we we all end up looking like 👽; Anyone remember the movie called Surrogates? It reminds me of this; Asian kid is annoying.; You forgot to tell about people like me, who got in a car accident and my face changed after that. I really hoped and prayed for my face to be back to normal after what happened. I couldn&#39;t even smile for 6 months. But after antibiotics , long therapy and a little scar removals it&#39;s all good now. I&#39;m happy 👾. But back into that time it was really scary how I looked. It really has affected me mentally.; How much of this is a fear of dying, an attempt to stop the inevitable? At some point your body starts breaking down and  you&#39;re still trying to look twenty years younger.. What does that say about how you feel about your ethnicity when you no longer look like anyone in your family? I have my father&#39;s bump on my nose showing my Italian heritage and I would never change that.; I think people should just assume anyone online is using all available tools to look their best including not really existing lol. Also the line for me is looking unnatural/ like I&#39;m not myself. But the line for everyone else should be what makes them happy/surgeon agrees is safe etc.; That girl at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1189"">19:49</a> doesn&#39;t look human. Thanks for linking to the original video.; I feel bad for the women who&#39;ve had bad nose jobs and have to live with them. There are so many of them out there. Do they know their noses look awful or do they think they look OK?  It seems just a tweak is very hard to get right, and then there is the passage of time where things may go awry.; In my late forties I grew a beard to hide my jowl progression. I can cope with my sagging eyelids and excessive hair on my body. I like looking a natural 60.<br>My beard has turned grey, my hair and eyebrows are naturally mid/light brown still.<br>I like my look. <br>We need to stop being so Vain. It&#39;s fine to age....just be graceful when doing so.; Human sims; My daughter is like Elizabeth Taylor ... born beautiful.<br>Beauty has a dark side I never knew about until my daughter came along. <br><br>Elementary school kids would tell her, &quot;You should be a model!&quot; and the next day, they gang up as a group and bully her. Her supposed best friend slapped her out of nowhere, and she forgave her. Then they became teenagers and suddenly, all the boys paid all the attention to my daughter, but her friends became jealous and wanted to &quot;curb stomp&quot; my child.  You wind up a very lonely girl. So, she aimed to please these &quot;friends&quot;, and they used her (money, car, etc.). But then, yet another queen of jealousy got on the internet and bullied her some more, saying such hurtful things, I wanted to call the FBI and report her for internet bullying. And, all these supposed &quot;friends&quot; joined in the bullying again! Finally, high school is over! Ya think it&#39;s over? Nah! 50 year old women at work began doing the same thing! <br><br>Men? Nearly all of them want to bed her. Even a teacher stalked her. We&#39;d go to a restaurant and the waitress hands her a note with a phone number from a man sitting somewhere in the restaurant inviting her to call him. Other times, we&#39;d find notes on our car. She&#39;d get harassed at work by some dude  who couldn&#39;t take no for an answer. <br><br>As her mother, I&#39;m appalled and fearful for her.; I LOVE Edvasian and Dr. Linkov.

People will do anything to get views, likes and approval. All thanks to crappy social media. I guess you can&#39;t stop it&#39;s but there&#39;s going to be a lot of mentally tortured people in the future. Thank God He keeps me sane ❤; I used to have a flat nose that went across half my face and everybody would ask me if I was albino... Used to have a really fat wide face and wide jaw... Aging has caused my face to sag a little bit which has given me more of a  oval face with v-jaw... My nose is no longer flat and half of my face... Age has absolutely changed my face and honestly I like it better; Hahahahahahahahah 😂😂😂; Then there&#39;s fat transfer. Ugh.Soon, We might get to look the way we want to. It will be scary, but I can see it coming. This will be horrible if someone has BDD and keeps changing. Mehan Fox looks too different these days. Ugh. Too much! TOO MUCH; I had to get a new ID when I cut my hair and dyed it.  I couldn&#39;t get into bars because no one believed it was me!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1130"">18:50</a>.

I cant inagine trying to navigate it all and dealing with the environment that dating has become...no thank you!!; I’ve never had a desire to meet anyone online.<br>If do not make someone’s acquaintance in person, not interested.; All the more reason to get off social media, especially when it comes to dating.  Guys don’t want to date anyway. They want to get laid.; Dishonesty is never cool with me. Though prejudice is also not cool with me based on looks. I guess we are people nowadays who are ethically challenged. So I guess it&#39;s not so much a case of you lied to me but why did you lie to me.; I don&#39;t buy the &quot;if it makes you feel more confident, then do it.&quot; No, go to the gym. Go to therapy. Go meditate. Go cultivate some self-awareness. Go do something with your life that doesn&#39;t revolve around your looks. Learn to just accept your lot in life. Work with what you have.

I don&#39;t even do pictures, don&#39;t post them online. at one point I realized I had to establish a routine of looking at myself in the mirror because I avoided it, subconsciously even, so much that I was missing major health changes. and I&#39;m an older millennial.; In my opinion, this is your best video.

Given the state of the world right now,, it&#39;s not out of the question that someone gets the idea to sabotage those undersea internet cables. Then what? Complete society meltdown? We generally hail technology changes as making us better, but I think it makes people a lot more vulnerable. I love the web, and the way I can get anwers to all my questions about all sorts. However, the effects of interwebs are showing in the mental health stats. We have created a world we are not evolved enough to live in.

But nothing lasts forever, even plastic surgeries. I have met some people who have learned how to age gracefully. They carry their wrinkles like a badge of courage and wisdom. I think people who use filters suffer from low self-esteem. People will love you for yourself if you accept your flaws and all. No one is truly perfect.; The psychology of photoshopping,face tuning,filters etc don&#39;t show a growth or basis of healthy self esteem. I think AI is making things far worse and will literally keep people isolated and dissasociated from real life. It&#39;s not just fun and fantasy,it&#39;s about online clout no matter how fraudulent. We&#39;ve all seen the gotcha photos of KK on the beach without her paparazzi and that massive diaper butt on spindly legs,yet to insecure women and girls she was the launch of a thousand plus BBLs.

Please let us know if there&#39;s a video on it.; The only cosmetic surgery I’d consider is a small facelift, nothing radical or not that stretched tight look.  I’d have the scars from the surgery for the necrotic brown recluse bite and resulting severe cellulitis.  It left noticeable scars on my chin and the entire left side of my face.  It makes me look older than my actual age.  When it happened the crummy insurance would not cover the cost of what they deemed elective, not restorative surgery.  Seriously, marks on a woman’s face that’s noticeable does affect the confidence.  Although I don’t look like I belong on the Munsters, it is enough that I’ve been turned down for jobs where I’d be the first one the public would see, even if I was otherwise the most qualified.; Ive really started to age late 30s; thumbnail kinda misleading and has nothing to do with beauty standards. the story behind it is that it&#39;s an old guy who really likes motorcycles and just posts pics of himself with a girl filter to get more people into motorcycles. as far as i know, he hasn&#39;t had any cosmetic surgeries. whang! has a vid on it; The line is: do what makes you happy. The world is cruel; you&#39;re damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t.; Interpersonal communications will solve this.  We need more face to face contact , not social media ?; I own every sag and wrinkle I&#39;ve earned. I spend my money on food.; This is so wrong! Unless you&#39;re a robot. Or an ai. Or a human transfer in to a computer. That&#39;s the line!; I love Edvasian…; I never used a filter on any of my pictures or videos. What you see is what you get. I am 60 and the first time of my life I was thinking about botox. I know i will never get them its just a thought. But I really think its wrong about those AI stuff and I have to agree with you that this is not mentally healthy. It is getting worse not better. Look at those kids were go to sephora and buy anti aging cream with 10 years old and the parents allow it. By the time they are 20 they will need plastic surgery. So you guys will be very busy soon. 😊; Those plain women at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1099"">18:19</a> look fine to me.; The world is getting crazier and crazier; IM SORRY WTF IS WRONG WITH THAT THUMBNAIL. WHO ARE YOU TO SHAME OTHERS, YOU UG….UMMM. Before you make any other more videos, just ask yourself:<br> is it nice. <br>That’s all you gotta ask. Is it a nice thing to do to another human being, not just one, but many strangers that could identify with  the shame that you’re throwing at them , do you ever stop and Imagine you are the person that you’re calling out that is “out of control “ think how they’re going to feel and react when they watch what you made?  that’s all you should ask yourself. <br><br>As far as I’m aware of there isn’t a tragedy of widespread death and plastic surgery, talking about delicate, every person is different,   About medicine and supporting self-esteem and something that is the patients choice. A procedure that is probably very difficult and they have thought long and hard to do. <br><br>How about this.. I really was not going to make a nice comment in the beginning, but let’s follow this a little farther<br>.. How about if I did a thumbnail of your picture with the description:“This guy thinks he’s OK looking and breed worthy apparently, because he can be the arbiter of what people should, should not look like, thumbnail title with a picture of you and the other person:“ I AM the beauty standard! therefore, these people are not!, let me tell you why!”. , would you like to see your face &amp; that quote in your feed?? How would you like that? . I would be completely accurate. I would make assumptions reasonable by what you had said.  I <br><br>I’m not gonna tell you what you should do with this video. You should know yourself . <br><br>There could be insults from all over the world, that could be directed to the people that you discuss,  could occur  on public discourse I.e. Twitter, etc. because of your video and people have killed themselves from much less ..with just a few comments in a public town written bulletin, Board or high school discourse or church supper. That person in your video could receive hundreds a day of Shame. It is people like you that have gotten out of control thinking that people need to hear what you say. It doesn’t make the world a better place, then why why with everything that’s going on do you have to do it, can you find a different way of making money?; I thought I was watching Keanu Reeves, and it was not him. So, I un-subscribed. Speaking of hair implants. I was thinking about Richard Simmons and Trump and remembering Simmons and wondering why Trump I think hasn&#39;t had hair implants. Simmons did it, I think, in his 30s after going bald from that disease that makes hair fall out.; Glad Im a plain approaching middle aged man; This Edv guy is quite racist towards White people so please don&#39;t promote him; Getting old is the most natural part of life, but we have been made to belive that we should fight the aging process.; I think we all turn into the general mold because we will soon be all AI robots who look the same. It is all about making people get used to it become accepting of the next step in human evolution.; Most refreshing display of ethical medical  professionnalism. Kudos!; If the double standard didn&#39;t exist there would be 1/4 of the current plastic surgeons.; Are you following the detransitioners lawsuits in the USA?<br>There is a young man in the UK harmed by gender ideology who is suing the NHS, his lawyers are doing it without fees upfront and they are  a major famous law firm.<br><br>This is the biggest medical scandal of our generation. <br><br>Italy are pro secuting doctors over puberty stopping drugs.<br><br>Not to mention the many cases of assaults on women and children by men pretending to be women in hospitals toilets and changing rooms. As the mother of a young daughter it makes me sick.; I think as a (bald) James McAvoy look-a-like you’ll probably find aspects of this bizarre or unrelatable, many people aren’t blessed with natural good looks, so if it makes them feel better mentally I’m all for AI enhancement.; i want look completely different, HATE my &quot;face&quot; its unbearable for me 🙈🤢🤮😒😡☠💀; 🤔…The thumbnail photo is clickbait to lure people into the actual video.; i am 22, and i wanna do face lift next year to look 8 years old, i&#39;m doing this to get my ex teacher&#39;s attention, i missed the opportunity before, he likes kids; Back in the day when one could only create a cartoon avatar of oneself with limited template options, I did one for myself based on hair color, eye color, ethnicity and posted it on my social media since I did not want to show my real identity. It was seriously weird the guys who followed this cartoon avatar asking to be &quot;friends&quot;. I am like guys this is a cartoon you are looking at. So I took it down because it just weirded me out. But there must be some desperately lonely people out there.; Below the neck ages, so yes you have to consider that we start looking frailer as we age, and or the body skin ages and sags. They are starting to use AI models I think online for ads, and selling of lingerie for example.  The women are just too perfect to be real.   Here they show some AI women and you would not know,.   A bit of filter is not terrible to blur the face a tad, and it does look like many esp women are doing it, along with lighting. People are on camera due to SM longer and imperfections stand out on modern cameras, so helping oneself a bit is ok but not too much.; I entered 40 recently and I realized i was blind when I was younger thinking that I’m ugly! Bc I didn’t love myself until Jesus saved me and started to heal my soul ❤️‍🩹 and delivered from lies. And now I just want to be like me again when I was younger and look nice ❤<br>By the way dr. Your skin is beautiful 🤍 and thank you for the discussion <br>God bless you; You don’t need a filter.; Scary!; Eventually we we all end up looking like 👽; Anyone remember the movie called Surrogates? It reminds me of this; Asian kid is annoying.; You forgot to tell about people like me, who got in a car accident and my face changed after that. I really hoped and prayed for my face to be back to normal after what happened. I couldn&#39;t even smile for 6 months. But after antibiotics , long therapy and a little scar removals it&#39;s all good now. I&#39;m happy 👾. But back into that time it was really scary how I looked. It really has affected me mentally.; How much of this is a fear of dying, an attempt to stop the inevitable? At some point your body starts breaking down and  you&#39;re still trying to look twenty years younger.. What does that say about how you feel about your ethnicity when you no longer look like anyone in your family? I have my father&#39;s bump on my nose showing my Italian heritage and I would never change that.; I think people should just assume anyone online is using all available tools to look their best including not really existing lol. Also the line for me is looking unnatural/ like I&#39;m not myself. But the line for everyone else should be what makes them happy/surgeon agrees is safe etc.; That girl at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1189"">19:49</a> doesn&#39;t look human. Thanks for linking to the original video.; I feel bad for the women who&#39;ve had bad nose jobs and have to live with them. There are so many of them out there. Do they know their noses look awful or do they think they look OK?  It seems just a tweak is very hard to get right, and then there is the passage of time where things may go awry.; In my late forties I grew a beard to hide my jowl progression. I can cope with my sagging eyelids and excessive hair on my body. I like looking a natural 60.<br>My beard has turned grey, my hair and eyebrows are naturally mid/light brown still.<br>I like my look. <br>We need to stop being so Vain. It&#39;s fine to age....just be graceful when doing so.; Human sims; My daughter is like Elizabeth Taylor ... born beautiful.<br>Beauty has a dark side I never knew about until my daughter came along. <br><br>Elementary school kids would tell her, &quot;You should be a model!&quot; and the next day, they gang up as a group and bully her. Her supposed best friend slapped her out of nowhere, and she forgave her. Then they became teenagers and suddenly, all the boys paid all the attention to my daughter, but her friends became jealous and wanted to &quot;curb stomp&quot; my child.  You wind up a very lonely girl. So, she aimed to please these &quot;friends&quot;, and they used her (money, car, etc.). But then, yet another queen of jealousy got on the internet and bullied her some more, saying such hurtful things, I wanted to call the FBI and report her for internet bullying. And, all these supposed &quot;friends&quot; joined in the bullying again! Finally, high school is over! Ya think it&#39;s over? Nah! 50 year old women at work began doing the same thing! <br><br>Men? Nearly all of them want to bed her. Even a teacher stalked her. We&#39;d go to a restaurant and the waitress hands her a note with a phone number from a man sitting somewhere in the restaurant inviting her to call him. Other times, we&#39;d find notes on our car. She&#39;d get harassed at work by some dude  who couldn&#39;t take no for an answer. <br><br>As her mother, I&#39;m appalled and fearful for her.; I LOVE Edvasian and Dr. Linkov.  This is the best creation since ice and cream.; That&#39;s funny, but one thing they can&#39;t surgically enhance, filter out or AI generate is their intelligence....; Finch them; Couldn&#39;t find the link to the original video...pls add the link thx; This is very sad.... People will do anything to get views, likes and approval. All thanks to crappy social media. I guess you can&#39;t stop it&#39;s but there&#39;s going to be a lot of mentally tortured people in the future. Thank God He keeps me sane ❤; I used to have a flat nose that went across half my face and everybody would ask me if I was albino... Used to have a really fat wide face and wide jaw... Aging has caused my face to sag a little bit which has given me more of a  oval face with v-jaw... My nose is no longer flat and half of my face... Age has absolutely changed my face and honestly I like it better; Hahahahahahahahah 😂😂😂; Then there&#39;s fat transfer. Ugh.Soon, We might get to look the way we want to. It will be scary, but I can see it coming. This will be horrible if someone has BDD and keeps changing. Mehan Fox looks too different these days. Ugh. Too much! TOO MUCH; I had to get a new ID when I cut my hair and dyed it.  I couldn&#39;t get into bars because no one believed it was me!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2qP9wC_F68&amp;t=1130"">18:50</a>. I said the same thing, Dr Linkov, but also including the dating apps and dating environment there is now. So glad I found my husband in 2011 before dating apps! I cant inagine trying to navigate it all and dealing with the environment that dating has become...no thank you!!; I’ve never had a desire to meet anyone online.<br>If do not make someone’s acquaintance in person, not interested.; All the more reason to get off social media, especially when it comes to dating.  Guys don’t want to date anyway. They want to get laid.; Dishonesty is never cool with me. Though prejudice is also not cool with me based on looks. I guess we are people nowadays who are ethically challenged. So I guess it&#39;s not so much a case of you lied to me but why did you lie to me.; I don&#39;t buy the &quot;if it makes you feel more confident, then do it.&quot; No, go to the gym. Go to therapy. Go meditate. Go cultivate some self-awareness. Go do something with your life that doesn&#39;t revolve around your looks. Learn to just accept your lot in life. Work with what you have.

"BodyImage in Kpop (body shaming , plastic surgery , whitewashing etc )",yoonist,2021-08-09T14:40:03Z,(54291) Hi guys today we are going to be talking about the dangerous and extremely unrealistic beauty standards about body ...,oVSwwm41ZFU,"as a korean im just gonna put it out there.<br>pale skin has been a standard for us from wayyyyy long ago<br>ik it can be a controversy in like, US i guess? but its rly not for south korea<br>just bc we have different culture and beauty standards, that doesnt make us toxic.; i mean honestly i&#39;m not saying we have the authority to diagnose somi with something as serious as an eating disorder but like also being 46.2 kg when you&#39;re 172 cm tall is so incredibly concerning? somi did make a mistake posting her weight like that but like... it&#39;s also just not really possible to have that low of a weight and be in good health. not being in literally critical condition? yeah, sure. but with how tall somi is and how much she exercises (by her own admission too!) it is absolutely possible for someone to unintentionally undereat. and somi has had to face terrible hate for her weight before and been put on horrendous diets like that one where the only food she was allowed to eat was bananas and unlike some other idols, she hasn&#39;t always been skinny. so the idea that she&#39;s actually healthy now... like i hope it&#39;s true because i want the best for her but i doubt it. a woman her height doing her level of exercise could easily eat like 3k calories and gain nothing; Wtheck I am getting a freaking JUVÈDERM ad lmao. That’s ironic☹️; i dont promote skinny or fat shaming but i think you guys are seriously fucked in the head if you think somi is healthy. whether or not she has an ed is her business and bullying her online isnt going to help anything but defending her actions w posting her height and weight isnt helping anyone. that is classic ed behaviour, go on tumblr or any other platform and you can see people acting the exact same way. having a parasocial relationship with someone doesnt mean youre entitled to defending them, you can criticise someone and still support them.; i cant even watch the clips of jihyo being degraded the way she was back then. it’s just so awful, she was so young who knows how harmful that shit was to her mental health. like why would you say those things to a teenager…<br>i’m sure she knows now but i wish i could tell her she’s like one of the most beautiful people i have ever fucking seen both back then and now.; Somi still shouldn’t have posted her weight; I think the decision on plastic surgery is a bit of both, insecurity by being put down (by the company) but also themselves wanting it. Most international fans have a specific mindset and then they come into kpop and assume the worst for everything all the time. We can’t forget how normalised plastic surgery is in SK, such as middle schoolers getting double eyelid surgery as birthday gifts etc. PS ist much less of a big deal over there and immensly popular in the general public. Now imagine an industry where most things are based on your visual presentation, of course PS is important there too. I believe most Idols themselves want to look their best so it’s not hard to imagine that many of them on their own accord could want PS. I absolutly believe that there where Idols that were bullied into surgery but I don’t think the majority of kpop idols fall under that category.; A lot of you are judging Koreans without understanding the history and culture. Whitewashing issue in Korea is a total nonsense. Korean people’s preference of white skin is not related to ethnicity AT ALL. <br><br>Korea used to be a hierarchical society in the past. That meant high class stayed indoors all day while low class worked outside all day. So you could naturally tell people’s social status by looking how tanned he/she were. Having a white skin symbolized novelty and wealth. THAT is why Korean people have longing for white skin. You guys are overreacting, please.; body shaming is really bad, it does have an effect on you both mentally and physically, especially when public figures like them. I never get why people do that, even you have a certain preference doesn&#39;t mean that these idols should follow, nor anyone. I am being fat-shamed by literally everyone I see, cause I&#39;m not in the size that I used to be, going through a lot for almost 1 year for a lot of reasons, and those who know still doesn&#39;t care if I am ok, but always wanna point out about acnes and fat like I don&#39;t care about it, I just wanna stay sane and I am completely ok with my body as I am healthy. it kills us most of the time when we hear this.<br>these idols have to go through a lot and it&#39;s so cheap and vulgar to pick on someone&#39;s body; This video deserves kudos for saying that fat shaming is worse ! It&#39;s true 😭; Honestly i need to say this, somi is NOT healthy, according to her height and weight she is severly underweight. im not sending her any hate she is free to do whatever but for any young impressionable girls out there, don&#39;t try to get to 44kg you will seriously harm yourself trying health wise; Idk dude, pre debut Karina looks like rn Karina to me. Lisa 100% had a phynoplasty, but there can be various reasons for actually needing one, not just rando getting one; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> ish yessss while I am sorry to all those who experience skinny shaming it happens no where near as much as with fat shaming; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=247"">4:07</a> “telling someone to stop eating just because they aren’t visually appealing to you Is fuked up”<br>My Brain: in serious agreement<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The OTHER side of my brain: telling someone to stop eating just because they aren’t visually appealing to you is 😌fuck😜 it👅 up 💅🏼; The way txt used to non-stop talk about how skinny and pale they are always made me so uncumfy; For plastic surgery section....lisa  look same before N after ...why put her in that section; For plastic surgery section....lisa  look same before N after ...why put her in that section; seeing the Purple Kiss in the background, people “fat shamed” and judged Swan’s body. the girl is 17, leave her alone! no matter what age she is leave her alone but especially when she’s still a teenager!; Thanks for what you said about the seriousness of fat shaming!; I don&#39;t think Somi suffer skinny shaming, cuz 1. she is not naturally skinny 2. she always post in her media what she do, specially exercise so I think her fans were just worried that she got anorexia, cuz she said that she can&#39;t watched her videos of birthday era cuz she thinks she looks fat. like bro; Honestly speaking, as a peson who has been both fat-shamed and skinny-shamed, the fatshaming affects me more. To me, phrases like &quot;you take up so much space&quot; (which has actually been said to me before) affects me more than phrases like &quot;you are so thin, the wind would blow you over if it were a windy day&quot;. Though these are probably not really extreme/hurtful cases of commenting on one&#39;s weight, they still do hurt me a bit, and are done with the intent of hurting me and making me feel insecure.<br>By the way, my bmi, though probably not the best way to say how healthy one is, is around 15.6 (i&#39;m quite young and this bmi is fine for people my age, just on the lower side of acceptable bmi for those of my age, in case you guys are worried about me), so i&#39;m quite skinny compared to most people my age.<br>Overall, bodyshaming, whether it be fatshaming or skinnyshaming, is not okay, and should not be as normalised as it is.<br><br>You are free to have a different opinion, and I would be very interested in reading your opinion on bodyshaming and which one you find more hurtful/serious.; another thing that I feel is missing about plastic surgery, is that —after listening to a lot ex-trainees and did a little research— most of the times you see a predebut vs actual photo of an idol and is clear the surgery, it is <b>not a personal choice</b> but the very same company obligating/requiring them to get it. SM is said to be one of those companies but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s the majority of entertainment companies.; I agree 100% w the first one. Like both are problematic, but fat shaming in the kpop industry is much more of an insult that skinny shaming. I get skinny shamed on insta cuz ppl tell me my ribs stick out and that my body is disproportionate due to my tiddie being an average size compared to the rest of my frame. Like bitch, what do u know? Skinny shaming sucks when ppl tell u look weird and anorexic, which is never the case. I have a very fast metabolism, suck it up!; Jihyo is literally my bias in twice and I absolutely love and adore her. She is GOD JIHYO for a reason. Let them haters troll on her weight, she’ll still be 10x times better and more successful than them.; I also noticed that when an anti fan says &#39;oh, this idol is fat&#39; the whole kpop comunity takes it as an insult to the idol when it should not. Fans defend their idol by saying &#39;no she isn&#39;t fat, she is beautiful&#39; or whatever. Since when was &#39;fat&#39; the synonym for &#39;ugly&#39; or &#39;unattractive&#39;? This just reinforces the idea that being fat is not pretty...; Somi didn&#39;t look healthy  last comeback she was more than good; Someone straight up called Yeonjun fat in vlive first time in his solo vlive second on Beomgyu, Soobin and Yeonjun vlive. I&#39;m happy that Soobin responded to it.<br>→And that fan who said weight lifting when they asked that question like seriously? And some people  even made memes on Jihyo the coke one if anyone has ever seen it they compared Jihyo.; What will happen if they get pregnant in the future, they will surely be over 50kg, will they also say that the women are fat? How rude.; I think the main issue I have with the Somi situation is not her weight (if she says shes healthy thats cool with me) its her basically saying she posted her height and weight to prove to haters that shes skinny now. That seems like a dangerous mindset to have since it comes across that she lost the weight to prove a point not cause it was just her wanting to look thinner, i just hope she has good people around her to make sure shes looking after herself both physically and mentally; since you hav bodyimage, PS in title you should hav added blackpink lisa ... one of the most famous kpop idol and the most famous kpop idol infamous for PS,skin whitening,fillers etc which gave her the current status of &quot;doll&quot; 🤭 n &quot;model&quot;; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=150"">2:30</a> more than ideal is necessary our body is not capable of holding so many weight also that being obese comes with health problems that will only make you die early.; I really liked this video and what you had to say. You did a good job defining how fat shaming is systemic while skinny shaming is solely bullying: both wrong, but the former is societal oppression. Also how colorism works in Korea, not many people get that it stems from classism, not white supremacy like here in the west, so again kudos!<br><br>I do disagree on the Somi take, and here’s my issue. (Sorry for the wall of text, this is a very dense topic) <br>People aren’t just judging her based off her look. She posted her actual weight for all to see, 46ish kg, and this weight aligns with the unhealthy weight standard that all kpop girls are held to. Ashley in a Dive Studios podcast talked about how female idols are generally expected to stay under 50kg no matter their height, and she shared how the only way she and most people she trained with could do it is to practice disordered eating. Amber has said similarly in the past as well. When Somi posted that picture in celebration, she was celebrating reaching the unhealthy goal the kpop industry has set for its idols. Tho it’s understandable she would celebrate, because she has most likely been told for most of her career that this goal is important to achieve, she is still celebrating her own abuse. Now of course this is not her fault. She is not responsible for being trained to see being underweight as healthy. That’s on the kpop industry as a whole. However, I do think it’s unrealistic to think she got down to that unhealthy weight in a healthy way, especially when people who are shorter than her admit to using ed to achieve it.<br><br>I don’t condone anyone shaming her for her weight, because that will not help her at all. Neither will telling her to eat, but I do think it’s understandable with the above, and how normalized Ed is in the kpop industry, to be concerned that Somi might be at risk.; Yoonist* you only spoke straight facts in this video. I can’t disagree with a single thing said in this. Not only that the writing for this video was very well written, and you gave so much logic and reasoning especially in the body shaming segment explaining why you believe fat shaming is more harmful than skinny shaming. <br><br>If I may add a comment to your last segment, white washing, that this standard makes it very difficult for natural dark skinned Koreans or brown, South East Asian and Pacific Islander idols to debut or be famous. This whitewashing, no matter the intention, HAS resulted in idols, especially those of different nationalities like BlackPink’s Lisa from Thailand and Twice’s Tzuyu from Taiwan to be ostracized and looked down upon by netizens and many can’t look beyond their skin color to see their talent. It’s fuels racist and colorist ideology, and in order to combat that I will and continue to applaud, support, and stan all the idols and trainees that come from South Asia because it’s about time they finally got some representation in Kpop.; See, with the Somi situation I was also worried because that&#39;s really underweight and unnecessary but skinny shaming her and sending hate, are you serious?? Be worried okay even I am but don&#39;t shame her!; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only a kpop problem but also Korean society problem too, I watched that one video I think by Asian Boss where they asked Korean girls what is the ideal weight.. One of them even said they calculated the ideal weight by (your height) - 115 and for ballet (your height) - 120<br>WTF!! If that&#39;s the case then I would be just 30 and 35 kg and underweight 🤦‍♀️I am shocked at how far these standards go.; god and jesus doesnt even care if your fat or skinny what he cares your heart. If there too fat or too skinny there just humans and also that&#39;s there problem if there body shaming someone and also the manegers why should they care for someone&#39;s body does he/she knows that no one is perfect in this world even hes/she&#39;s not perfect and also they shouldn&#39;t judge the idols body that&#39;s why idols is literally falling fainting in stages its because there unhealthy if those mangers really has problems.; can we please normalize complimenting someone without mentioning their weight?<br>so instead of &quot; Wow she gained weight, she look healthy, body goals&quot; or &quot; Oh she lost weight thats so inspirational, she seems lighter and happier&quot;. we can say &quot; I love her, she so beautiful&quot; or &quot; She&#39;s such an inspiration, i strive to be as happy as her&quot;. Please choose words carefully, in fact, being healthy doesn&#39;t have a certain look!; Wait I always get triggered when I see people hating on darker skin in general. Like bro, it&#39;s literally JUST SKIN. We ALL have it, no matter what color. Nothing is wrong with that, we&#39;re all still people. R*cism and c*lorism sucks 🗿<br>I LOVE to see idol&#39;s real, unedited tan skin, it&#39;s beautiful.; My entire life, people keep saying that I should eat something because I am under weight, but it didn’t go to any extinct expect for just hating the person who said it. It was also tough for me to join any sports cause it required a certain weight scale. I loved sports but I was restricted and I ate like crazy to gain weight but for sports and sports only, at the end of the diet I gained just like 2 pounds. I felt heartbroken after the whole month of being in constant pain and stuff. It is very hard for me to gain weight, that’s all, that’s me, that’s my body, I shouldn’t force it. So should you! Please don’t force yourself into anything. If you wanna gain weight or lose weight please do it in a healthy way! I love you and thank you for making this video, yoonist.; Bro while i was watching the video, i just realized the impact of kpop on me, like when i was younger and knew little to no information about the kpop industry and just liked to listen to their music, i found myself fairly skinny and happy with it (not saying you can&#39;t be happy with a chubby body though) but now i&#39;m 13 and i have been wanting to get into the kpop industry, the impact of kpop on my body image hit me hard, i weigh 42 kg, and my height is 5&#39;3&quot; yet im sad that i weigh that much because i&#39;ve read that kpop idols are older than me and have the &quot;same&quot; weight as me (like ahn yujin from iz*one weighing &quot;45 kg&quot;), the thought put me down so bad so i tried extreme excercises and diets, wanting to weigh less than 40kg and wanting my waist to be 24 inches. I&#39;&#39;m just lucky to have my family snap me back into reality saying that i&#39;ve gained weight and fat which is a good thing (and a thought that i&#39;ve been adjusting to), but nonetheless, this culuture is SO toxic, i hate the companys that lied abt their idols weight that contributed to my and many others&#39; body dysmorphia. I wish they&#39;d see this and stop lying in order for the kids my age and the upcoming generations be happy with their own bodies and not have an unattainable and truly unreasonable body standard fixed into their heads thinking &quot;this is what the general public wants and expects from me, so the only way i can be happy is to live up to this standard&quot;; lets not give jihyo a pat on her back for embracing her skin when she literally made fun of tzuyu for it; very long rant up ahead lmao. excellent video btw, i really enjoyed it. :) <br><br>about plastic surgery... i see so often the comment of like &quot;omg this group/idol is so NATURALLY beautiful, unlike certain other idols...&quot; and it&#39;s really not the flex that those people think it is. same thing goes for weight, except it&#39;s more along the lines of &quot;wow nice to see a girl group that has healthy bodies instead of being sickly thin like every other girl group!!&quot;, but in reality they&#39;re pretty much the same at the waist as those &quot;other girl groups&quot;, they just have more toned legs/thighs. yet, those &quot;other girls&quot; supposedly have eating disorders. <br><br>kpop fans always seem to make a point of putting someone down to raise someone else up and it&#39;s so so toxic and frankly just embarrassing. they&#39;re boasting the &quot;achievements&quot; of their favs as if they were their own successes and not those of idols who don&#39;t even know that they exist. when it comes to our favs, of course a lot of the time we&#39;re going to see things through rose coloured glasses. of course we&#39;re gonna think they&#39;re the most &quot;naturally&quot; beautiful, or their bodies are &quot;goals&quot;, but in reality that&#39;s just never gonna be true, and it doesn&#39;t have to be. idols can still be worthy and beautiful and talented even if they have plastic surgery, or wear a ton of makeup. they&#39;re just adhering to the toxic beauty standards that they&#39;ve been taught by the media, the industry and their companies.<br><br>if you put people on a pedestal and they don&#39;t measure up to what you had in mind, then it&#39;s your fault for projecting that standard onto someone else in the first place. their body is their own and no one else&#39;s, they do not owe you or anyone else anything from how they look. ESPECIALLY if they&#39;re minors. you&#39;re obsessed and that&#39;s your problem, not theirs.<br><br>i understand meeting standards and keeping a &quot;presentable&quot; public image. i work as a model, partially in korea, and i&#39;ve seen it all with my own two eyes. about a third of the people over the age of 21 that i&#39;ve worked with have had plastic surgery. and honestly? as long as it&#39;s their decision and they feel happy with it, power to them. these aren&#39;t even celebrities too, just local models for domestic brands. i just think it&#39;s so delusional seeing the hoops that people try and jump through to explain why their idol completely changing their nose bridge or the shape of their face is just puberty or a glow up. <br><br>anyways, that&#39;s all, if anyone actually read all of this then i just wanted to say that ily and you&#39;re fucking beautiful the way that you are &lt;3 mwah; i think true fans would continue to support their favs no matter what weight, skin colour or looks they have. it should be more about the music, talent and personality after all.; i also hate how female idols are even getting criticised for having muscle definition (ningning, heejin) like?? they are literally performers how is it problematic to be fit. idols can truly never win; As someone who lives in the Mediterranean and is very pale, I hate it when people feel the need to comment on someone&#39;s skin tone<br>I&#39;ve been called zombie, feta cheese, vampire, Azog the pale orc among others cause it&#39;s not &quot;natural&quot; for people in this area to be fair, but truth be told, most people I know are getting spray tan, going to sun beds or literally covering themselves in oil and then frying in the sun to get that &quot;normal&quot; skin tone; Aren&#39;t beauty standards just wonderful?<br>Asians are bleaching their skin and in the West people are doing everything to look more tan; As someone who experienced both, I agree that fat-shaming is worse cause as soon as you gain some weight, people think you&#39;ve let go of yourself; I agree with the fact that fat-shaming is more normalized especially in kpop but in my opinion skinny-shaming is worse.<br>The reason for that is that people are born with fast metabolism like myself and I can’t gain weight no matter what but people that are born with slower metabolism aren’t fat but chubby and eating more than what their body can handle is bad for their health. If you’re fat you aren’t born that way but either you or your parents messed up your eating patterns but if a person is born with a fast metabolism they can’t do anything because they already eat a huge amount so their body can be healthy and if they eat more they will only feel sick like every person does. So you can’t compare the two because one is influenced by one’s actions while the other is genetics.<br><br>And I’m aware that there’re illnesses like PCOS and other that make losing weight harder but they’re not the cause of the weight gain and there’s only one illness that is the cause of weight gain is lipedema and again it only causes weight gain on the legs and nowhere else so it’s easy to spot.<br>There’re many illnesses other than genes that are the reason why people are skinny and underweight such as your body not being able to absorb nutrients and many more.<br><br>And sure people would rather be skinny and I’d always choose that over being fat(remember fat isn’t chubby). Why? I want to go on long walks on hiking adventures without my body aching like crazy. And my last point is from my experience that if you’re skinny people immediately associate you with EDs meanwhile if you’re fat you’re seen as lazy when in actuality obese people are most likely to have an ED but people love to forget that Binge Eating ends with Disorder aka BED and yes non obese people do have it too but not as often.<br><br>And about the plastic surgery point I agree 💯 but since they don’t deny it kpop is better in that regard than the American celebrities because are the kardashians really telling us they didn’t have any procedures done? At least in kpop they don’t accept or deny the allegations.; I&#39;m not sure if I 100% agree with your opinion that fat-shaming is worse than skinny-shaming. I feel that skinny-shaming is more normalized because individuals don&#39;t view calling someone skinny as an insult. Or they think saying someone is too thin will &quot;help them&quot; gain weight. I find that people completely lose their boundaries when it comes to commenting on skinny people&#39;s bodies. This is because they don&#39;t think they are damaging the person, unlike fat shaming. <br>There have been numerous times where people thought they were &quot;helping me&quot; when I was struggling with my ED. I was constantly told things like &quot;Oh you&#39;re too skinny&quot; or &quot;You need to eat more so you will gain weight&quot;. People think it&#39;s okay to say things like this because being skinny is more accepted among the beauty standard in the world, like you mentioned. While these words ended up hurting more, as I was trying to gain back weight and ended up relapsing. <br>Of course I think everyone should be validated of their pain, regardless if it&#39;s skinny shaming or fat shaming. But I don&#39;t think one should be placed on a pedestal, as it could lead to the other continually not being viewed as a big deal.; I get so annoyed of these people mindset like how can you think like that <br>All these stereotypes makes idol question there self worth<br>The only explanation I can think of is ghat these people are jealous of idols because of how successful and nice they are so they hate on them on the basis of there looks; When I watched Sixteen in the second round I believe the Judge and photographer body. Also another round when they are dancing Jay Why Pee said Jihyo is get fatter/heavier that&#39;s why she&#39;s getting slower.; I always get called &quot;fat&quot; by my relatives and family like, whenever I haven&#39;t seen a relative/family member for a while they would say something like &quot;Omg, you put on so much weight since the last time I&#39;ve seen you, you need to start eating less and exercise more!&quot; Most of the time my family just calls me straight up &quot;fat&quot; which really hurts me inside but idols have to suffer through it everyday with multiple comments about their weight so I can&#39;t even imagine how they feel.; I know right its super annoying like i am a pale person and i once was complimented by my friends mom she told she wanted my friend to be like me i was so happy thinking that was because i was sweet and got good grades but she litrally said be like her see she is so pale and looks so nice u would be better if u looked like her too like that aunty just complemented me om my skin tone and not my talent which was better thsn her daughter which i am not trying to brag.<br>Like thats not even a compliment and the weird thing is my friend was like i wish i  was pale as u i would be more prettier while i was the one who was jelous of how pretty she was 😑 whats so good about being white i dont have blood that is golden😑😑; the fact somi has said she is healthy and people still say she is ‘toO skInNy’ like 🤢; And how exactly is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> body shaming? Seriously, that is so lame for you to assume that weightlifting = unattractive? fat? or what?; fat ≠ ugly<br>fat is a wat to describe something, if you say fat is ugly then thats the problem.<br>fatphobia in the kpop industry is very normalized when it shouldnt be.<br>fat = normal; &quot;If I don&#39;t fit into this generations standard of beauty, then I will have to become a different standard&quot; - Hwasa; I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed this, but Soobin and Arin in Dolphin performance were whitewashed to the point where they looked like ghosts; guys please some of you are making it sound like all kpop stans are all toxic. THEY ARENOT!! many of them are very mature too!; as a person who got bullied in school because of being heavier than the rest of my friends, it completely triggers me up when someone makes remarks upon someone&#39;s body, doesn&#39;t matter if they are skinny or healthy. Weight is always based upon our height and idols who are like more than 5&#39;&#39;7 (female idols) having weight as 40-45 kg (88lbs-99lbs) is not healthy at all. Not saying that being skinny is not okay. people who are naturally skinny would get remarks like &#39;&#39;you&#39;re lucky&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;aren&#39;t you happy and satisfied with such a god gifted body&#39;&#39; etc etc but people with a chubby appearance (like me) would be called pig and stuff<br>here as an example, my other friend, she is really skinny and no matter what she eats, she doesn&#39;t bloats whereas if I even eat the slightest amount of food, i would look 21 weeks pregnant. She is always asking me things which would help her gain weight and i would ask her stuff to do to get skinny. what I&#39;m trynna comprehend is that we never know if anyone is satisfied with their body or not and it&#39;s their business to loose or gain weight. we are no one to make remarks or judge anyone. so just stop; fat shaming hurts, skinny shaming hurts, so let&#39;s just stop shaming people for their bodies in general? all of them are human beings with feeling so pls mind your own business. and about plastic surgery like if they don&#39;t fit in - they get hate. and if they get plastic surgery to fit in - they still get hate? where is the mf logic?!; I&#39;ve been fat shamed through my past life when I was only 12 yr old by people in the publics or in school, I admit that I was a bit chubby back then and a lot of kids made fun of me or called me nicknames like &quot;miss piggy&quot; or &quot;cow&quot; and back then I was insecure about my body image and weight, I tried to exercise and eating one apple per days and that where it lead me to an ed. It&#39;s honestly really sad cause this happens not just in the kpop industry but in society and any countries that have beauty standard.<br><br>update: If anyone wondering if I still get fat shamed daily in my life, no, I started to have more confidence on my body image and finally learn how to love myself for who I am. There still some people judge my body image, but I just ignore their judgemental looks/opinions :) cause idgaf about their opinions anymore.; The thing with whitewashing is that other than changing the tone of their skin, it also serves the major purpose of making their skin look smoother (because imperfections and details will blur out when you brighten the image. shadows and creases will disappear too).<br>The problem with this is that when idols appear in more natural lighting or in slightly unflattering harsh lighted press photos etc they are heavily bashed on for their skin texture or imperfections and creases.<br><br>On a different note, thank you for explaining that the desire for pale skin comes from the whole rich vs working class ideology rather than &quot;oh they want to look like a white person&quot; because delulu white people and the western media sure do love to make it all about them...; Somi should have been left alone. No questions asked people really took that and tried to make her a bad guy when she did nothing wrong. Her body type is very different from others.; I won&#39;t say I&#39;m obese, but according to my age range, I am quite tall and overweight. I am a teenage girl and I&#39;m 5&#39;3.5 and I weigh around 130-135. I will be called fat and unhealthy according to the standards but if you see me I&#39;m don&#39;t look unhealthy, I look normal and I eat quite healthy. I guess my height plays a huge factor since the taller you are the more you weigh. Also being fat is not a bad thing some people were born like that or they develop some sort of disease that makes them gain weight, while some can&#39;t really lose weight. I&#39;ve tried to lose 20 pounds, but I gave up, the first time I tried I lost 10 pounds and I ended up getting it back so I stop dieting, however, I do eat healthily and take walks/run here, and there.; These standards really sound very horrifying and everyone can&#39;t do it. I just wish that some of these standards can just not exist anymore; honestly, it’s clear that some people really don’t know what a true, underweight, malnourished body looks like bc somi’s isn’t just not that. somi has lots of muscle and you can tell she really focused on working out for her weight-loss this time around. she looks strong and not even close to malnourished. she said herself that she’s healthy and strong and we should take that bc her health is her business. if something was really wrong, her family or even her company would step in.; here’s another thing, not solely exclusive to the k-pop industry: neutralizing thinness and body appearance doesn’t mean you’re “normalizing” or promoting obesity at the same time. a lot of people have the general notion that thinness isn’t everything and lots of people counter that with saying that person is promoting obesity, but two things can be true at the same time. being too thin and also being too heavy are not healthy and neither of them should be promoted. you still have zero place to tell someone whether or not they need to lose or gain weight bc someone’s own body is their business, not yours. even in the name of health, we should solely focus on doing things for bettering the function of our bodies rather than for vanity; Bighit in the early days was so toxic, the members too. Not to make you feel bad but Jimin&#39;s intense diet is because he got called a pig by the Jin. He was being so serious about it. Then Jimin start to diet in a unhealthy way. Now he camt even get back to gain weight because his metabolism just gave up. Jimin is so thin for someone who is 1.74cm tall.<br>Same goes with Taehyung in their Wing era. But Tae is someone who don&#39;t give a shit about how he looks so he didn&#39;t really take it negatively like Jimin.<br>And Jungkook. Do you know why he&#39;s exercising so much to have a dreamy body? Because in their early days he got told by staffs that he&#39;s body ain&#39;t sexy at all and he should be for someone who&#39;s the center of the group he was hit by manager at that time. I still remember us asking Bighit to fire that manger. He was a damn child at thag time.<br><br>So yeah Bighit wasn&#39;t the good company y all think it&#39;s.; Idols literally the most insecure people in the world because of kpop fans and the companies. Then companies make them music about being powerful, love self teach fans to love themselves but they ain&#39;t all that; Idols have a lot of young fans who want to be like them so I kinda find it weird for somi to post her weight as it might trigger people but we should be calling then too skinny as we can&#39;t simply tell if their healthy or not looking at them; still do not agree with somi and her decision to post whatever that was for her millions of young fans to see. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=530"">8:50</a> she was fighting back cuz she got hate ? so her revenge was “look im SKINNY im not ugly like u think!” …..cuz fat=ugly? mm ok. idc shes still wrong and you’d think she knows that a large amount of her fans and kpop fans have eating disorders and use the idols for thinspo. i lost my respect for her; I am so proud of jihyo for never giving up . She’s so sweet and worked her to be the main vocal and leader of a famous girl group . I am also glad she exercised and didn’t just starve herself I just wish the general public of kpop and the kpop world wasn’t so focused on looks but she really looks happy and pleased with her appearance so I just hope this for every kpop Idol; The whitewashing thing bothers me a lot. Asians got such beautiful skin ton. I hate how they think &quot;pale&quot; is superior, when in FACT every colour is equally respectable. The industry makes the idols look as if  people who came from a Disney World; its not even about &quot;what are you talking about she&#39;s so pretty she&#39;s not fat&quot; when it&#39;s not an insult if someone&#39;s fat? its basic decency to not comment on someones appearance and body. It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re conventionally attractive to you or not it&#39;s just not right to call them ugly or fat (in a discriminatory tone)<br>This always ticked me off. it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re a sweet person or &quot;they&#39;re so pretty though&quot; it&#39;s just not right even though they&#39;re not pretty to you personally; Jihyo and Jeongyeon are one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever seen in my entire life; Tbh, my lil sis fell super insecure about her weight when she saw Somi&#39;s ig story about her hight and weight my sis is only 12 and she has started dieting and has only eaten 1 apple a day.. I&#39;m supper worried for her and In my opinion Kpop idols shouldn&#39;t share their exact weight since most of their fans are  teenagers and can make them feel insecure about their weight and overall their appearance.; MY main problem with the Fair skin standard in the Korean industry is not the beautu standard itself but the fact that they put so much emphasis on having fair skin and that anyone who does not have fair skin are the people with the issue here.<br>I think that&#39;s why many international fans are so infatuated with tanner idols.<br><br>It&#39;s like, it&#39;s fine to have your fair skin preference but like don&#39;t make it seem like it is the ONLY feature that is considered beautiful or widely accepted in a person.<br><br>What do you guys think?; YASS THANK U FOR THIS 20 MINUTE VIDEO, I WAS SO BORED; I remember Taehyung apologized for getting tanned while filming his drama. That&#39;s why whitewashing needs to stop-idols should know their natural skin colour is beautiful and they don&#39;t need to have pale skin!!; I&#39;m glad Kai embraces his tanned skin. I remember he said he doesn&#39;t have plans to become paler. He&#39;s important representation and a great role model for fellow asians. ❤️❤️❤️; Ok about white washing, i used to be insecure about my brown(tan) skin color because my mom and my sister had a lighter skin tone than mine . Whenever they come out after shower their faces look lighter and cleaner. So i thought maybe the solution was soap and i have tried rubbing soap to look lighter (smh to my 13 year old self) . Later i got to know why i have this color as i got more knowledge about Genetics (i am a med student) and i realized that i had the skin tone of my mom and dad(who has a dark skin tone) and that my sister got the skin tone gene from my mother more. In the end , skin tone is because of genes not because you are dirty or anything . And all skin colors are pretty.; honestly I understand why people were worried about somi (the mean and insulting comments are of course not okay) but somi never appeared as thin as her latest comeback and she said multiple times that it was sometimes hard for her to diet (remember that she has been told her entire teenage years that she should diet by her company and by the toxic beauty standards). She said that she ate 3 bananas a day to diet so honestly with all of these informations I understand why people were worried. Now that she said on a live recently that she is eating healthy I think everyone should stop commenting about her weight and how they are worried for her because I think if she was dieting hard she understood (with people worrying about her) that she shouldn&#39;t go lower her weight even more!; Wait can someone tell me who that was who called ji hyo a weightlifter????; <b>the way people normalize these is-</b>; Wow this video popped up right when I was looking at whitewashed ateez photos; what goes into people’s heads that makes them think that talking about someone’s weight okay?<br><br>unless the person being mentioned talks about their weight and is willing to have a conversation about it, then don’t talk about it. it’s literally that simple.<br><br>and how does someone’s weight affect their talent?<br>exactly, it doesn’t. <br>why do we listen to our faves? bc of their music.<br><br>you can be any weight and still put out great music.; My heart broke for Jihyo. She&#39;s such a sweet girl.; That thumbnail tho 👌; In my opinion skinny shaming is as bad as fat shaming , cause i have a skinny body type and i have been skinny shamed by my own relatives . The most insulting one was my relatives saying i look like a stick when i was 9 or 10 and asked me to eat more. As i grew up i thought i had some kind of eating disorder or disease because my sister and my parents both have normal body type while i had skinny one. Even my friends unintentionally talk about how &quot;bony&quot; i am which also was a reason i had those kind of thought. Now i got to know about body shaming and that there are people like who have the same experience as me.; Compared to korean and Chinese people (mostly idols and actors), Japanese people are not ashamed of their natural skin color, they don&#39;t whitewash themselves. And they look way natural and beautiful; You! Yes you!! You should stop caring about everyone&#39;s opinion, they can have their own opinion of course but at least they should not hurt other people with it. Stop caring about what people say about you. You are beautiful in your own way, if people don&#39;t like what they see they should just look away. Stop hurting other people&#39;s feelings.; Toxic kpop fans be setting unrealistic beauty standards on idols but they can’t even achieve that themselves.; Jihyo looked so good in the thumbnail Dayum. If she&#39;s fat imagine me; About me:<br>Im Asian who is tanned skin and skinny, people always tell how &quot;im so dark&quot;, Yes im tanned because im South Indian, and for skinny IM BORN SKINNY. Im like this because im Dravidian with a bit of Burmese Blood. <br><br>And for plastic surgery: It&#39;s ok to have it. Some are forced while some might want to have to, you should never shame them, normalize plastic surgery, Im a huge blink and its kinda obvious that Lisa has plastic surgery (My bias wrecker is Lisa don&#39;t kill me) but if she wanted to get it, we should be ok with it and respect her decisions.<br>I wanna get a nose surgery when i get older; So I do agree with every point that you made, I just wanted to add something. Even if the idols called fat are not fat, saying that &quot;they&#39;re not even fat&quot; makes it sound like being fat is a bad thing. We do have to take into consideration that some people&#39;s bodies are made that way, and while it isn&#39;t the beauty standard being fat is not the same as being obese ( since you mentioned you do not promote obesity) I&#39;ve met plenty of people that are on the bigger side that are way healthier than me, if that&#39;s what you wanted to get at. I know everything you said came from a good place and you didn&#39;t mean anything malicious but I just wanted to let you know that you could&#39;ve worded that a little bit better. Anywaaay, love your videos. Take care &lt;3; I hate it when ppl call someone fat and when they finnally loose weight and happy for that they start calling them skinny ?<br>Do these ppl know how much difficult it is gain or loose weight by putting effort ?🙄; the worst part is they would get so much hate for their appearance if they dont fit the standards which forces them to get work done; Hey❤❤😎; Wow im kinda early....","BodyImage in Kpop (body shaming , plastic surgery , whitewashing etc ) (54291) Hi guys today we are going to be talking about the dangerous and extremely unrealistic beauty standards about body ... as a korean im just gonna put it out there.<br>pale skin has been a standard for us from wayyyyy long ago<br>ik it can be a controversy in like, US i guess? but its rly not for south korea<br>just bc we have different culture and beauty standards, that doesnt make us toxic.; i mean honestly i&#39;m not saying we have the authority to diagnose somi with something as serious as an eating disorder but like also being 46.2 kg when you&#39;re 172 cm tall is so incredibly concerning? somi did make a mistake posting her weight like that but like... it&#39;s also just not really possible to have that low of a weight and be in good health. not being in literally critical condition? yeah, sure. but with how tall somi is and how much she exercises (by her own admission too!) it is absolutely possible for someone to unintentionally undereat. and somi has had to face terrible hate for her weight before and been put on horrendous diets like that one where the only food she was allowed to eat was bananas and unlike some other idols, she hasn&#39;t always been skinny. so the idea that she&#39;s actually healthy now... like i hope it&#39;s true because i want the best for her but i doubt it. a woman her height doing her level of exercise could easily eat like 3k calories and gain nothing; Wtheck I am getting a freaking JUVÈDERM ad lmao. That’s ironic☹️; i dont promote skinny or fat shaming but i think you guys are seriously fucked in the head if you think somi is healthy. whether or not she has an ed is her business and bullying her online isnt going to help anything but defending her actions w posting her height and weight isnt helping anyone. that is classic ed behaviour, go on tumblr or any other platform and you can see people acting the exact same way. having a parasocial relationship with someone doesnt mean youre entitled to defending them, you can criticise someone and still support them.; i cant even watch the clips of jihyo being degraded the way she was back then. it’s just so awful, she was so young who knows how harmful that shit was to her mental health. like why would you say those things to a teenager…<br>i’m sure she knows now but i wish i could tell her she’s like one of the most beautiful people i have ever fucking seen both back then and now.; Somi still shouldn’t have posted her weight; I think the decision on plastic surgery is a bit of both, insecurity by being put down (by the company) but also themselves wanting it. Most international fans have a specific mindset and then they come into kpop and assume the worst for everything all the time. We can’t forget how normalised plastic surgery is in SK, such as middle schoolers getting double eyelid surgery as birthday gifts etc. PS ist much less of a big deal over there and immensly popular in the general public. Now imagine an industry where most things are based on your visual presentation, of course PS is important there too. I believe most Idols themselves want to look their best so it’s not hard to imagine that many of them on their own accord could want PS. I absolutly believe that there where Idols that were bullied into surgery but I don’t think the majority of kpop idols fall under that category.; A lot of you are judging Koreans without understanding the history and culture. Whitewashing issue in Korea is a total nonsense. Korean people’s preference of white skin is not related to ethnicity AT ALL. <br><br>Korea used to be a hierarchical society in the past. That meant high class stayed indoors all day while low class worked outside all day. So you could naturally tell people’s social status by looking how tanned he/she were. Having a white skin symbolized novelty and wealth. THAT is why Korean people have longing for white skin. You guys are overreacting, please.; body shaming is really bad, it does have an effect on you both mentally and physically, especially when public figures like them. I never get why people do that, even you have a certain preference doesn&#39;t mean that these idols should follow, nor anyone. I am being fat-shamed by literally everyone I see, cause I&#39;m not in the size that I used to be, going through a lot for almost 1 year for a lot of reasons, and those who know still doesn&#39;t care if I am ok, but always wanna point out about acnes and fat like I don&#39;t care about it, I just wanna stay sane and I am completely ok with my body as I am healthy. it kills us most of the time when we hear this.<br>these idols have to go through a lot and it&#39;s so cheap and vulgar to pick on someone&#39;s body; This video deserves kudos for saying that fat shaming is worse ! It&#39;s true 😭; Honestly i need to say this, somi is NOT healthy, according to her height and weight she is severly underweight. im not sending her any hate she is free to do whatever but for any young impressionable girls out there, don&#39;t try to get to 44kg you will seriously harm yourself trying health wise; Idk dude, pre debut Karina looks like rn Karina to me. Lisa 100% had a phynoplasty, but there can be various reasons for actually needing one, not just rando getting one; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> ish yessss while I am sorry to all those who experience skinny shaming it happens no where near as much as with fat shaming; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=247"">4:07</a> “telling someone to stop eating just because they aren’t visually appealing to you Is fuked up”<br>My Brain: in serious agreement<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The OTHER side of my brain: telling someone to stop eating just because they aren’t visually appealing to you is 😌fuck😜 it👅 up 💅🏼; The way txt used to non-stop talk about how skinny and pale they are always made me so uncumfy; For plastic surgery section....lisa  look same before N after ...why put her in that section; For plastic surgery section....lisa  look same before N after ...why put her in that section; seeing the Purple Kiss in the background, people “fat shamed” and judged Swan’s body. the girl is 17, leave her alone! no matter what age she is leave her alone but especially when she’s still a teenager!; Thanks for what you said about the seriousness of fat shaming!; I don&#39;t think Somi suffer skinny shaming, cuz 1. she is not naturally skinny 2. she always post in her media what she do, specially exercise so I think her fans were just worried that she got anorexia, cuz she said that she can&#39;t watched her videos of birthday era cuz she thinks she looks fat. like bro; Honestly speaking, as a peson who has been both fat-shamed and skinny-shamed, the fatshaming affects me more. To me, phrases like &quot;you take up so much space&quot; (which has actually been said to me before) affects me more than phrases like &quot;you are so thin, the wind would blow you over if it were a windy day&quot;. Though these are probably not really extreme/hurtful cases of commenting on one&#39;s weight, they still do hurt me a bit, and are done with the intent of hurting me and making me feel insecure.<br>By the way, my bmi, though probably not the best way to say how healthy one is, is around 15.6 (i&#39;m quite young and this bmi is fine for people my age, just on the lower side of acceptable bmi for those of my age, in case you guys are worried about me), so i&#39;m quite skinny compared to most people my age.<br>Overall, bodyshaming, whether it be fatshaming or skinnyshaming, is not okay, and should not be as normalised as it is.<br><br>You are free to have a different opinion, and I would be very interested in reading your opinion on bodyshaming and which one you find more hurtful/serious.; another thing that I feel is missing about plastic surgery, is that —after listening to a lot ex-trainees and did a little research— most of the times you see a predebut vs actual photo of an idol and is clear the surgery, it is <b>not a personal choice</b> but the very same company obligating/requiring them to get it. SM is said to be one of those companies but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s the majority of entertainment companies.; I agree 100% w the first one. Like both are problematic, but fat shaming in the kpop industry is much more of an insult that skinny shaming. I get skinny shamed on insta cuz ppl tell me my ribs stick out and that my body is disproportionate due to my tiddie being an average size compared to the rest of my frame. Like bitch, what do u know? Skinny shaming sucks when ppl tell u look weird and anorexic, which is never the case. I have a very fast metabolism, suck it up!; Jihyo is literally my bias in twice and I absolutely love and adore her. She is GOD JIHYO for a reason. Let them haters troll on her weight, she’ll still be 10x times better and more successful than them.; I also noticed that when an anti fan says &#39;oh, this idol is fat&#39; the whole kpop comunity takes it as an insult to the idol when it should not. Fans defend their idol by saying &#39;no she isn&#39;t fat, she is beautiful&#39; or whatever. Since when was &#39;fat&#39; the synonym for &#39;ugly&#39; or &#39;unattractive&#39;? This just reinforces the idea that being fat is not pretty...; Somi didn&#39;t look healthy  last comeback she was more than good; Someone straight up called Yeonjun fat in vlive first time in his solo vlive second on Beomgyu, Soobin and Yeonjun vlive. I&#39;m happy that Soobin responded to it.<br>→And that fan who said weight lifting when they asked that question like seriously? And some people  even made memes on Jihyo the coke one if anyone has ever seen it they compared Jihyo.; What will happen if they get pregnant in the future, they will surely be over 50kg, will they also say that the women are fat? How rude.; I think the main issue I have with the Somi situation is not her weight (if she says shes healthy thats cool with me) its her basically saying she posted her height and weight to prove to haters that shes skinny now. That seems like a dangerous mindset to have since it comes across that she lost the weight to prove a point not cause it was just her wanting to look thinner, i just hope she has good people around her to make sure shes looking after herself both physically and mentally; since you hav bodyimage, PS in title you should hav added blackpink lisa ... one of the most famous kpop idol and the most famous kpop idol infamous for PS,skin whitening,fillers etc which gave her the current status of &quot;doll&quot; 🤭 n &quot;model&quot;; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=150"">2:30</a> more than ideal is necessary our body is not capable of holding so many weight also that being obese comes with health problems that will only make you die early.; I really liked this video and what you had to say. You did a good job defining how fat shaming is systemic while skinny shaming is solely bullying: both wrong, but the former is societal oppression. Also how colorism works in Korea, not many people get that it stems from classism, not white supremacy like here in the west, so again kudos!<br><br>I do disagree on the Somi take, and here’s my issue. (Sorry for the wall of text, this is a very dense topic) <br>People aren’t just judging her based off her look. She posted her actual weight for all to see, 46ish kg, and this weight aligns with the unhealthy weight standard that all kpop girls are held to. Ashley in a Dive Studios podcast talked about how female idols are generally expected to stay under 50kg no matter their height, and she shared how the only way she and most people she trained with could do it is to practice disordered eating. Amber has said similarly in the past as well. When Somi posted that picture in celebration, she was celebrating reaching the unhealthy goal the kpop industry has set for its idols. Tho it’s understandable she would celebrate, because she has most likely been told for most of her career that this goal is important to achieve, she is still celebrating her own abuse. Now of course this is not her fault. She is not responsible for being trained to see being underweight as healthy. That’s on the kpop industry as a whole. However, I do think it’s unrealistic to think she got down to that unhealthy weight in a healthy way, especially when people who are shorter than her admit to using ed to achieve it.<br><br>I don’t condone anyone shaming her for her weight, because that will not help her at all. Neither will telling her to eat, but I do think it’s understandable with the above, and how normalized Ed is in the kpop industry, to be concerned that Somi might be at risk.; Yoonist* you only spoke straight facts in this video. I can’t disagree with a single thing said in this. Not only that the writing for this video was very well written, and you gave so much logic and reasoning especially in the body shaming segment explaining why you believe fat shaming is more harmful than skinny shaming. <br><br>If I may add a comment to your last segment, white washing, that this standard makes it very difficult for natural dark skinned Koreans or brown, South East Asian and Pacific Islander idols to debut or be famous. This whitewashing, no matter the intention, HAS resulted in idols, especially those of different nationalities like BlackPink’s Lisa from Thailand and Twice’s Tzuyu from Taiwan to be ostracized and looked down upon by netizens and many can’t look beyond their skin color to see their talent. It’s fuels racist and colorist ideology, and in order to combat that I will and continue to applaud, support, and stan all the idols and trainees that come from South Asia because it’s about time they finally got some representation in Kpop.; See, with the Somi situation I was also worried because that&#39;s really underweight and unnecessary but skinny shaming her and sending hate, are you serious?? Be worried okay even I am but don&#39;t shame her!; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only a kpop problem but also Korean society problem too, I watched that one video I think by Asian Boss where they asked Korean girls what is the ideal weight.. One of them even said they calculated the ideal weight by (your height) - 115 and for ballet (your height) - 120<br>WTF!! If that&#39;s the case then I would be just 30 and 35 kg and underweight 🤦‍♀️I am shocked at how far these standards go.; god and jesus doesnt even care if your fat or skinny what he cares your heart. If there too fat or too skinny there just humans and also that&#39;s there problem if there body shaming someone and also the manegers why should they care for someone&#39;s body does he/she knows that no one is perfect in this world even hes/she&#39;s not perfect and also they shouldn&#39;t judge the idols body that&#39;s why idols is literally falling fainting in stages its because there unhealthy if those mangers really has problems.; can we please normalize complimenting someone without mentioning their weight?<br>so instead of &quot; Wow she gained weight, she look healthy, body goals&quot; or &quot; Oh she lost weight thats so inspirational, she seems lighter and happier&quot;. we can say &quot; I love her, she so beautiful&quot; or &quot; She&#39;s such an inspiration, i strive to be as happy as her&quot;. Please choose words carefully, in fact, being healthy doesn&#39;t have a certain look!; Wait I always get triggered when I see people hating on darker skin in general. Like bro, it&#39;s literally JUST SKIN. We ALL have it, no matter what color. Nothing is wrong with that, we&#39;re all still people. R*cism and c*lorism sucks 🗿<br>I LOVE to see idol&#39;s real, unedited tan skin, it&#39;s beautiful.; My entire life, people keep saying that I should eat something because I am under weight, but it didn’t go to any extinct expect for just hating the person who said it. It was also tough for me to join any sports cause it required a certain weight scale. I loved sports but I was restricted and I ate like crazy to gain weight but for sports and sports only, at the end of the diet I gained just like 2 pounds. I felt heartbroken after the whole month of being in constant pain and stuff. It is very hard for me to gain weight, that’s all, that’s me, that’s my body, I shouldn’t force it. So should you! Please don’t force yourself into anything. If you wanna gain weight or lose weight please do it in a healthy way! I love you and thank you for making this video, yoonist.; Bro while i was watching the video, i just realized the impact of kpop on me, like when i was younger and knew little to no information about the kpop industry and just liked to listen to their music, i found myself fairly skinny and happy with it (not saying you can&#39;t be happy with a chubby body though) but now i&#39;m 13 and i have been wanting to get into the kpop industry, the impact of kpop on my body image hit me hard, i weigh 42 kg, and my height is 5&#39;3&quot; yet im sad that i weigh that much because i&#39;ve read that kpop idols are older than me and have the &quot;same&quot; weight as me (like ahn yujin from iz*one weighing &quot;45 kg&quot;), the thought put me down so bad so i tried extreme excercises and diets, wanting to weigh less than 40kg and wanting my waist to be 24 inches. I&#39;&#39;m just lucky to have my family snap me back into reality saying that i&#39;ve gained weight and fat which is a good thing (and a thought that i&#39;ve been adjusting to), but nonetheless, this culuture is SO toxic, i hate the companys that lied abt their idols weight that contributed to my and many others&#39; body dysmorphia. I wish they&#39;d see this and stop lying in order for the kids my age and the upcoming generations be happy with their own bodies and not have an unattainable and truly unreasonable body standard fixed into their heads thinking &quot;this is what the general public wants and expects from me, so the only way i can be happy is to live up to this standard&quot;; lets not give jihyo a pat on her back for embracing her skin when she literally made fun of tzuyu for it; very long rant up ahead lmao. excellent video btw, i really enjoyed it. :) <br><br>about plastic surgery... i see so often the comment of like &quot;omg this group/idol is so NATURALLY beautiful, unlike certain other idols...&quot; and it&#39;s really not the flex that those people think it is. same thing goes for weight, except it&#39;s more along the lines of &quot;wow nice to see a girl group that has healthy bodies instead of being sickly thin like every other girl group!!&quot;, but in reality they&#39;re pretty much the same at the waist as those &quot;other girl groups&quot;, they just have more toned legs/thighs. yet, those &quot;other girls&quot; supposedly have eating disorders. <br><br>kpop fans always seem to make a point of putting someone down to raise someone else up and it&#39;s so so toxic and frankly just embarrassing. they&#39;re boasting the &quot;achievements&quot; of their favs as if they were their own successes and not those of idols who don&#39;t even know that they exist. when it comes to our favs, of course a lot of the time we&#39;re going to see things through rose coloured glasses. of course we&#39;re gonna think they&#39;re the most &quot;naturally&quot; beautiful, or their bodies are &quot;goals&quot;, but in reality that&#39;s just never gonna be true, and it doesn&#39;t have to be. idols can still be worthy and beautiful and talented even if they have plastic surgery, or wear a ton of makeup. they&#39;re just adhering to the toxic beauty standards that they&#39;ve been taught by the media, the industry and their companies.<br><br>if you put people on a pedestal and they don&#39;t measure up to what you had in mind, then it&#39;s your fault for projecting that standard onto someone else in the first place. their body is their own and no one else&#39;s, they do not owe you or anyone else anything from how they look. ESPECIALLY if they&#39;re minors. you&#39;re obsessed and that&#39;s your problem, not theirs.<br><br>i understand meeting standards and keeping a &quot;presentable&quot; public image. i work as a model, partially in korea, and i&#39;ve seen it all with my own two eyes. about a third of the people over the age of 21 that i&#39;ve worked with have had plastic surgery. and honestly? as long as it&#39;s their decision and they feel happy with it, power to them. these aren&#39;t even celebrities too, just local models for domestic brands. i just think it&#39;s so delusional seeing the hoops that people try and jump through to explain why their idol completely changing their nose bridge or the shape of their face is just puberty or a glow up. <br><br>anyways, that&#39;s all, if anyone actually read all of this then i just wanted to say that ily and you&#39;re fucking beautiful the way that you are &lt;3 mwah; i think true fans would continue to support their favs no matter what weight, skin colour or looks they have. it should be more about the music, talent and personality after all.; i also hate how female idols are even getting criticised for having muscle definition (ningning, heejin) like?? they are literally performers how is it problematic to be fit. idols can truly never win; As someone who lives in the Mediterranean and is very pale, I hate it when people feel the need to comment on someone&#39;s skin tone<br>I&#39;ve been called zombie, feta cheese, vampire, Azog the pale orc among others cause it&#39;s not &quot;natural&quot; for people in this area to be fair, but truth be told, most people I know are getting spray tan, going to sun beds or literally covering themselves in oil and then frying in the sun to get that &quot;normal&quot; skin tone; Aren&#39;t beauty standards just wonderful?<br>Asians are bleaching their skin and in the West people are doing everything to look more tan; As someone who experienced both, I agree that fat-shaming is worse cause as soon as you gain some weight, people think you&#39;ve let go of yourself; I agree with the fact that fat-shaming is more normalized especially in kpop but in my opinion skinny-shaming is worse.<br>The reason for that is that people are born with fast metabolism like myself and I can’t gain weight no matter what but people that are born with slower metabolism aren’t fat but chubby and eating more than what their body can handle is bad for their health. If you’re fat you aren’t born that way but either you or your parents messed up your eating patterns but if a person is born with a fast metabolism they can’t do anything because they already eat a huge amount so their body can be healthy and if they eat more they will only feel sick like every person does. So you can’t compare the two because one is influenced by one’s actions while the other is genetics.<br><br>And I’m aware that there’re illnesses like PCOS and other that make losing weight harder but they’re not the cause of the weight gain and there’s only one illness that is the cause of weight gain is lipedema and again it only causes weight gain on the legs and nowhere else so it’s easy to spot.<br>There’re many illnesses other than genes that are the reason why people are skinny and underweight such as your body not being able to absorb nutrients and many more.<br><br>And sure people would rather be skinny and I’d always choose that over being fat(remember fat isn’t chubby). Why? I want to go on long walks on hiking adventures without my body aching like crazy. And my last point is from my experience that if you’re skinny people immediately associate you with EDs meanwhile if you’re fat you’re seen as lazy when in actuality obese people are most likely to have an ED but people love to forget that Binge Eating ends with Disorder aka BED and yes non obese people do have it too but not as often.<br><br>And about the plastic surgery point I agree 💯 but since they don’t deny it kpop is better in that regard than the American celebrities because are the kardashians really telling us they didn’t have any procedures done? At least in kpop they don’t accept or deny the allegations.; I&#39;m not sure if I 100% agree with your opinion that fat-shaming is worse than skinny-shaming. I feel that skinny-shaming is more normalized because individuals don&#39;t view calling someone skinny as an insult. Or they think saying someone is too thin will &quot;help them&quot; gain weight. I find that people completely lose their boundaries when it comes to commenting on skinny people&#39;s bodies. This is because they don&#39;t think they are damaging the person, unlike fat shaming. <br>There have been numerous times where people thought they were &quot;helping me&quot; when I was struggling with my ED. I was constantly told things like &quot;Oh you&#39;re too skinny&quot; or &quot;You need to eat more so you will gain weight&quot;. People think it&#39;s okay to say things like this because being skinny is more accepted among the beauty standard in the world, like you mentioned. While these words ended up hurting more, as I was trying to gain back weight and ended up relapsing. <br>Of course I think everyone should be validated of their pain, regardless if it&#39;s skinny shaming or fat shaming. But I don&#39;t think one should be placed on a pedestal, as it could lead to the other continually not being viewed as a big deal.; I get so annoyed of these people mindset like how can you think like that <br>All these stereotypes makes idol question there self worth<br>The only explanation I can think of is ghat these people are jealous of idols because of how successful and nice they are so they hate on them on the basis of there looks; When I watched Sixteen in the second round I believe the Judge and photographer body. Also another round when they are dancing Jay Why Pee said Jihyo is get fatter/heavier that&#39;s why she&#39;s getting slower.; I always get called &quot;fat&quot; by my relatives and family like, whenever I haven&#39;t seen a relative/family member for a while they would say something like &quot;Omg, you put on so much weight since the last time I&#39;ve seen you, you need to start eating less and exercise more!&quot; Most of the time my family just calls me straight up &quot;fat&quot; which really hurts me inside but idols have to suffer through it everyday with multiple comments about their weight so I can&#39;t even imagine how they feel.; I know right its super annoying like i am a pale person and i once was complimented by my friends mom she told she wanted my friend to be like me i was so happy thinking that was because i was sweet and got good grades but she litrally said be like her see she is so pale and looks so nice u would be better if u looked like her too like that aunty just complemented me om my skin tone and not my talent which was better thsn her daughter which i am not trying to brag.<br>Like thats not even a compliment and the weird thing is my friend was like i wish i  was pale as u i would be more prettier while i was the one who was jelous of how pretty she was 😑 whats so good about being white i dont have blood that is golden😑😑; the fact somi has said she is healthy and people still say she is ‘toO skInNy’ like 🤢; And how exactly is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> body shaming? Seriously, that is so lame for you to assume that weightlifting = unattractive? fat? or what?; fat ≠ ugly<br>fat is a wat to describe something, if you say fat is ugly then thats the problem.<br>fatphobia in the kpop industry is very normalized when it shouldnt be.<br>fat = normal; &quot;If I don&#39;t fit into this generations standard of beauty, then I will have to become a different standard&quot; - Hwasa; I don&#39;t know if anyone else noticed this, but Soobin and Arin in Dolphin performance were whitewashed to the point where they looked like ghosts; guys please some of you are making it sound like all kpop stans are all toxic. THEY ARENOT!! many of them are very mature too!; as a person who got bullied in school because of being heavier than the rest of my friends, it completely triggers me up when someone makes remarks upon someone&#39;s body, doesn&#39;t matter if they are skinny or healthy. Weight is always based upon our height and idols who are like more than 5&#39;&#39;7 (female idols) having weight as 40-45 kg (88lbs-99lbs) is not healthy at all. Not saying that being skinny is not okay. people who are naturally skinny would get remarks like &#39;&#39;you&#39;re lucky&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;aren&#39;t you happy and satisfied with such a god gifted body&#39;&#39; etc etc but people with a chubby appearance (like me) would be called pig and stuff<br>here as an example, my other friend, she is really skinny and no matter what she eats, she doesn&#39;t bloats whereas if I even eat the slightest amount of food, i would look 21 weeks pregnant. She is always asking me things which would help her gain weight and i would ask her stuff to do to get skinny. what I&#39;m trynna comprehend is that we never know if anyone is satisfied with their body or not and it&#39;s their business to loose or gain weight. we are no one to make remarks or judge anyone. so just stop; fat shaming hurts, skinny shaming hurts, so let&#39;s just stop shaming people for their bodies in general? all of them are human beings with feeling so pls mind your own business. and about plastic surgery like if they don&#39;t fit in - they get hate. and if they get plastic surgery to fit in - they still get hate? where is the mf logic?!; I&#39;ve been fat shamed through my past life when I was only 12 yr old by people in the publics or in school, I admit that I was a bit chubby back then and a lot of kids made fun of me or called me nicknames like &quot;miss piggy&quot; or &quot;cow&quot; and back then I was insecure about my body image and weight, I tried to exercise and eating one apple per days and that where it lead me to an ed. It&#39;s honestly really sad cause this happens not just in the kpop industry but in society and any countries that have beauty standard.<br><br>update: If anyone wondering if I still get fat shamed daily in my life, no, I started to have more confidence on my body image and finally learn how to love myself for who I am. There still some people judge my body image, but I just ignore their judgemental looks/opinions :) cause idgaf about their opinions anymore.; The thing with whitewashing is that other than changing the tone of their skin, it also serves the major purpose of making their skin look smoother (because imperfections and details will blur out when you brighten the image. shadows and creases will disappear too).<br>The problem with this is that when idols appear in more natural lighting or in slightly unflattering harsh lighted press photos etc they are heavily bashed on for their skin texture or imperfections and creases.<br><br>On a different note, thank you for explaining that the desire for pale skin comes from the whole rich vs working class ideology rather than &quot;oh they want to look like a white person&quot; because delulu white people and the western media sure do love to make it all about them...; Somi should have been left alone. No questions asked people really took that and tried to make her a bad guy when she did nothing wrong. Her body type is very different from others.; I won&#39;t say I&#39;m obese, but according to my age range, I am quite tall and overweight. I am a teenage girl and I&#39;m 5&#39;3.5 and I weigh around 130-135. I will be called fat and unhealthy according to the standards but if you see me I&#39;m don&#39;t look unhealthy, I look normal and I eat quite healthy. I guess my height plays a huge factor since the taller you are the more you weigh. Also being fat is not a bad thing some people were born like that or they develop some sort of disease that makes them gain weight, while some can&#39;t really lose weight. I&#39;ve tried to lose 20 pounds, but I gave up, the first time I tried I lost 10 pounds and I ended up getting it back so I stop dieting, however, I do eat healthily and take walks/run here, and there.; These standards really sound very horrifying and everyone can&#39;t do it. I just wish that some of these standards can just not exist anymore; honestly, it’s clear that some people really don’t know what a true, underweight, malnourished body looks like bc somi’s isn’t just not that. somi has lots of muscle and you can tell she really focused on working out for her weight-loss this time around. she looks strong and not even close to malnourished. she said herself that she’s healthy and strong and we should take that bc her health is her business. if something was really wrong, her family or even her company would step in.; here’s another thing, not solely exclusive to the k-pop industry: neutralizing thinness and body appearance doesn’t mean you’re “normalizing” or promoting obesity at the same time. a lot of people have the general notion that thinness isn’t everything and lots of people counter that with saying that person is promoting obesity, but two things can be true at the same time. being too thin and also being too heavy are not healthy and neither of them should be promoted. you still have zero place to tell someone whether or not they need to lose or gain weight bc someone’s own body is their business, not yours. even in the name of health, we should solely focus on doing things for bettering the function of our bodies rather than for vanity; Bighit in the early days was so toxic, the members too. Not to make you feel bad but Jimin&#39;s intense diet is because he got called a pig by the Jin. He was being so serious about it. Then Jimin start to diet in a unhealthy way. Now he camt even get back to gain weight because his metabolism just gave up. Jimin is so thin for someone who is 1.74cm tall.<br>Same goes with Taehyung in their Wing era. But Tae is someone who don&#39;t give a shit about how he looks so he didn&#39;t really take it negatively like Jimin.<br>And Jungkook. Do you know why he&#39;s exercising so much to have a dreamy body? Because in their early days he got told by staffs that he&#39;s body ain&#39;t sexy at all and he should be for someone who&#39;s the center of the group he was hit by manager at that time. I still remember us asking Bighit to fire that manger. He was a damn child at thag time.<br><br>So yeah Bighit wasn&#39;t the good company y all think it&#39;s.; Idols literally the most insecure people in the world because of kpop fans and the companies. Then companies make them music about being powerful, love self teach fans to love themselves but they ain&#39;t all that; Idols have a lot of young fans who want to be like them so I kinda find it weird for somi to post her weight as it might trigger people but we should be calling then too skinny as we can&#39;t simply tell if their healthy or not looking at them; still do not agree with somi and her decision to post whatever that was for her millions of young fans to see. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVSwwm41ZFU&amp;t=530"">8:50</a> she was fighting back cuz she got hate ? so her revenge was “look im SKINNY im not ugly like u think!” …..cuz fat=ugly? mm ok. idc shes still wrong and you’d think she knows that a large amount of her fans and kpop fans have eating disorders and use the idols for thinspo. i lost my respect for her; I am so proud of jihyo for never giving up . She’s so sweet and worked her to be the main vocal and leader of a famous girl group . I am also glad she exercised and didn’t just starve herself I just wish the general public of kpop and the kpop world wasn’t so focused on looks but she really looks happy and pleased with her appearance so I just hope this for every kpop Idol; The whitewashing thing bothers me a lot. Asians got such beautiful skin ton. I hate how they think &quot;pale&quot; is superior, when in FACT every colour is equally respectable. The industry makes the idols look as if  people who came from a Disney World; its not even about &quot;what are you talking about she&#39;s so pretty she&#39;s not fat&quot; when it&#39;s not an insult if someone&#39;s fat? its basic decency to not comment on someones appearance and body. It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re conventionally attractive to you or not it&#39;s just not right to call them ugly or fat (in a discriminatory tone)<br>This always ticked me off. it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re a sweet person or &quot;they&#39;re so pretty though&quot; it&#39;s just not right even though they&#39;re not pretty to you personally; Jihyo and Jeongyeon are one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever seen in my entire life; Tbh, my lil sis fell super insecure about her weight when she saw Somi&#39;s ig story about her hight and weight my sis is only 12 and she has started dieting and has only eaten 1 apple a day.. I&#39;m supper worried for her and In my opinion Kpop idols shouldn&#39;t share their exact weight since most of their fans are  teenagers and can make them feel insecure about their weight and overall their appearance.; MY main problem with the Fair skin standard in the Korean industry is not the beautu standard itself but the fact that they put so much emphasis on having fair skin and that anyone who does not have fair skin are the people with the issue here.<br>I think that&#39;s why many international fans are so infatuated with tanner idols.<br><br>It&#39;s like, it&#39;s fine to have your fair skin preference but like don&#39;t make it seem like it is the ONLY feature that is considered beautiful or widely accepted in a person.<br><br>What do you guys think?; YASS THANK U FOR THIS 20 MINUTE VIDEO, I WAS SO BORED; I remember Taehyung apologized for getting tanned while filming his drama. That&#39;s why whitewashing needs to stop-idols should know their natural skin colour is beautiful and they don&#39;t need to have pale skin!!; I&#39;m glad Kai embraces his tanned skin. I remember he said he doesn&#39;t have plans to become paler. He&#39;s important representation and a great role model for fellow asians. ❤️❤️❤️; Ok about white washing, i used to be insecure about my brown(tan) skin color because my mom and my sister had a lighter skin tone than mine . Whenever they come out after shower their faces look lighter and cleaner. So i thought maybe the solution was soap and i have tried rubbing soap to look lighter (smh to my 13 year old self) . Later i got to know why i have this color as i got more knowledge about Genetics (i am a med student) and i realized that i had the skin tone of my mom and dad(who has a dark skin tone) and that my sister got the skin tone gene from my mother more. In the end , skin tone is because of genes not because you are dirty or anything . And all skin colors are pretty.; honestly I understand why people were worried about somi (the mean and insulting comments are of course not okay) but somi never appeared as thin as her latest comeback and she said multiple times that it was sometimes hard for her to diet (remember that she has been told her entire teenage years that she should diet by her company and by the toxic beauty standards). She said that she ate 3 bananas a day to diet so honestly with all of these informations I understand why people were worried. Now that she said on a live recently that she is eating healthy I think everyone should stop commenting about her weight and how they are worried for her because I think if she was dieting hard she understood (with people worrying about her) that she shouldn&#39;t go lower her weight even more!; Wait can someone tell me who that was who called ji hyo a weightlifter????; <b>the way people normalize these is-</b>; Wow this video popped up right when I was looking at whitewashed ateez photos; what goes into people’s heads that makes them think that talking about someone’s weight okay?<br><br>unless the person being mentioned talks about their weight and is willing to have a conversation about it, then don’t talk about it. it’s literally that simple.<br><br>and how does someone’s weight affect their talent?<br>exactly, it doesn’t. <br>why do we listen to our faves? bc of their music.<br><br>you can be any weight and still put out great music.; My heart broke for Jihyo. She&#39;s such a sweet girl.; That thumbnail tho 👌; In my opinion skinny shaming is as bad as fat shaming , cause i have a skinny body type and i have been skinny shamed by my own relatives . The most insulting one was my relatives saying i look like a stick when i was 9 or 10 and asked me to eat more. As i grew up i thought i had some kind of eating disorder or disease because my sister and my parents both have normal body type while i had skinny one. Even my friends unintentionally talk about how &quot;bony&quot; i am which also was a reason i had those kind of thought. Now i got to know about body shaming and that there are people like who have the same experience as me.; Compared to korean and Chinese people (mostly idols and actors), Japanese people are not ashamed of their natural skin color, they don&#39;t whitewash themselves. And they look way natural and beautiful; You! Yes you!! You should stop caring about everyone&#39;s opinion, they can have their own opinion of course but at least they should not hurt other people with it. Stop caring about what people say about you. You are beautiful in your own way, if people don&#39;t like what they see they should just look away. Stop hurting other people&#39;s feelings.; Toxic kpop fans be setting unrealistic beauty standards on idols but they can’t even achieve that themselves.; Jihyo looked so good in the thumbnail Dayum. If she&#39;s fat imagine me; About me:<br>Im Asian who is tanned skin and skinny, people always tell how &quot;im so dark&quot;, Yes im tanned because im South Indian, and for skinny IM BORN SKINNY. Im like this because im Dravidian with a bit of Burmese Blood. <br><br>And for plastic surgery: It&#39;s ok to have it. Some are forced while some might want to have to, you should never shame them, normalize plastic surgery, Im a huge blink and its kinda obvious that Lisa has plastic surgery (My bias wrecker is Lisa don&#39;t kill me) but if she wanted to get it, we should be ok with it and respect her decisions.<br>I wanna get a nose surgery when i get older; So I do agree with every point that you made, I just wanted to add something. Even if the idols called fat are not fat, saying that &quot;they&#39;re not even fat&quot; makes it sound like being fat is a bad thing. We do have to take into consideration that some people&#39;s bodies are made that way, and while it isn&#39;t the beauty standard being fat is not the same as being obese ( since you mentioned you do not promote obesity) I&#39;ve met plenty of people that are on the bigger side that are way healthier than me, if that&#39;s what you wanted to get at. I know everything you said came from a good place and you didn&#39;t mean anything malicious but I just wanted to let you know that you could&#39;ve worded that a little bit better. Anywaaay, love your videos. Take care &lt;3; I hate it when ppl call someone fat and when they finnally loose weight and happy for that they start calling them skinny ?<br>Do these ppl know how much difficult it is gain or loose weight by putting effort ?🙄; the worst part is they would get so much hate for their appearance if they dont fit the standards which forces them to get work done; Hey❤❤😎; Wow im kinda

Why You Look Better In The Mirror?,QOVES Studio,2023-05-26T12:22:46Z,Personalized step-by-step beauty advice: https://www.qoves.com/services/ Follow the brand across platforms for new content: ...,dxSRtHgD3OU,"Ok the but the last one was clearly a filter. No one looks that different and she looked like a different woman; She looks like film cooper; I look great in the mirror or if someone photographs me<br>but on selifes i look like my nose is 10x bigger and my forehead is huuuuge<br>also very slim face and i’m always like who the hell is this?<br>then i look back in the mirror and every part of my face looks just fine; Wish phones could use larger focal lengths.; My face symetry or asymmetrical 😭; it took me 15 years to finally get comfortable looking at myself in the mirror… and now i realize thats not even how i look to others!! I LOOK WORSE APPARENTLY 😭 now i gotta restart; In the mirror We saw ourselves in 2D , while in real life people saw us in 3D same goes for camera. Camera resolutions are low compared to the lens in our eyes.; My valid ID picture be like:; But does anyone else have a crooked nose that looks straight in the mirror and crooked in the camera 😢; Zoomers now need to be taught about mirrors...<br>and i just woke up from a vivid dystopian nightmare too.; Why did the first girl look better in the zoomed in photo; I’m so insecure bc I have a problem, can someone help? Basically when I look in the mirror I look normal, but when I look in the back camera my face looks really skinny (in a bad way) and I asked my friend and she said I do look really skinny but my body looks normal. Idk why bc my other friend weighs less than me and is taller and my friends tell me my face looks skinnier. I’m so insecure about it and idk what to do. Also my face shape is kinda a triangle and I want  it to be a bit straighter and the part close to my ears upwards if you know what I mean. (I’m sorry I don’t know how to explain that.) but if you have any help for any of the problems please give me solutions!; Who is the last girl?; So i was right and the earth was always flat lol😅; Me personally I wouldn’t date a bartender/worker/ club workers , policemen or train guards and paramedics yeah. I’d probably prefer dating a surfer guy or skater or sports player etc I feel like they’re more laidback, maybe because I’m young I wanna date fit adventurous guys and don’t date older guys yet; I hope every human beings&#39; vision always sees everyone&#39;s face  that &quot;beautiful&quot; way. :); Why are you saying &quot;what makes a zoomed in face look better?&quot;<br><br>Isn&#39;t it zoomed...out? That looks better?; Camera lies; Name of intro song?; One thing I don&#39;t understand is how pictures make my face wider. It looks horrible, like a balloon! My face looks wider, rounder and my lips look flatter and smaller. Whereas in the mirror I don&#39;t look like that. And I know that I don&#39;t have such a big and round face so idk what&#39;s happening but it makes me insecure as fuck; I look better on some phones than others; You need at least 35mm to take close ups, if you use shorter than that, you will look messier; Mirror is the closest you’ll ever get to seeing what you really look like. People will say it’s not cause it’s inverted but that doesn’t matter. Take a pic of a sunset or a starry sky and unless it’s a good camera the picture will come out awful. Look at a sunset in a mirror and it’s just as beautiful. People are too hung up on the inverted bs; I took a pic of myself and then showed it to my cousin, then showed my face to her in the mirror and asked how do i look, she said i look like the picture ?!?!? The google is lying? The researchs are false?!?$? Someone explain?; Watch the girl at the end go from a 6 to a 10 in real time; Seriously? I freakin hate how I look in the mirror. Lol.; What is the app?; Even with this information, a selfie will still humble my phone right back into my pocket. 😞; they look the same just in different perspectives?? why would anyone be surprised or bothered by this don&#39;t we all have eyes; The reason these trends are blowing up is also because of the demographics...like the Gen Z are probably one of the most confused generation who just wants to belong somewhere in this consumerist world where the trends change every other day . The sense of belonging these quote unquote &quot;cliques&quot; give relives a kind of anxiety which otherwise prevails because thoughts like &quot;everyone is successful or prettier except ME&quot; makes one feel like they need to be of a certain type to be perceived and accepted.; THAT DUDE WAS HUMAN SHREK 😭😭; I absolutely look different in pictures and mirror. I just don&#39;t know why! Like, in the mirror I actually see the expression I&#39;m making perfectly well. In pictures it comes weird and awkward, with one eye bent or smaller and the lips twisted in this asymmetrical manner like- that&#39;s not how i see it in the mirror.; I have ALWAYS been unphotogenic.<br>It takes effort to get a picture that is an actual reflection of what I actually look like. But my sister is very photogenic, it takes her no effort to get a great picture of herself.<br>That is because our face shapes and surfaces (for lack of a better word, are different) she has a wide, heart shaped face that is flat (i.e. softer, less defined cheeks and a flat forehead) while my face is not wide, oval and my forehead and cheeks curve, are more defined. <br>I once read an article that explained why some faces are photogenic while others are not and it stated that people with wider, flat faces are more photogenic than those who don’t have those features. And it has to do with the way camera lens interpret those features.; I&#39;m confused you were saying that we look better up close and then at the end you said as she stepped away her face looked better?; Camera lenses: eeeee hehehehhehe; Basically you start looking like a Somali except the  protruding ass forhead; 50-55mm is the closest to what our eyes &quot;focal length&quot; is; I actually look good in both, I&#39;m not the only one right?; I have a question do people see my face like i saw on the morror  ? The same like i saw on the morror?; bro my lower jaw goes to the left in photos😂<br>while i have the sharpest jawline in the mirror; What the heck who&#39;s the last girl?

Her eyes or something… idk what filter she had on but it wasn’t doing her any favors; still looks horrible in the mirror and in further away pics; The only accurate way to see how you truly look like is to put 2 mirrors at an angle of about 85 degrees of each other. Then stand look the image created by the angle and that’s the real you.; What in the hell; Focal length.; So that is why my nose looked big asf on the photos in real life it is small; Me in mirror-👁️.   🐽.     👁️.       <br>                               👄<br>In photos - 👁️.   👃.     👁️<br>                             👄; Or, we could start hiring portrait artists and start a Renaissance.; Oh, thank goodness.; Me looking like a goblin in mirror as well :; The mirror is the &quot;real one&quot; but also you look a lot more similar to the mirror in pictures to other people, you just notice the subtle differences more than they do because you pay more attention. But you&#39;re not ugly if you&#39;re not ugly in the mirror lol; So its bascially better to stay away 2 metere away from people we want to attract and never be to close face to face 😂? Of a human eye does not work like a Lens and we actually do look the same ?😮; I look so beautiful in the mirror but an elephant in back cameras; हाए गर्मी 🥵💀🥵; Bro I can’t even look at the mirror, I’m that fuckin ugly; That last girl went from a 5 to a 9.; When you turn your camera on to take a picture of something <br>But it&#39;s facing you and you weren&#39;t prepared for it. 😂; I look absolutely shocking in both😂; Use a selfie stick; I look unsightly in both; That chicks eyes are scary and beautiful at the same time.; My nose looke fat in the mirror and my cheeks look fat in the camera 😢😂; Me in mirror:✨(European version of Jisoo)<br>Me in camera:🙉💩👽; When watch over how I much changes gotten after some photos or selfies captured turns me to be an anti self captured, until I joined a band and knows how good is memories, it makes me don&#39;t want to regret tons of moments will fades vainly. We know today camera is easily accessible just grateful for it.; i like myself only on close-up photos. when i move away from camera, my head becomes big and features like eyes, lips, small. i’m glad many people realise that they look better irl, but i’m not one of them xdxd; Use selfie camera as mirror. Lol.; Mirror lying to us; Attack on Titan; I look like a peanut in a selfie 😂; Nice, thanks for this info. I look weird in pictures; When you&#39;re ugly but you&#39;re also asymmetrical💀; So where are the filters to compensate for this?; I always wonder why that girl looked like monkeh in pictures, but in person she&#39;s stunningly beautiful like she&#39;s glowing in my eyes.<br>I&#39;ve seen someone also with a really cute nose, but in pictures it looked big.<br>There are really photogenic and the oposite of it where they looked uglier but stunning in person. 💀; so all we need now is a mirror that takes screenshots 🤞🏻; Explain why does everyone look the same way in photos as they do in real life but I look like a chewed up cheeseburger? <b>Asking for a friend…</b>; Filter name?; Which filter is this??; I look so bad without filters when i open snapchat no matter what pose i do; I prefer my mirror image. It’s weird though bc I look good before I take the picture but it’s awful once it’s taken 😂; Which one is the real one ?; So we trust the mirror. Good,good; i envy people who look good in camera, they would look really good in mirror; A lot of these people still look pretty in both, just the camera gave them long faces and short faces; What if look the miro bad and look The inside of the phone is beautiful; The second guy at the start of the video looks like human Shrek 💀; That why oval faces are in trend because whether its low mm or high it doesn&#39;t change there face shape. That&#39;s why we see people with big and giant chins in film industry while they look strange in real and people with round or full face looks fatty or disproportionate in films but in real they are cute and attractive; this literally makes my nose look HUMONGOUS and its so annoying, i have a wide nose already like i dont need it to be any wider 😭😭; I dont like using my front cam. It makes my face slimmer but longer. I always use the back cam cause my face looks round like irl. If my video/pic is mirrored like how it is on tiktok I always flip it back to normal so i dont get used to it.; No wonder I look like 5x fatter in pics; I look terrible on camera but good in the mirror ...its all about the angles i guess; Explains why ever picture I take off our beautiful moon looks crap; THEY LOOK GOOD BOTH WAYS; EXTERNAL LIMITATIONS OF PLANNING <br><br>1.

What Koreans Think of K-pop and Plastic Surgery | ASIAN BOSS,Asian Boss,2017-04-11T07:17:39Z,"A recent music video by a female K-pop group called ""Six Bomb"" caused a lot of controversy in the Western media: ...",VAkwPJhZAxs,"If you enjoyed listening to people&#39;s perspectives (and hopefully learned something), hit subscribe and we will keep bringing you the most authentic social news and stories from Asia. Thanks everybody!; i&#39;m handsome, at least my grandma said that and already enough.; Its disgustjng that harmful plastic surgery become normal stuff for korea🤮🤬😡🤢 people should just study knowledge biology geography, math, and a little music,😡🤢 but harmful plastic surgert is not and should not be normal; I’m not Korean. When I see a Korean, I didn’t even think they have big faces or big heads or anything. I mean that feature doesn’t stand out that much since Koreans are generally tall, so it’s naturally for them to have big heads or faces proportionally to their bodies. It was later I learned that they are made to believe their faces are too big. Nah it’s not. They look good to me as a foreigner.; When I feel that the beautiful appearance is used for the job I ask myself:<br>Do Korean companies look for efficient employees or beautiful appetizers?; I am dutch. I like double eyelids. If they are done via plastic surgery the woman look like they have fish eyes and look surprised 24/ why. Also.... Do not bleach your face. Korean skin colour is beautifull.; Plastic surgery creates a doubt like whether a kid is mine or not; it&#39;s not that we think all koreans do plastic surgery, but we assume all korean celebrities do it, which creates an unrealistic beauty standard for viewers and I think for many korean teenagers too. Another thing that also bothers me is they always use brightening filter to edit or white wash faces in dramas, or pictures of kpop idols taken by fans; That is so stupid; Its nice to see real people that does not look likes they are computer generated; This looks like SNU stationnn, my uni :o; it&#39;s nice to see normal looking koreans. I got so used to koreans in  Kdramas that all look like eachother and could pass as siblings 😅 .; it wouldn&#39;t be a problem if it was not such widespread and in many cases forced. Also because of their too high beauty standards.; North Korean are real Korean; &quot;Where is that line?&quot; &quot;When you become unrecognizable&quot; 😂😂; Btw, the guy with gray jacket and guy with yellow t-shirt are handsome and sure they dont need any surgery; I am 30 year old and i never use any face cream or any face wash and shampoo only shop😅; 유감스럽지만 내 주변에 쌍꺼풀 수술을 받은 사람은 단 두 명뿐이고, 선천적인 쌍꺼풀이나 홑꺼풀을 가진 사람이 훨씬 더 많다. 우리 이모와 고모는 혼혈이 아님에도 태어날 때부터 서구적인 외모였다. 우리 오빠는 쌍꺼풀이 있는데 그것은 가끔씩 홑꺼풀이 되기도 한다.<br>물론 한국 사회가 높은 외모 기준을 요구하는 경향이 있는 것은 사실이다. 하지만 생각보다 자신의 외모 때문에 스트레스를 받는 한국인들이 많지 않다. 흥미로운 점은 주변을 둘러보면 외모에 집착하거나 외모 때문에 취업에 불이익을 받을 것을 걱정하는 사람이 거의 없다는 점이다. 많은 사람들이 다양한 스타일링을 즐기고 자신만의 개성을 사랑한다. 그리고 나는 여러분들이 인스타그램을 보는 것이 현재의 한국 문화를 정확하게 파악하기 더 쉬울 거라고 생각한다.<br>서양인들은 작고 홑꺼풀에 넓은 얼굴이 한국인의 기본적인 외모라고 생각할 수 있지만, 많은 한국인들은 다양한 외모를 가지고 있다. 쌍커풀의 모양도 사람마다 다 다르게 생겼다. 그리고 서양 문화가 들어오기 훨씬 전부터, 하얀 피부, 높은 코, 그리고 큰 눈 또는 쌍꺼풀이 있는 눈은 아름다움의 기준으로 여겨졌다. 댓글을 보면 외모의 기준뿐만 아니라 세계의 중심이 서양인이라고 생각하는 사람들이 있는 것 같다. 하얗고 쌍꺼풀을 가진 한국인보고 무조건 성형을 한 얼굴이며 백인을 동경한다고 하는 것은 인종차별로 볼 수 있다. 그렇게 말하는 사람들은 곱슬머리를 빳빳하게 피거나 입술 필러를 하고 엉덩이를 크게 키우는 것에도 똑같이 지적할 수 있어야 한다.; It&#39;s interesting how they keep saying it&#39;s their choice when later questions revealed that it is in fact societal pressure after all... just shows how prevalent this beauty pressure really is there; Hmm most insecure people in whole universe. 😒; Plastic surgery is fine, but to erase ethnic features is weird.. because plastic surgery won&#39;t change the genes of those ethnic features and if you have Children, they&#39;ll be passed on.; Thank God I&#39;m Indian and we&#39;re not judged by way we looks; Plastic surgery is prevalent in Korea because the majority of people there have Korean features (broad  flat face and nose) and that’s not considered beautiful in the West or by them. They are a self-hating society. So sad.; These were really interesting questions &amp; interesting answers! Thanks!; This is exactly the same reaction as when I asked Japanese people about anime.; its such a nuanced topic. like yes we can say, &quot;oh this procedure would make me so much more confident&quot;. but I think, if i grew up on an island away from society, would I still care? so is it really my OWN choice and desire to get plastic surgery? its an interesting thing to think about; ပြန်ရင်နဂါမုဘုုဖုမ်းကိုးးးးးနတ်မောက်ဘုတ်ပြင်မြိုမဲဖြစ်ဖောက်ကးးးးးပေလှူခဲပါစေးးးးးမိုကုတ်မဟာစည်လိုးးးးကုတ်လုံးးးးးမစးးးးးကဟးးးးး၁၆ဂဏါန်အရးးးးးအဝိစိးးကုသိုလ်ရဒယ်ခင်ဗျးးးမေဖြေပါခင်ဗျပေလှူခဲရင်ခင်ဗျးးးးးဖုမ်ထည်မှသူတူကြိုက်ကျိုက်ဒယ်တရာဓမ္မာသံလေနာထောင်ရင်ထာဝရပါးးးးပျော်စိတ်ဖြစ်သိချင်ဖြစ်လည်သူသာချစ်မုန်သူသာဆက်သွယ်ရင်လည်ထာဝရးးးကျန်မာရေအတွက်ဆ​ိုရှိူသျှိူလည်းးးးထာဝရးးးးးးကျန်မာရေပညာညဏ်ကုသိုလ်းးးးပါခင်ဗျးးးးးးလူစုံပါသံဃာလည်ပါဒယ်ဂိတသာဂိဖျော်ဖြေရခင်ဗျးးလာနာထောင်ဒယ်မအခါးးးရေဒါ်စာမိမိကျိုင်ရင်သိချင်ရုပ်သျှင်ရိုက်လိုရဒယ်ခင်ဗျးးးးးလာသံဃာပါရမိးးးပြန်တောနဂါမုဘူဖုမ်းးးးးအကုသိုလ်းးးကုသိုလ်းးးးးအဂ္ဂါဝရးးးးဂ္ဂါဝရးးးးပါခင်ဗျးးးးး; Before watching kdrama and k-pop i really thought all Koreans Chinese and Japanese look same and look beautiful but now I they are tending not to look same and look more beautiful....there is nothing we can stop learning about world; Where I live .. I would be judged if I ever ask for plastic surgery  .... ppl here believe there are many other things to do than to look just PRETTY!; But everyone in this video looks so handsome and pretty as well they are so beautiful just look at their clothing style it&#39;s just wow....; I like how they care so much about what western people think, it&#39;s almost like they want western people to accept them.; Never knew Koreans go through surgery for double eyelids. Most of the people in my country have it naturally 😅; Outside Korea in another Asian country, I&#39;ve heard senior engineers say half in jest or maybe not, that they want to hire the prettier candidate (who also smiled more).<br><br>Therefore, society is responsible for these values.<br><br>Some of these interviewees have already imbibed such values, so they admit that going under the knife gives them a more competitive edge in society.<br><br>Depressing reality.; ppl watch kpop bc they r hot dont lie<br>and thats similar to many entertainment industrirs; If no Korean had plastic surgery, there would be no K-POP idol.; As a Korean woman in my mid-20s, I find it funny that people from other cultures talk about &quot;natural monolid Asian eyes&quot;.  It is true that many Koreans prefer to have double eyelids, but not all.  And in my experience, at least half of Koreans are born with double eyelids.  Therefore, the comment &quot;monolid is the natural Korean eye&quot; sounds pretty racist to me.  There are many people who think that both monolid and double eyelids are unique beauty.  There are a lot of acquaintances around me who have monolid eyes, and they don&#39;t want PS.  Of the many friends I have made while living in Korea for over 20 years, only 5 have had double eyelid surgery, and no one else has had a bigger surgery like the nose or chin.  Most of my acquaintances have jobs and work.  And I&#39;ve never actually met anyone who had plastic surgery for a job.  To be honest, most of the Korean in this video did not have PS.  K-pop idols and celebrities are a special case, and ordinary people are not like them.  I wonder that foreigners who say that most Koreans look alike have stayed in Korea for even one day.  I don&#39;t want to rate them, but from my point of view I can see that people from many cultures have had plastic surgery done according to their beauty standards.  Those are big breasts and hips, cheekbones, and thick lips.  If you want to say that most of these are for celebrities, that&#39;s what I mean. From my point of view, it seems unnatural for a person with curly hair to stick to straight hair, dye their lashes black and put on fake false lashes, tanning their natural skin color, heavy makeup, and Brazilian waxing.  It is clear that everyone has different standards of beauty in their respective cultures and cares about their appearance.<br>I&#39;m not saying that Koreans don&#39;t have plastic surgery.  Korea is a country with advanced PS, and I think that the number of people who do PS is not small.  Appearanceism also exists. (Recently, this has emerged as a big social problem in Korea as well, and I hope it will change.) Howsoever, Korea&#39;s plastic surgery figures include the number of foreigners who come to Korea to perform PS.  And I want to point out the fact that most people don&#39;t do plastic surgery pathologically like the exaggerated information on the Internet.  I have both monolid and double eyelids, and I&#39;m not as skinny as a K-pop star, but I never thought of getting PS because I thought I&#39;m beautiful.  The same goes for most of my acquaintances.  I hope that appearanceism, attitudes to evaluate other cultures without studying or understanding, and prejudices disappear!🙏; south koreans really dont want to be judge abt their plastic thing or their choice, in simple words they want respect but on the other part they hate black or brown complexion xd!! esp southeast asian countries. they r really looking down on the ppl of that countries. even the accents, way of life, etc. they think they r superior now as kpop goes bigger n bigger. little they did now they also have a lot disappointments and flaws, im not gonna talk abt that cause i know u know.; I think Korea pops artists should learn makeups skills from Japan !; I think kpop sucks; tbh,Iam from India.People look at your talent and looks don&#39;t matter here; Very smart questions and answers! Thank you for this video; I&#39;m not korean but when I got into K-pop culture I started comparing my weight, body and skin to Idols bodies. And honestly I developed some insecurities. But the good part is that I started to exercise more and eat healthier foods. So I wouldn&#39;t say that Korean/Japanese culture ruined my self-esteem because when I started researching why Koreans and Japanese are so skinny was because of their lifestyle, I realized that I ate a lot of things that weren&#39;t good for  my body. So in part, I&#39;m grateful.; TV is the culprit, if you see the &#39;beautiful people&#39; and you don&#39;t think you are one of them,  you might use alternative methods to become like them. Its like a permanent make up. Careful though because fashions change and what was beautiful 10 years ago, may not be beautiful in 10 years time. Also , I wonder how plastic surgery alters a persons aging looks. I remember an American actor called tony curtis who had a very boyish ,pretty face but when he was old, he looked like a distorted patchwork because of all the surgeries to preserve his looks.; Wish i could have chance to do the interview. Most of them exaggerated the situation in korea.. only few ppl talk about getting plastic sugery and those ppl are mostly teenagers and they say it never seriously but just as one of many gossips. Getting surgery to get a job..🤦‍♀️ it became even in korea a news that such thing exist. Most ppl didn&#39;t even know that exists. I have never seen in my life someone getting it for a job interview; Where just ugly that we need the power of plastic..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Maybe thats what u think; These days they will do everything just to be pretty but pretty is nothing God make us and they hate themselves God will not happy; 한국인인데도 여자들 저렇게 쌍꺼풀 시술 수준으로 한다는건 몰랐네;; Nowadays most of the indian kpop fan girls love korea and kpop idols so much actually obsession will be more suitable. They degrade indian musicians and dancers and praise kpop idols and kpop. In some (3 to 4)of the indian songs there are just 2 to 3 sec tune similar to kpop that too 2 or 3 sec only in TUNE ,That those obsessed girls put it as indians or bollywood  copy kpop. And there are videos like kpop and bollywood songs similar. That they put it as SIMILAR because bollywood was the first to release it. And when kpop have similar in english songs then they says it is  inspired that too these indians are watching, i said this because people name with shivani ,lakshmi were commented those comments. This is the exact reason why I said INDIAN KPOP FANS ARE JUST OBSESED GIRLS. They even says they want to live in Korea and they shouldn&#39;t have born in India. I said these things by reading tons of comments by those obsessed girls!!!; Who are we to say what is pretty and what is ugly anyway? It&#39;s about being comfortable with oneself and accepting oneself at the end of the day. The conventionally prettiest person may still feel insecure and the most conventionally unattractive person may still feel good about themselves.; Living in the country where physical look is everything; they call it &#39;&#39;culture&#39;&#39; I call it brainwashing; I am glad to be poor, because if i had the means, i&#39;d most likely get work done. My brain would get tricked into it at some point. But i can&#39;t afford it at all and i do not have any debts ( and won&#39;t get any) so my fate has been sealed. Accepting myself is my only choice and i&#39;m grateful for it.; Thank God<br>My favourite actress Zendaya was never born in this country.; How very sad that is? We knew already that many K-Pop Idols and other celebs did undergo plastic surgery to look pretty. What is most sad is that they actually think that look is more important then talent. I always said that Korean K-pop Idols are just fake and with no talent whatsoever.; Help them to grow in peace and not feel obligation to help until they fully understand and embody peace and truth that even the most slimey, lost and bitter in their society cannot  twist or pervert their words.; I see in their eyes they are twisted and confused and bitter and hopeless and dark.  They do not connect with mine. They connect with eachother in the toxic state they are in. They need you God to be given a new balance within themselves. And much patience.; Help the ones who hear your voice find humility, shelter, food and enough to survive as they grow. Help them see who they once were as a stranger.; They are born into a state if hell like confusion around others with hell like confusion. They only way they can free themselves is through YOU God!!!; Please show mercy on those who could not escape the twisted state their parents gave them. Show them YOU are their father!! They do not have to become their parents!!; God PLEASE HELP THESE PEOPLE! I cannot reach them. They will pervert my words. They should not take guidance from a man. Give them your wisdom that they can see the truth in what I say.; They must respect eachother as individuals. Not manipulate through reputation and not let those who manipulate control them and their spirit. They must accept when others mistreat them and carry forward.; They need to be able to admit as a people they are in an inferior state. Through that humility they will have a superior spirit on their journey in evolving as a people and society.; In their own country it is the blind leading the blind.... THESE PEOPLE ARE ALONE! PLEASE GOD HELP THEM FIND YOU!!! SHOW MERCY ON THESE PEOPLE, PLEASE GOD!!; They go to other countries and they are alienated more. Mistreated because they do not understand their energy. Others do not like the confusion they bring.; Why create a twisted human who is alienated from understanding and connecting with others God? It must be for them to be examples that the human state is fluid. That they CAN change!; Help them evolve. There is darkness and sadness in them due to the physical. The mental follows the physical. Help them move inward and learn to open their eyes the same as every other form of humanity.; THESE PEOPLE ARE TORNENTED!! GOD PLEASE HELP THEM!! HEKP THEM BE HUMBLE AND TO FACE ARROGANCE WITH STRENGTH ABD HUMILITY!; These people are so lost they don&#39;t understand they don&#39;t want the appearance of double eyelids. They want the physical, spiritual state of having their eyes open that way.; Their brain is swollen, overactive. Their body cold. Turn off the brain and accept the physical state and emotion and open eyes by moving inward at the corners  in toward the body.; These people bear more pain and mental anguish than any other people I believe.; They have no true respect of the spirit that exists in their body. Only their ego and the ego of others. God please help these people especially the children.; Watch how they walk. Their mid sections and gentetakia move in a way that us violent, almost angry, and disrespectful to their body. They lead with anxious minds.; In turn their physical state causes a twisted morality that is about appearing and sounding nice, but having no real connection or grounding of peace or balance in the body.; It all has to do with the neck, jaw, and shoulder why their eyes are small and detached. Has nothing to do with their eyes.; In their state their sexual energy is dark instead of respectful and balanced within the body. The head is a part of the body. Their heads lean forward and detach.; They are confused because they lead with their mind and not their chin and sexual energy. Why did God do this? I do not understand. I am half korean, I used to look like them now I do not. I look hispanic and fan grow a beard.; I would not have children if I were korean &quot;looking&quot;. The look reflects a loss of physical awareness and grip on the eyes and face in connection with the body.; They are many levels of twisted from other forms of humanity.; Korean people are in trouble if they don&#39;t evolve. I&#39;m half korean. They are so trapped in their minds they don&#39;t realize their physical and spiritual state can change.; I feel pity for Korean society 😔; This make me so sad for some reason :(; Thank you for your videos.; <b>No one is realizing this but Korea is such a messed up society. Over there you literally have a higher chance of getting a job if you look pretty. Even if you don&#39;t look pretty/handsome but have the skills you still have a low chance! 🙄Like why should you look pretty/handsome for the job, the skills matters it&#39;s not like you are getting paid just because you look pretty/handsome. Also koreans (not all) focus on their outer beauty too much they should instead focus on their inner beauty. They spend large amounts of money just to get these stupid cosmetic surgeries. They aren&#39;t appreciating their unique beauty and all Koreans would end up looking the same if they all do surgery. I feel so bad for those Koreans who feel embarrassed about their country. I&#39;m so grateful I was not born in that messed up country</b>; I wonder how they recognize each other <br>Like 6 bomb grp they all look same to me <br>After knowing that many korean undergo plastic surgery <br>I stopped watching kdramas even chinese Dramas <br>Because they made me feel uncomfortable about my looks <br>And even same things happen again and again <br><br> So started watching bollywood movies and (serial like tmkoc)<br>They represent many social problems, moral values,  comedy , dance , music <br>India is just awesome <br>I hope in my second life also <br>I want to be in india <br>I can recommend you many movies like 3 idiots,  dangal , 102 not out , secret superstar,  padman etc; According to korean beauty standards ( having small face,double eyelid,peal colour, Big eyes, st.eyebrow n St. nose and long legs) I know these features are attractive....but if everyone has the same body appearance then is this not a quiet disappointing🙄🙄🙄 imagine a mother has two baby girls and two baby boys having exact same facial features 😂😂😂🤞 ahh thnk god there&#39;s no STD for hairstyles too otherwise we&#39;ll get confused by hairstyles too 😂; Why you guys do plastic surgery..? Its a hereditary traits from your mom and dad... So you should preserve your natural beauty given by your mom and dad.... Its so difficult to distinguish kpop idols face.....like i get confused who is who.... See i can distinguish selena and ariana.... Buyt cannot distinguish kpop idol.. They look so similar... In my country everyone has got double eyelids... But wats the point of having it... You can see these colourful world even wid single eyelids... So please stop... You all look beautiful the way you are...; There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a plastic surgery, but its kinda sad to see how most of them felt pressured and felt the need to fit in the beauty standards.; Interestingly, everybody in this video interview already has a nice face.  Would have been interesting if an objectively homely* person had answered questions.<br>I realize that as an outsider I can&#39;t possibly know the beauty standard people are chasing when they go for plastic surgery in other countries.  Here in the US people are crazy about lip injections, Botox in the forehead, or my favorite, those veneers so white they&#39;re almost blue.  I see those same people in historical movies and it annoys me to no end.  Dude, in the Wild West,  nobody had shiny white teeth, let alone many teeth at all by adulthood.  I get a similar effect when I watch Korean dramas set before the advent of plastic surgery and people in historical costume and the nose bridge implant thing are in prominent roles.  I guess any cosmetic surgery makes suspension of disbelief that much more challenging.  :-o; A lot of Koreans “seem” to have plastic surgery, but it’s statistics. SO many foreigners come to Korea just to get plastic surgery. Mostly from China, Vietnam, Thai, et cetera. Just in year 2015, fifty-six thousand Chinese people came to Korea just to get plastic surgery. But because statistics only consider the “number” of surgeries conducted in Korea, people often get mistaken.<br><br>This video make it seem like half the Korean population get plastic surgery, but it’s similar to any other countries. It’s stereotypes. <br><br>Nonetheless, I do agree many Koreans feel insecure and care about their looks a lot. That’s why fashion, cosmetics, and skin care is a thing in Korea.; If you want to change something in your body or face, it is important not to change what is your good personality and your heart because I believe what is important is not physical appearance. CAUSE  IT IS VITAL NOT PHYSICAL.; But Korean Beauty is Fake. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>North Korea is a Natural Beauty of Korea. 🇰🇵; 한국 기준이 높은건 맞고 나도 문제가 있다고 생각하는데 무쌍인 눈과 노란 피부를 한국인의 특성이라고 생각하는게 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ; They sound like members of some cult; Korea is all about look even with its high development korea is kinda toxic; I personally don&#39;t like &#39;asian&#39; eyes, but that&#39;s just my opinion. It&#39;s so sad that even korean parents force their daughters to get surgery.; Get plastic surgery for yourself and not others. Simple; IDOLS ..KDRAMA ACTORS..MODELS this people live from their looks and talent ..but do I have to be pretty or good looking in order to get  the job that I want cuz everybody is highly educated in Korea? and been good looking is one of the requirements .?!!What kind of bullying is that? Remember that NO ONE CAN MAKE YOU INFERIOR WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT...; Beauty lies in one&#39;s vision not in the subject. Appreciating our own beauty is an art and respect our parents and God and most importantly to ourselves. Maintaing is good but totally changing it&#39;s just shows how foolish  you r for accepting others opinions rather that yourselves. <br>People wants to be modern but they don&#39;t have the courage to accept the truth and not judging each other! Do at all ur life, waste ur life judging each other rather than contributing to humanity.; I&#39;ve never find Korean attractive that&#39;s it..; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAkwPJhZAxs&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> who  heard rosè😂😂😂💜or is only me🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️","What Koreans Think of K-pop and Plastic Surgery | ASIAN BOSS A recent music video by a female K-pop group called ""Six Bomb"" caused a lot of controversy in the Western media: ...

Also because of their too high beauty standards.; North Korean are real Korean; &quot;Where is that line?&quot; &quot;When you become unrecognizable&quot; 😂😂; Btw, the guy with gray jacket and guy with yellow t-shirt are handsome and sure they dont need any surgery; I am 30 year old and i never use any face cream or any face wash and shampoo only shop😅; 유감스럽지만 내 주변에 쌍꺼풀 수술을 받은 사람은 단 두 명뿐이고, 선천적인 쌍꺼풀이나 홑꺼풀을 가진 사람이 훨씬 더 많다. 우리 이모와 고모는 혼혈이 아님에도 태어날 때부터 서구적인 외모였다. 우리 오빠는 쌍꺼풀이 있는데 그것은 가끔씩 홑꺼풀이 되기도 한다.<br>물론 한국 사회가 높은 외모 기준을 요구하는 경향이 있는 것은 사실이다. 하지만 생각보다 자신의 외모 때문에 스트레스를 받는 한국인들이 많지 않다. 흥미로운 점은 주변을 둘러보면 외모에 집착하거나 외모 때문에 취업에 불이익을 받을 것을 걱정하는 사람이 거의 없다는 점이다. 많은 사람들이 다양한 스타일링을 즐기고 자신만의 개성을 사랑한다. 그리고 나는 여러분들이 인스타그램을 보는 것이 현재의 한국 문화를 정확하게 파악하기 더 쉬울 거라고 생각한다.<br>서양인들은 작고 홑꺼풀에 넓은 얼굴이 한국인의 기본적인 외모라고 생각할 수 있지만, 많은 한국인들은 다양한 외모를 가지고 있다. 쌍커풀의 모양도 사람마다 다 다르게 생겼다. 그리고 서양 문화가 들어오기 훨씬 전부터, 하얀 피부, 높은 코, 그리고 큰 눈 또는 쌍꺼풀이 있는 눈은 아름다움의 기준으로 여겨졌다. 댓글을 보면 외모의 기준뿐만 아니라 세계의 중심이 서양인이라고 생각하는 사람들이 있는 것 같다. 하얗고 쌍꺼풀을 가진 한국인보고 무조건 성형을 한 얼굴이며 백인을 동경한다고 하는 것은 인종차별로 볼 수 있다. 그렇게 말하는 사람들은 곱슬머리를 빳빳하게 피거나 입술 필러를 하고 엉덩이를 크게 키우는 것에도 똑같이 지적할 수 있어야 한다.; It&#39;s interesting how they keep saying it&#39;s their choice when later questions revealed that it is in fact societal pressure after all... just shows how prevalent this beauty pressure really is there; Hmm most insecure people in whole universe. 😒; Plastic surgery is fine, but to erase ethnic features is weird.. because plastic surgery won&#39;t change the genes of those ethnic features and if you have Children, they&#39;ll be passed on.; Thank God I&#39;m Indian and we&#39;re not judged by way we looks; Plastic surgery is prevalent in Korea because the majority of people there have Korean features (broad  flat face and nose) and that’s not considered beautiful in the West or by them. They are a self-hating society. So sad.; These were really interesting questions &amp; interesting answers! Thanks!; This is exactly the same reaction as when I asked Japanese people about anime.; its such a nuanced topic. like yes we can say, &quot;oh this procedure would make me so much more confident&quot;. but I think, if i grew up on an island away from society, would I still care? so is it really my OWN choice and desire to get plastic surgery? its an interesting thing to think about; ပြန်ရင်နဂါမုဘုုဖုမ်းကိုးးးးးနတ်မောက်ဘုတ်ပြင်မြိုမဲဖြစ်ဖောက်ကးးးးးပေလှူခဲပါစေးးးးးမိုကုတ်မဟာစည်လိုးးးးကုတ်လုံးးးးးမစးးးးးကဟးးးးး၁၆ဂဏါန်အရးးးးးအဝိစိးးကုသိုလ်ရဒယ်ခင်ဗျးးးမေဖြေပါခင်ဗျပေလှူခဲရင်ခင်ဗျးးးးးဖုမ်ထည်မှသူတူကြိုက်ကျိုက်ဒယ်တရာဓမ္မာသံလေနာထောင်ရင်ထာဝရပါးးးးပျော်စိတ်ဖြစ်သိချင်ဖြစ်လည်သူသာချစ်မုန်သူသာဆက်သွယ်ရင်လည်ထာဝရးးးကျန်မာရေအတွက်ဆ​ိုရှိူသျှိူလည်းးးးထာဝရးးးးးးကျန်မာရေပညာညဏ်ကုသိုလ်းးးးပါခင်ဗျးးးးးးလူစုံပါသံဃာလည်ပါဒယ်ဂိတသာဂိဖျော်ဖြေရခင်ဗျးးလာနာထောင်ဒယ်မအခါးးးရေဒါ်စာမိမိကျိုင်ရင်သိချင်ရုပ်သျှင်ရိုက်လိုရဒယ်ခင်ဗျးးးးးလာသံဃာပါရမိးးးပြန်တောနဂါမုဘူဖုမ်းးးးးအကုသိုလ်းးးကုသိုလ်းးးးးအဂ္ဂါဝရးးးးဂ္ဂါဝရးးးးပါခင်ဗျးးးးး; Before watching kdrama and k-pop i really thought all Koreans Chinese and Japanese look same and look beautiful but now I they are tending not to look same and look more beautiful....there is nothing we can stop learning about world; Where I live .. I would be judged if I ever ask for plastic surgery  .... ppl here believe there are many other things to do than to look just PRETTY!; But everyone in this video looks so handsome and pretty as well they are so beautiful just look at their clothing style it&#39;s just wow....; I like how they care so much about what western people think, it&#39;s almost like they want western people to accept them.; Never knew Koreans go through surgery for double eyelids. Most of the people in my country have it naturally 😅; Outside Korea in another Asian country, I&#39;ve heard senior engineers say half in jest or maybe not, that they want to hire the prettier candidate (who also smiled more).<br><br>Therefore, society is responsible for these values.<br><br>Some of these interviewees have already imbibed such values, so they admit that going under the knife gives them a more competitive edge in society.<br><br>Depressing reality.; ppl watch kpop bc they r hot dont lie<br>and thats similar to many entertainment industrirs; If no Korean had plastic surgery, there would be no K-POP idol.; As a Korean woman in my mid-20s, I find it funny that people from other cultures talk about &quot;natural monolid Asian eyes&quot;.  It is true that many Koreans prefer to have double eyelids, but not all.  And in my experience, at least half of Koreans are born with double eyelids.  Therefore, the comment &quot;monolid is the natural Korean eye&quot; sounds pretty racist to me.  There are many people who think that both monolid and double eyelids are unique beauty.  There are a lot of acquaintances around me who have monolid eyes, and they don&#39;t want PS.  Of the many friends I have made while living in Korea for over 20 years, only 5 have had double eyelid surgery, and no one else has had a bigger surgery like the nose or chin.  Most of my acquaintances have jobs and work.  And I&#39;ve never actually met anyone who had plastic surgery for a job.  To be honest, most of the Korean in this video did not have PS.  K-pop idols and celebrities are a special case, and ordinary people are not like them.  I wonder that foreigners who say that most Koreans look alike have stayed in Korea for even one day.  I don&#39;t want to rate them, but from my point of view I can see that people from many cultures have had plastic surgery done according to their beauty standards.  Those are big breasts and hips, cheekbones, and thick lips.  If you want to say that most of these are for celebrities, that&#39;s what I mean. From my point of view, it seems unnatural for a person with curly hair to stick to straight hair, dye their lashes black and put on fake false lashes, tanning their natural skin color, heavy makeup, and Brazilian waxing.  It is clear that everyone has different standards of beauty in their respective cultures and cares about their appearance.<br>I&#39;m not saying that Koreans don&#39;t have plastic surgery.  Korea is a country with advanced PS, and I think that the number of people who do PS is not small.  Appearanceism also exists. (Recently, this has emerged as a big social problem in Korea as well, and I hope it will change.) Howsoever, Korea&#39;s plastic surgery figures include the number of foreigners who come to Korea to perform PS.  And I want to point out the fact that most people don&#39;t do plastic surgery pathologically like the exaggerated information on the Internet.  I have both monolid and double eyelids, and I&#39;m not as skinny as a K-pop star, but I never thought of getting PS because I thought I&#39;m beautiful.  The same goes for most of my acquaintances.  I hope that appearanceism, attitudes to evaluate other cultures without studying or understanding, and prejudices disappear!🙏; south koreans really dont want to be judge abt their plastic thing or their choice, in simple words they want respect but on the other part they hate black or brown complexion xd!! esp southeast asian countries. they r really looking down on the ppl of that countries. even the accents, way of life, etc. they think they r superior now as kpop goes bigger n bigger. little they did now they also have a lot disappointments and flaws, im not gonna talk abt that cause i know u know.; I think Korea pops artists should learn makeups skills from Japan !; I think kpop sucks; tbh,Iam from India.People look at your talent and looks don&#39;t matter here; Very smart questions and answers! Thank you for this video; I&#39;m not korean but when I got into K-pop culture I started comparing my weight, body and skin to Idols bodies. And honestly I developed some insecurities. But the good part is that I started to exercise more and eat healthier foods. So I wouldn&#39;t say that Korean/Japanese culture ruined my self-esteem because when I started researching why Koreans and Japanese are so skinny was because of their lifestyle, I realized that I ate a lot of things that weren&#39;t good for  my body. So in part, I&#39;m grateful.; TV is the culprit, if you see the &#39;beautiful people&#39; and you don&#39;t think you are one of them,  you might use alternative methods to become like them. Its like a permanent make up. Careful though because fashions change and what was beautiful 10 years ago, may not be beautiful in 10 years time. Also , I wonder how plastic surgery alters a persons aging looks. I remember an American actor called tony curtis who had a very boyish ,pretty face but when he was old, he looked like a distorted patchwork because of all the surgeries to preserve his looks.; Wish i could have chance to do the interview. Most of them exaggerated the situation in korea.. only few ppl talk about getting plastic sugery and those ppl are mostly teenagers and they say it never seriously but just as one of many gossips. Getting surgery to get a job..🤦‍♀️ it became even in korea a news that such thing exist. Most ppl didn&#39;t even know that exists. I have never seen in my life someone getting it for a job interview; Where just ugly that we need the power of plastic..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Maybe thats what u think; These days they will do everything just to be pretty but pretty is nothing God make us and they hate themselves God will not happy; 한국인인데도 여자들 저렇게 쌍꺼풀 시술 수준으로 한다는건 몰랐네;; Nowadays most of the indian kpop fan girls love korea and kpop idols so much actually obsession will be more suitable. They degrade indian musicians and dancers and praise kpop idols and kpop. In some (3 to 4)of the indian songs there are just 2 to 3 sec tune similar to kpop that too 2 or 3 sec only in TUNE ,That those obsessed girls put it as indians or bollywood  copy kpop. And there are videos like kpop and bollywood songs similar. That they put it as SIMILAR because bollywood was the first to release it. And when kpop have similar in english songs then they says it is  inspired that too these indians are watching, i said this because people name with shivani ,lakshmi were commented those comments. This is the exact reason why I said INDIAN KPOP FANS ARE JUST OBSESED GIRLS. They even says they want to live in Korea and they shouldn&#39;t have born in India. I said these things by reading tons of comments by those obsessed girls!!!; Who are we to say what is pretty and what is ugly anyway? It&#39;s about being comfortable with oneself and accepting oneself at the end of the day. The conventionally prettiest person may still feel insecure and the most conventionally unattractive person may still feel good about themselves.; Living in the country where physical look is everything; they call it &#39;&#39;culture&#39;&#39; I call it brainwashing; I am glad to be poor, because if i had the means, i&#39;d most likely get work done. My brain would get tricked into it at some point. But i can&#39;t afford it at all and i do not have any debts ( and won&#39;t get any) so my fate has been sealed. Accepting myself is my only choice and i&#39;m grateful for it.; Thank God<br>My favourite actress Zendaya was never born in this country.; How very sad that is? We knew already that many K-Pop Idols and other celebs did undergo plastic surgery to look pretty. What is most sad is that they actually think that look is more important then talent. I always said that Korean K-pop Idols are just fake and with no talent whatsoever.; Help them to grow in peace and not feel obligation to help until they fully understand and embody peace and truth that even the most slimey, lost and bitter in their society cannot  twist or pervert their words.; I see in their eyes they are twisted and confused and bitter and hopeless and dark.  They do not connect with mine. They connect with eachother in the toxic state they are in. They need you God to be given a new balance within themselves. And much patience.; Help the ones who hear your voice find humility, shelter, food and enough to survive as they grow. Help them see who they once were as a stranger.; They are born into a state if hell like confusion around others with hell like confusion. They only way they can free themselves is through YOU God!!!; Please show mercy on those who could not escape the twisted state their parents gave them. Show them YOU are their father!! They do not have to become their parents!!; God PLEASE HELP THESE PEOPLE! I cannot reach them. They will pervert my words. They should not take guidance from a man. Give them your wisdom that they can see the truth in what I say.; They must respect eachother as individuals. Not manipulate through reputation and not let those who manipulate control them and their spirit. They must accept when others mistreat them and carry forward.; They need to be able to admit as a people they are in an inferior state. Through that humility they will have a superior spirit on their journey in evolving as a people and society.; In their own country it is the blind leading the blind.... THESE PEOPLE ARE ALONE! PLEASE GOD HELP THEM FIND YOU!!! SHOW MERCY ON THESE PEOPLE, PLEASE GOD!!; They go to other countries and they are alienated more. Mistreated because they do not understand their energy. Others do not like the confusion they bring.; Why create a twisted human who is alienated from understanding and connecting with others God? It must be for them to be examples that the human state is fluid. That they CAN change!; Help them evolve. There is darkness and sadness in them due to the physical. The mental follows the physical. Help them move inward and learn to open their eyes the same as every other form of humanity.; THESE PEOPLE ARE TORNENTED!! GOD PLEASE HELP THEM!! HEKP THEM BE HUMBLE AND TO FACE ARROGANCE WITH STRENGTH ABD HUMILITY!; These people are so lost they don&#39;t understand they don&#39;t want the appearance of double eyelids. They want the physical, spiritual state of having their eyes open that way.; Their brain is swollen, overactive. Their body cold. Turn off the brain and accept the physical state and emotion and open eyes by moving inward at the corners  in toward the body.; These people bear more pain and mental anguish than any other people I believe.; They have no true respect of the spirit that exists in their body. Only their ego and the ego of others. God please help these people especially the children.; Watch how they walk. Their mid sections and gentetakia move in a way that us violent, almost angry, and disrespectful to their body. They lead with anxious minds.; In turn their physical state causes a twisted morality that is about appearing and sounding nice, but having no real connection or grounding of peace or balance in the body.; It all has to do with the neck, jaw, and shoulder why their eyes are small and detached. Has nothing to do with their eyes.; In their state their sexual energy is dark instead of respectful and balanced within the body. The head is a part of the body. Their heads lean forward and detach.; They are confused because they lead with their mind and not their chin and sexual energy. Why did God do this? I do not understand. I am half korean, I used to look like them now I do not. I look hispanic and fan grow a beard.; I would not have children if I were korean &quot;looking&quot;. The look reflects a loss of physical awareness and grip on the eyes and face in connection with the body.; They are many levels of twisted from other forms of humanity.; Korean people are in trouble if they don&#39;t evolve. I&#39;m half korean. They are so trapped in their minds they don&#39;t realize their physical and spiritual state can change.; I feel pity for Korean society 😔; This make me so sad for some reason :(; Thank you for your videos.; <b>No one is realizing this but Korea is such a messed up society. Over there you literally have a higher chance of getting a job if you look pretty. Even if you don&#39;t look pretty/handsome but have the skills you still have a low chance! 🙄Like why should you look pretty/handsome for the job, the skills matters it&#39;s not like you are getting paid just because you look pretty/handsome. Also koreans (not all) focus on their outer beauty too much they should instead focus on their inner beauty. They spend large amounts of money just to get these stupid cosmetic surgeries. They aren&#39;t appreciating their unique beauty and all Koreans would end up looking the same if they all do surgery. I feel so bad for those Koreans who feel embarrassed about their country. I&#39;m so grateful I was not born in that messed up country</b>; I wonder how they recognize each other <br>Like 6 bomb grp they all look same to me <br>After knowing that many korean undergo plastic surgery <br>I stopped watching kdramas even chinese Dramas <br>Because they made me feel uncomfortable about my looks <br>And even same things happen again and again <br><br> So started watching bollywood movies and (serial like tmkoc)<br>They represent many social problems, moral values,  comedy , dance , music <br>India is just awesome <br>I hope in my second life also <br>I want to be in india <br>I can recommend you many movies like 3 idiots,  dangal , 102 not out , secret superstar,  padman etc; According to korean beauty standards ( having small face,double eyelid,peal colour, Big eyes, st.eyebrow n St. nose and long legs) I know these features are attractive....but if everyone has the same body appearance then is this not a quiet disappointing🙄🙄🙄 imagine a mother has two baby girls and two baby boys having exact same facial features 😂😂😂🤞 ahh thnk god there&#39;s no STD for hairstyles too otherwise we&#39;ll get confused by hairstyles too 😂; Why you guys do plastic surgery..? Its a hereditary traits from your mom and dad... So you should preserve your natural beauty given by your mom and dad.... Its so difficult to distinguish kpop idols face.....like i get confused who is who.... See i can distinguish selena and ariana.... Buyt cannot distinguish kpop idol.. They look so similar... In my country everyone has got double eyelids... But wats the point of having it... You can see these colourful world even wid single eyelids... So please stop... You all look beautiful the way you are...; There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a plastic surgery, but its kinda sad to see how most of them felt pressured and felt the need to fit in the beauty standards.; Interestingly, everybody in this video interview already has a nice face.  Would have been interesting if an objectively homely* person had answered questions.<br>I realize that as an outsider I can&#39;t possibly know the beauty standard people are chasing when they go for plastic surgery in other countries.  Here in the US people are crazy about lip injections, Botox in the forehead, or my favorite, those veneers so white they&#39;re almost blue.  I see those same people in historical movies and it annoys me to no end.  Dude, in the Wild West,  nobody had shiny white teeth, let alone many teeth at all by adulthood.  I get a similar effect when I watch Korean dramas set before the advent of plastic surgery and people in historical costume and the nose bridge implant thing are in prominent roles.  I guess any cosmetic surgery makes suspension of disbelief that much more challenging.  :-o; A lot of Koreans “seem” to have plastic surgery, but it’s statistics. SO many foreigners come to Korea just to get plastic surgery. Mostly from China, Vietnam, Thai, et cetera. Just in year 2015, fifty-six thousand Chinese people came to Korea just to get plastic surgery. But because statistics only consider the “number” of surgeries conducted in Korea, people often get mistaken.<br><br>This video make it seem like half the Korean population get plastic surgery, but it’s similar to any other countries. It’s stereotypes. <br><br>Nonetheless, I do agree many Koreans feel insecure and care about their looks a lot. That’s why fashion, cosmetics, and skin care is a thing in Korea.; If you want to change something in your body or face, it is important not to change what is your good personality and your heart because I believe what is important is not physical appearance. CAUSE  IT IS VITAL NOT PHYSICAL.; But Korean Beauty is Fake. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>North Korea is a Natural Beauty of Korea. 🇰🇵; 한국 기준이 높은건 맞고 나도 문제가 있다고 생각하는데 무쌍인 눈과 노란 피부를 한국인의 특성이라고 생각하는게 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ; They sound like members of some cult; Korea is all about look even with its high development korea is kinda toxic; I personally don&#39;t like &#39;asian&#39; eyes, but that&#39;s just my opinion. It&#39;s so sad that even korean parents force their daughters to get surgery.; Get plastic surgery for yourself and not others. Simple; IDOLS ..KDRAMA ACTORS..MODELS this people live from their looks and talent ..but do I have to be pretty or good looking in order to get  the job that I want cuz everybody is highly educated in Korea? and been good looking is one of the requirements .?!!What kind of bullying is that? Remember that NO ONE CAN MAKE YOU INFERIOR WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT...; Beauty lies in one&#39;s vision not in the subject. Appreciating our own beauty is an art and respect our parents and God and most importantly to ourselves. Maintaing is good but totally changing it&#39;s just shows how foolish  you r for accepting others opinions rather that yourselves. <br>People wants to be modern but they don&#39;t have the courage to accept the truth and not judging each other! Do at all ur life, waste ur life judging each other rather than contributing to humanity.; I&#39;ve never find Korean attractive that&#39;s it..; <a

Only jawline and nose was talked about. I know  QOVES has covered other features in details in other videos, but they had to talk on many more this like role of eyes and how north perceives the southern part and how east is not far behind mainland etc. But anyways I did like the 1st half!; First your India map is wrong abd Tripura Nagaland,Assam,punjab are all parts of India please correct it; What crap you done with Indian map??? Kashmir,laddakh,Punjab and Noth East Part of India.I Hope you find right one next time before making the video.; I have seen many gorgeous dark-skinned (Fitzpatrick 5) Indian girls and women. It is unfortunate that we cannot discuss and instead overlook what makes them beautiful, almost as if they don&#39;t exist, in favour of Aryan ideals.; Aryan invasion theory is incorrect,  ancient Indians were the one who invaded the European region and spread their genes there , do some research; I like your content. Especially the fact that you take it from actual researches. <br>The only issue I have felt is that I find your voice a bit flat. Like there is no much intonations. <br>I find this as an issue when I watch multiple of your videos. <br>It feels ok for the first video especially because the content offsets there lack of intonations. But by the third video, it becomes a real issue for me. <br>May be it&#39;s just me. Have you got similar feedback?; sorry but kashmir is in india not in pakistan huh; Dark skin is NOT unattractive at all. It really depends on the face. One of the girl I had a crush on when I was in school was dark skinned but had a aesthetic body with a beautiful face. It is the mix of face, skin, color, hair and all other attributes which makes someone beautiful.; The map of the Indian subcontinent is so incorrect. A part of India is taken away???; Very badly researched video wrong map,aryan picnic theory and much more; Is it possible to talk about kerala in south india its different there. Also ashwarya rai is south indian; Going to report this video for showing ridiculously wrong map of India. Who the fuck gave you this? China or Pakistan?; I love my skin. It&#39;s dark and that&#39;s distinctive.; Where is Kashmir in India? Your map is wrong bro.; It&#39;s weird because I&#39;m pretty sure even white people don&#39;t care that much about skin tone, as far as I know; Wrong mapp!!; Indian Map is wrong. DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!!!; This is one of the worst videos on this channel. Indian or south Asian beauty standards are much more complex than the makers of the video put their effort in order to understand into. It just makes one extremely disappointed.; In ancient times Black skin was supposed to be a beauty standard in India but with time society accepts colonial beauty standards.; Interesting video, but I&#39;m disappointed the majority of the focus was on beauty standards for women. What has the South Asian beauty standard for males been, and what is it now? The male at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> is one of the most beautiful males I have ever seen - is he considered an ideal beauty?; my parents are both from punjab in india but i&#39;ve grown up in the uk, surrounded by mainly caucasian people. i don&#39;t know why, but i still had the desire to bleach my skin when i was ~8 years old. i wasn&#39;t really too exposed to south asian beauty standards, but i hated my skin colour (which is already a really light shade of brown).<br><br>it took me until only last year to appreciate my own skin colour, because i remember even just a couple of years ago during covid, i wanted to stay indoors as much as i could to keep my skin insanely light, especially because i saw a tiktok of someone else having done that.<br><br>also having friends who are the same skin tone as me helped me accept myself. but it&#39;s weird that although i&#39;ve hated my skin colour for as long as i could remember, my family and extended family really love my appearance.<br><br>i love hearing these beauty standards being addressed because i&#39;ve had this feeling that south asians barely have representation, or have barely had representation while i was growing up. thank you for making this video! c:; Aryan Invaders?? Are you fking kidding me. Go take a history lesson fool 😡😡😡. It&#39;s not Aryan invaders, it&#39;s greek invaders fool.; Stop singing &quot;Aryan Aryan&quot;, they&#39;re native to India and that region you fool.; I would suggest you don&#39;t use that distorted map of India. Also, be precise about Aryan and non-aryan thing. You&#39;re not correct there.; I&#39;m so happy Maldives is included we are often ignored lol; MotherPhucker Show the Correct map of India; Wrong map, wrong theories. Whats this? A propoganda piece?; Having dark / olive / tanned skin is what I would love to have :(; Indians have the best hair. Period.; the aryan theory imposed is just bogus.there were no aryan immigrants...we are native to this land...; Wrong indian map used; Indians welcome to Australia!; The MAP shown in the video is INCORRECT and the underlying issue has huge sentiments attached to it. The reach and the growth of this channel is promising and for that reason I think the correction must be made, making sure that misleading information doesn&#39;t spread.; Punjab is not country it is state bro .; I feel like you could have added the whole desirable Aryan features vs Dravidian features; Mughals were from central asia not middle east.; As a Pakistani with Turkic ancestry from Central Asia (those same guys you called &#39;Middle Eastern&#39;), I was disappointed when this just turned out to be North Indian vs South Indian. I can&#39;t blame you though; South Asia is extremely diverse. That being said, many of the modern beauty standards of India were of course similar to Eastern Pakistan (Punjab and Sindh) as the people are ethnically similar to North Indians. As Eastern Pakistanis dominated various areas such as politics, media, sports etc. their ideals became the ideals of the less represented West and North Pakistanis. So now you can find cake-faced brides all over Pakistan🤦‍♂. On the other hand, North and West Pakistanis are fairer so colourism does actually favor them. I think I myself conform to Western beauty standards more than &#39;South Asian beauty standards&#39;: I have high cheekbones (probably because of the Turkic ancestry) which are pretty prominent, hooded eyes and a good jaw. I&#39;m hoping to lose some weight to accentuate my good features.; Appreciate your video but  Please do use the appropriate geographical maps for your videos. The imaginary boundaries really hurt. If not sure then please pixelate the boundaries or show the subcontinent as a whole.; Panjab a state?💀; The map in this video 💀💀; Look at Malaylam industry, most actress and actors are Malayalis itself, in tamil Industry also they cast malayali actresses they perfectly represents average south indian women; Im white european, and I&#39;m SUPER into Indian girls, but I never agree with Indian beauty standards, to the point where it is even difficult for me to find attractive women in Indian media. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=371"">6:11</a> the assistant girl in the grey t-shirt is WAY hotter to me than the model she is helping in the photoshoot.; Wrong map of India; Wrong map of India; Punjab is part of india; I think North Indians / Pakistanis / afghans Persians /Tajiks basically the whole of northern south Asian and west Asian including Iran Iraq have very attractive people; RIP THE MAP OF INDIA..<br>Search &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; or &quot;Akhand Aryavarth&quot; for Reality Pilling, which is the continent that is refered to as the lost continent of Atlantis by the Greeks and Third Reichers..<br>Search for &quot;Dwarka&quot;, which is a sunken utopian city of Atlantis..; In South film&#39;s are are North Indian actress because of southern are little bit more darker than northern area. (Example agarwal, bhumika, charmee kaur, tammanna,) <br><br>And bollywood actress getting fair day by day 😂😂😂; Assam, Tripura ,Punjab and Nagaland are States of India only. They are not different countries <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=77"">1:17</a>.; Basically being white.; whos the girl at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=470"">7:50</a> ?; South Indian, half Dravidian half black (Ethiopian mom)  (skin tone- expresso back)  bullied all my school life till 10th. it stopped because i was 6&#39;1 pushing 85kg at that time now it is even better 6&#39;4 🙂; Be original is a real beauty 🍁☮️; Please cover Deepika Padukone!!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=444"">7:24</a> What accent is that lol?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=687"">11:27</a> I think Indian male beauty standards are not very different from the West; Actually, when you mentioned aquiline noses I wanted to ask if you could do a video on faces that are attractive with an aquiline or Roman noses, in both men and women. I’m so interested because I met a woman who had an aquiline nose and she was so gorgeous! Individually, her features were not attractive, but together they gave her an extreme attractiveness.; Here we go again whole comment section filled with cringy Indian bragging..; Is the face shape square cause I get made fun of for having a square face; Personally, I never understood the fixation with skin whitening. I do, rationally, understand how historically and sociopolitically light skin has been related with socio-economical wealth and higher social classes, largely due to colonialism. But, from an aesthetical  perspective, I&#39;ve always liked darker skin tones (from tan to super dark brown, although I personally prefer warmer rather than cold undertones). Even though I like dark skin, I also have never thought of light skin as ugly or unattractive either. I just don&#39;t understand how skin tone or height are considered &quot;intrinsically beautiful/undesirable&quot;. That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Even from an &quot;objective&quot; point of view, the beauty would be in the combination of traits, the harmony or the uniqueness... How can you say someone is pretty or ugly just because of their color, that&#39;s like saying only your race or ethnicity makes you ugly or beautiful, not your specific traits in combination. And despite logically understanding the consequences of colonialism, it still baffles me how deep rooted is colorism in places where the vast majority of the population aren&#39;t pale... Considering people tend to find familiar traits to them more attractive and unfamiliar traits more difficult to distinguish. It&#39;s just surreal, to imagine all these powerful people who own business and control the industry, perpetuating this narrative of how the way their own skin looks is unacceptable and inferior, pandering to the west, instead of empowering their own families and looks. Idk. It&#39;s just...; And You are showing the wrong map of India.; Indian supermodels have dark skin and. They prefer facial features to skin colour in the modeling industry while in movie industry fairer skin people are preferred. Totally different desirable beauty standards in modeling and movie industry.; No hate but why does everyone think it&#39;s indians when south asia is mentioned. I don&#39;t like it. Cause I&#39;m not indian.; Well I&#39;m blessed to have white skin. It&#39;s a major beauty standard here. Big eyes, thick long black hair is also very attractive here.; general public - men want tanned skin not fair to look masculine. But they like women to be white <br>women like clear skin not necessarily white just not dark. <br>movie women - just western beauty (white ); Lmao what a waste of time 😂; Aryan invasion or migration theory is fake. Please update for the future videos.; Hey, love your content  on aesthetics and beauty.<br> I just wanted to point out that Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, and other northeastern states are very much part of India. The northeast of India has different communities and tribes with Mongolian, Tibeto- Burmese, and Indo-Aryan,  features and appearance, which is very different from the Mainlanders. Northeast Indians are silenced from the mainland narrative and are often a target of racism. By using this map, you are further consolidating the exclusion of the northeastern.; The tweet at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=474"">7:54</a> is too politically charged for a video on Indian beauty standards. Better not to include it, or replace it with a neutral non political tweet on colourism.; Bruh this video was not comprehensive at all, just historic stuff lmao be more detailed and make another video, I know you&#39;re a brown guy too lmao; Ancient Indian woman beauty standard:<br>&quot;Shyama-padma palasha-akshi, Neela-Kunchita-murudhwaja&quot;<br>The above is a shloka from Mahabharata, in the praise of its heroine Draupadi, who is further written as the most beautiful woman to have born in India. <br>The verse translates to what she looks like: &quot;Dusky  (tan skinned), eyes like lotus petals, hairs dark and curly...&quot; <br>The overall figure of women was always preferred to be curvy. The women&#39;s statues have rigourous breasts and large buttocks, but with a thin waist. There could be a slight hint of belly fat but overall women had Kardashian bodies. <br><br>Modern Indian beauty standards are all about having fair yellow skin, being tall, having large eyes and long nose. With body, its more about zero figure. There is no emphasis on curves anymore.; Beauty standard should be taken and put directly in the trashcan and be replaced with HEALTH ! <br>All appearances, so less for health and happiness. <br>Sure it&#39;s good for businesses to always be after standards we can&#39;t reach without spending tonnes of money. <br>We should be preoccupied with health, not so much wit appearance.; Why did you seperated Jammu and punjab from India they are our part and in our control not even a single country in the world recognise Jammu a part of pakistan and punjab an indipendent state.; The only thing wrong with this video was the map you showed.; Probably have to remember that easy Indians look like far east Asians, northern Indians look white and even have light skin and hair, south Indians look black and have darker skins and curlier hair, and west Indians look like the common Indian image. So India doesn&#39;t have the &quot;everyone has a monolid so we want double eyelids&quot; or &quot;everyone has a high nose so we want a low nose&quot; or any other racially defined standard. It gets harder and harder because you have to be attractive not just to one race but every race out there since you grow up around all of them.; All the graphs and text is boring . More facial pictures; People are saying that in north Indian people do racism but I have so many friends who are black and they do not get offended even a bit even if me or someone other call them black that do not call to hurt them but in a fun way and I have a preety fair skin and I got called &quot;kalu&quot; which in haryana is very common slang for black person; south asians like deep black thick hair; Wtf was that map and division?","Exploring South Asian Beauty Standards | Beauty Culture Personalized step-by-step beauty advice: https://www.qoves.com/services/ Follow the brand across platforms for new content: ...

Like there is no much intonations. <br>I find this as an issue when I watch multiple of your videos. <br>It feels ok for the first video especially because the content offsets there lack of intonations. But by the third video, it becomes a real issue for me. <br>May be it&#39;s just me. Have you got similar feedback?; sorry but kashmir is in india not in pakistan huh; Dark skin is NOT unattractive at all. It really depends on the face. One of the girl I had a crush on when I was in school was dark skinned but had a aesthetic body with a beautiful face. It is the mix of face, skin, color, hair and all other attributes which makes someone beautiful.; The map of the Indian subcontinent is so incorrect. A part of India is taken away???; Very badly researched video wrong map,aryan picnic theory and much more; Is it possible to talk about kerala in south india its different there. Also ashwarya rai is south indian; Going to report this video for showing ridiculously wrong map of India. Who the fuck gave you this? China or Pakistan?; I love my skin. It&#39;s dark and that&#39;s distinctive.; Where is Kashmir in India? Your map is wrong bro.; It&#39;s weird because I&#39;m pretty sure even white people don&#39;t care that much about skin tone, as far as I know; Wrong mapp!!; Indian Map is wrong. DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!!!; This is one of the worst videos on this channel. Indian or south Asian beauty standards are much more complex than the makers of the video put their effort in order to understand into. It just makes one extremely disappointed.; In ancient times Black skin was supposed to be a beauty standard in India but with time society accepts colonial beauty standards.; Interesting video, but I&#39;m disappointed the majority of the focus was on beauty standards for women. What has the South Asian beauty standard for males been, and what is it now? The male at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> is one of the most beautiful males I have ever seen - is he considered an ideal beauty?; my parents are both from punjab in india but i&#39;ve grown up in the uk, surrounded by mainly caucasian people. i don&#39;t know why, but i still had the desire to bleach my skin when i was ~8 years old. i wasn&#39;t really too exposed to south asian beauty standards, but i hated my skin colour (which is already a really light shade of brown).<br><br>it took me until only last year to appreciate my own skin colour, because i remember even just a couple of years ago during covid, i wanted to stay indoors as much as i could to keep my skin insanely light, especially because i saw a tiktok of someone else having done that.<br><br>also having friends who are the same skin tone as me helped me accept myself. but it&#39;s weird that although i&#39;ve hated my skin colour for as long as i could remember, my family and extended family really love my appearance.<br><br>i love hearing these beauty standards being addressed because i&#39;ve had this feeling that south asians barely have representation, or have barely had representation while i was growing up. thank you for making this video! c:; Aryan Invaders?? Are you fking kidding me. Go take a history lesson fool 😡😡😡. It&#39;s not Aryan invaders, it&#39;s greek invaders fool.; Stop singing &quot;Aryan Aryan&quot;, they&#39;re native to India and that region you fool.; I would suggest you don&#39;t use that distorted map of India. Also, be precise about Aryan and non-aryan thing. You&#39;re not correct there.; I&#39;m so happy Maldives is included we are often ignored lol; MotherPhucker Show the Correct map of India; Wrong map, wrong theories. Whats this? A propoganda piece?; Having dark / olive / tanned skin is what I would love to have :(; Indians have the best hair. Period.; the aryan theory imposed is just bogus.there were no aryan immigrants...we are native to this land...; Wrong indian map used; Indians welcome to Australia!; The MAP shown in the video is INCORRECT and the underlying issue has huge sentiments attached to it. The reach and the growth of this channel is promising and for that reason I think the correction must be made, making sure that misleading information doesn&#39;t spread.; Punjab is not country it is state bro .; I feel like you could have added the whole desirable Aryan features vs Dravidian features; Mughals were from central asia not middle east.; As a Pakistani with Turkic ancestry from Central Asia (those same guys you called &#39;Middle Eastern&#39;), I was disappointed when this just turned out to be North Indian vs South Indian. I can&#39;t blame you though; South Asia is extremely diverse. That being said, many of the modern beauty standards of India were of course similar to Eastern Pakistan (Punjab and Sindh) as the people are ethnically similar to North Indians. As Eastern Pakistanis dominated various areas such as politics, media, sports etc. their ideals became the ideals of the less represented West and North Pakistanis. So now you can find cake-faced brides all over Pakistan🤦‍♂. On the other hand, North and West Pakistanis are fairer so colourism does actually favor them. I think I myself conform to Western beauty standards more than &#39;South Asian beauty standards&#39;: I have high cheekbones (probably because of the Turkic ancestry) which are pretty prominent, hooded eyes and a good jaw. I&#39;m hoping to lose some weight to accentuate my good features.; Appreciate your video but  Please do use the appropriate geographical maps for your videos. The imaginary boundaries really hurt. If not sure then please pixelate the boundaries or show the subcontinent as a whole.; Panjab a state?💀; The map in this video 💀💀; Look at Malaylam industry, most actress and actors are Malayalis itself, in tamil Industry also they cast malayali actresses they perfectly represents average south indian women; Im white european, and I&#39;m SUPER into Indian girls, but I never agree with Indian beauty standards, to the point where it is even difficult for me to find attractive women in Indian media. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=371"">6:11</a> the assistant girl in the grey t-shirt is WAY hotter to me than the model she is helping in the photoshoot.; Wrong map of India; Wrong map of India; Punjab is part of india; I think North Indians / Pakistanis / afghans Persians /Tajiks basically the whole of northern south Asian and west Asian including Iran Iraq have very attractive people; RIP THE MAP OF INDIA..<br>Search &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; or &quot;Akhand Aryavarth&quot; for Reality Pilling, which is the continent that is refered to as the lost continent of Atlantis by the Greeks and Third Reichers..<br>Search for &quot;Dwarka&quot;, which is a sunken utopian city of Atlantis..; In South film&#39;s are are North Indian actress because of southern are little bit more darker than northern area. (Example agarwal, bhumika, charmee kaur, tammanna,) <br><br>And bollywood actress getting fair day by day 😂😂😂; Assam, Tripura ,Punjab and Nagaland are States of India only. They are not different countries <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=77"">1:17</a>.; Basically being white.; whos the girl at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=470"">7:50</a> ?; South Indian, half Dravidian half black (Ethiopian mom)  (skin tone- expresso back)  bullied all my school life till 10th. it stopped because i was 6&#39;1 pushing 85kg at that time now it is even better 6&#39;4 🙂; Be original is a real beauty 🍁☮️; Please cover Deepika Padukone!!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=444"">7:24</a> What accent is that lol?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=687"">11:27</a> I think Indian male beauty standards are not very different from the West; Actually, when you mentioned aquiline noses I wanted to ask if you could do a video on faces that are attractive with an aquiline or Roman noses, in both men and women. I’m so interested because I met a woman who had an aquiline nose and she was so gorgeous! Individually, her features were not attractive, but together they gave her an extreme attractiveness.; Here we go again whole comment section filled with cringy Indian bragging..; Is the face shape square cause I get made fun of for having a square face; Personally, I never understood the fixation with skin whitening. I do, rationally, understand how historically and sociopolitically light skin has been related with socio-economical wealth and higher social classes, largely due to colonialism. But, from an aesthetical  perspective, I&#39;ve always liked darker skin tones (from tan to super dark brown, although I personally prefer warmer rather than cold undertones). Even though I like dark skin, I also have never thought of light skin as ugly or unattractive either. I just don&#39;t understand how skin tone or height are considered &quot;intrinsically beautiful/undesirable&quot;. That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Even from an &quot;objective&quot; point of view, the beauty would be in the combination of traits, the harmony or the uniqueness... How can you say someone is pretty or ugly just because of their color, that&#39;s like saying only your race or ethnicity makes you ugly or beautiful, not your specific traits in combination. And despite logically understanding the consequences of colonialism, it still baffles me how deep rooted is colorism in places where the vast majority of the population aren&#39;t pale... Considering people tend to find familiar traits to them more attractive and unfamiliar traits more difficult to distinguish. It&#39;s just surreal, to imagine all these powerful people who own business and control the industry, perpetuating this narrative of how the way their own skin looks is unacceptable and inferior, pandering to the west, instead of empowering their own families and looks. Idk. It&#39;s just...; And You are showing the wrong map of India.; Indian supermodels have dark skin and. They prefer facial features to skin colour in the modeling industry while in movie industry fairer skin people are preferred. Totally different desirable beauty standards in modeling and movie industry.; No hate but why does everyone think it&#39;s indians when south asia is mentioned. I don&#39;t like it. Cause I&#39;m not indian.; Well I&#39;m blessed to have white skin. It&#39;s a major beauty standard here. Big eyes, thick long black hair is also very attractive here.; general public - men want tanned skin not fair to look masculine. But they like women to be white <br>women like clear skin not necessarily white just not dark. <br>movie women - just western beauty (white ); Lmao what a waste of time 😂; Aryan invasion or migration theory is fake. Please update for the future videos.; Hey, love your content  on aesthetics and beauty.<br> I just wanted to point out that Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, and other northeastern states are very much part of India. The northeast of India has different communities and tribes with Mongolian, Tibeto- Burmese, and Indo-Aryan,  features and appearance, which is very different from the Mainlanders. Northeast Indians are silenced from the mainland narrative and are often a target of racism. By using this map, you are further consolidating the exclusion of the northeastern.; The tweet at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTVWw1F3R9E&amp;t=474"">7:54</a> is too politically charged for a video on Indian beauty standards. Better not to include it, or replace it with a neutral non political tweet on colourism.; Bruh this video was not comprehensive at all, just historic stuff lmao be more detailed and make another video, I know you&#39;re a brown guy too lmao; Ancient Indian woman beauty standard:<br>&quot;Shyama-padma palasha-akshi, Neela-Kunchita-murudhwaja&quot;<br>The above is a shloka from Mahabharata, in the praise of its heroine Draupadi, who is further written as the most beautiful woman to have born in India. <br>The verse translates to what she looks like: &quot;Dusky  (tan skinned), eyes like lotus petals, hairs dark and curly...&quot; <br>The overall figure of women was always preferred to be curvy. The women&#39;s statues have rigourous breasts and large buttocks, but with a thin waist. There could be a slight hint of belly fat but overall women had Kardashian bodies. <br><br>Modern Indian beauty standards are all about having fair yellow skin, being tall, having large eyes and long nose. With body, its more about zero figure. There is no emphasis on curves anymore.; Beauty standard should be taken and put directly in the trashcan and be replaced with HEALTH ! <br>All appearances, so less for health and happiness. <br>Sure it&#39;s good for businesses to always be after standards we can&#39;t reach without spending tonnes of money. <br>We should be preoccupied with health, not so much wit appearance.; Why did you seperated Jammu and punjab from India they are our part and in our control not even a single country in the world recognise Jammu a part of pakistan and punjab an indipendent state.; The only thing wrong with this video was the map you showed.; Probably have to remember that easy Indians look like far east Asians, northern Indians look white and even have light skin and hair, south Indians look black and have darker skins and curlier hair, and west Indians look like the common Indian image. So India doesn&#39;t have the &quot;everyone has a monolid so we want double eyelids&quot; or &quot;everyone has a high nose so we want a low nose&quot; or any other racially defined standard. It gets harder and harder because you have to be attractive not just to one race but every race out there since you grow up around all of them.; All the graphs and text is boring . More facial pictures; People are saying that in north Indian people do racism but I have so many friends who are black and they do not get offended even a bit even if me or someone other call them

Asian American Women Share Struggles With Beauty Standards,As/Is,2019-05-29T18:00:11Z,"For most women, the pressure to be ""beautiful"" is difficult, but Asian American women face a unique challenge. Subscribe to As/Is: ...",oEeGLzGgRm4,"WHAT EVER... Esp after 30,  Asian women smoke most western women, Esp the body......; Never been to west but isn’t tan skin considered desirable and pale skin peeps are seen as losers? Or not cool?; I am a man asian and crying. God am I a wimp?; What a crock of $hit!; I&#39;m Japanese and I have slanted eyes, flat face and small chest and flat butt, I look stereotypical Asian. The problem with Asian people is that when others in Asia don&#39;t look stereotypically Asian, we get jealous of that ethnicity and we slander them and deflect what we look like and what we are or do onto others we can&#39;t compete with. As Asians we know we can&#39;t complete with other ethnicities and slander others in Asia who look better than us or who have diverse features that dont look like stereotypical Asian. That says alot. We think our Asian features are unattractive, because Asians will be racists to each other for looking Asian and be jealous of those who look distinctly different or have various features than the rest of us I&#39;m Asia. Asians do it all the time. So, why act sad when we feel low for being Asian when we slander others?; Be glad you&#39;re not in your ancestral country.  You will conform or be a total outcast over there.  You have it so good in America the fact you can make this video.  You don;t understand how well you have it.  Yes your family/people may frown upon your american tendencies but they may not ostracize you completely in USA.  even if they do, you can still do what you want and thrive in the USA.  In the USA you have the right to be as fat and sloppy as you want.  nobody cares.  but dont ever try to demand society sees your sloppiness as beautiful.  it will never happen.; I haven’t had the desire to travel to Taiwan and Asia because of the comments too. I don’t understand why its appropriate to comment about anyone’s weight. Let alone a child’s!; Omg the nose pinching and obsession with white skin I can totally relate to! 😫 Asian family members expect you to be like 80-100 pounds too. When I gained weight to be like 130-140&#39;s people were so mean just like that lady who told an eight year old that! 🤬 People pointed out everything in me that also killed my self-esteem. I stopped going to places with judgmental people. From back handed compliments to fat jokes. &quot;You look so funny with a fat face with loud laughter&quot; and &quot;Your boyfriend looks so much better than you, but you&#39;re such a wonderful human being.&quot;  I already accepted that some people in this world are just superficial and attraction is attraction. People just like what they like, but ugh it&#39;s sooo annoying when people point things out in a rude manner! Can&#39;t people connect at a soul level?; Dude imagine being us Asian men, the struggle out here; I wonder what are the standards of American women in dating?<br><br>I think their minimum standards are assholes!!!! 😂😂😂; All you Asian females are brainwashed, hogwashed, white washed, whatever you call it. You Asian females are still trash by the end of the broadcast. Trash.; Maybe stop trying to be white and just accept that you&#39;re asian and theres nothing wrong with it. I dated a girl like this once and it was a nightmare. She put whiteness on such a crazy pedestal it was insane.; I often hear things like this but its almost ALWAYS  a woman who is criticizing another woman not a man. <br>I am English by race and culture, I live in China and my wife is Chinese. <br>I adore every type of Asian woman, every face, every body, every personality. <br>Asian women are the most incredible on earth. <br>I have a group of friends and colleagues here who are all european and they all agree on this point, even the ones who are married to europeans lol. <br>The first lady shown in this video is gorgeous. &#39;The Asian nose&#39; is different to european noses but so what? Asian eyes are more attractive than european eyes and Asian hair is better, asian skin is smoother, asian voices are more pleasing, Asian bodies are usually fitter and more impressive, Asian personalities are more appealing. Even an angry Asian woman is more loveable than an angry european woman in my opinion. <br>I cannot imagine anyone looking down on Asian features except perhaps Americans (!). In my experience Americans (both black and white) are a very strange group of people who just look down on everyone who isnt American. I am generalising ofcourse but there is truth to this. <br>Anyway, I love you Asian girls and so do millions/billions of men so please dont listen to your mean grandmothers and jealous doctors or neighbours because they dont know anything. <br><br>Please leave your noses, skin colour and eyes alone. I truly believe that in 10 or 20 years Asian facial features will be the standard of beauty anyway.; SELF HATE PREVAILS.....; Does shaping the nose thing even Africans do that and African-Americans used to do that back in the day to make it look like they had more Eurocentric features; Hey beautiful asian ladies I just want to say I love you girls because I am William ball I gotta respect for asian american girls and kindness i always a nice guy and friendly I be your guy friend ❤; ONE OTHER THING I HAVE TO MENTION-<br>SO THE OTHER PROBLEM- STRUCTURAL PROBLEM- WAS SG EFFICIENCY WAS F- (IM TALKING THEIR backoff WHICH I MIGHT AS WELL SAY &#39;A COMPANY&#39;S CALL CENTER IN A LOW IQ COUNTRY LIKE filipines or korea&#39;) LET ME EXPLAIN-<br>YOU HAD AT LEAST 1 PERSON WHO WOULD COME IN AT 11AM (!!!!!!!!!)

But these women, they&#39;re gorgeous. 💗; The Indian girl talking about skinny-shaming has just voiced my opinions. Yes, in India skinny women are not considered to be women at all. People would automatically assume you don&#39;t get enough food to eat.; I&#39;m a chinese indonesian. I don&#39;t know the persentages of my chinese blood but i know its atleast 3/4 of my blood. But i live in a tiny city with few people in a far away island from big polluted and populated cities, i get glorified here as being a chinese and essentially having a lighter skin tone then the locals(90% population) especially its hotter here in my province. But when i went to jakarta and any other big polluted air cities(obviously the sun is blocked) and with a wider population of chinese people i got so shamed. My family who lives there and always has always points out how dark i am and sometimes even ask if i&#39;m really chinese, jokingly, but still it hurt. Ever since the first visit to jakarta and my family. My beauty standards changed completely. I used to love my semi tan skin, wavy-ish/floofy hair, wide eyes, but now all i can see in myself is how disgusting i am. I look homeless. By the beauty standards, i see kids there my age effortlessly being exactly like my beauty standard, their skin paleness can blind you, their hair flows in the wind in a straight line, but also at my home city. Im also differenciate it. They glorify me so much that they treat me as something higher, like a &quot;queen&quot; and not as a mutual friend. Even tho they are exactly like me, even my classmates. But just a different race. So now im stuck. I feel like i dont belong anywhere in life; growing up as a middle eastern girl, my grandparent would always make fun of my nose because it was “ too big”. I remember being humiliated for being tanned and hairy too. It’s disgusting how they claim to “ love us” yet they’re the ones bringing us down.; Well ,for me they all look just perfect.<br>I actually ,like the fact they are perfectly bilingual.; Asian women as a collective love to complain about unfair beauty standards but also love to put white men on a pedestal.

Greeks from Malta, as well as Italians from Sardinia, arrived with them; then French from Gibraltar and Camargue migrated to the Philippines too and the Portuguese settled in many provinces too. These people started to call themselves “FILIPINOS.” They wanted to break away from the power of the KING OF SPAIN. Only those “Castilians, Argentinians and Mexicans are loyal to the king during that time.” They studied and learned all the native dialects in the country; they mixed the Spanish creoles “Ermiteño and Basque Caviteño” with the local dialects and created the “TAGALA” known as TAGALOG. The Native locals of the country were called “ INDIOS.” They thought they were similar with the Incans, Aztecs, and Pacific Islanders.” Governor Narciso Claveria not only imposed the Spanish Names but FORCE ALL OF THESE EUROPEANS TO INTERMMARY WITH THE LOCALS.

In Asian culture, it’s about being like everyone else. I also feel like my mom had major self esteem issues and my mom can’t believe that her daughter has such dark skin. She even called me the “help” and her friends called me the “N” word; “why go to graduate school? You will never get in.  Why don’t you find a husband and get married? After graduating from graduate school and moving out to another state, I felt I had a lot of freedom. I have learned not to listen to her and have embraced my outer/inner beauty. I am in my 40’s with an awesome husband, my own kids and a great career bc I went to graduate school. My mom still says stupid things like your butt is getting bigger; why do people say you’re pretty, I just don’t see it! I love my mom but She will never change, but I have.  My husband will just whisper to me and say remember never listen to your mom. You’re beautiful in my eyes! Find people who think you are beautiful inside and out. Don’t keep up with everyone else bc it’s exhausting mentally. When you have to deal with people like your family, those people hate that their words cannot bring your confidence/self esteem down.  They have issues and they have to learn to live with it for the rest of their lives. At the end, I have also learned to lift my mom’s self esteem over the years and show her how to be more confident in herself! Mother and daughter can learn from each other! Wow - how the tables have turned!; The parents have no concept of boundaries, personal space, or self esteem. They can never learn to keep their hands and their nasty opinions to themselves.; My mom told me she would pinch my nose (more like push the bridge together and upwards) so that I could have a sharp nose.<br><br>My dad already had a sharp/high nose, while my mom&#39;s nose was small and straight. I thought her nose shape was  beautiful, but apparently in our community the sharp nose look was considered more attractive. My mom didn&#39;t want me to end up with her nose type because she was bullied for it being too flat her whole life 😞; asian girls are hot just the way they are. i like them in all colors and size; I really dont understand why the women of the east and elsewere try to get whiter skin when there are so many men that like your nicely colored skin.<br>So weird!; i&#39;m asian woman and yes I got that too &quot; your nose is too flat&quot; ..

They seem so strong in a way I can never achieve. My self esteem issues slowly transformed into my current decade old addiction issues.

Love the skin you are in; If I were of an ethnicity which has a distinct country and geographic location, I would want to reconnect with my people and my culture. I would never want to adhere to American Beauty standards. The reality is that these girls are most likely attracted to white guys or believe that by dating a white guy, they will be well off and as such feel compelled to compete with white girls for white men. For this reason, not fitting the American Beauty standard harms them to a certain degree.; So I&#39;m southeast asian. I was born really chubby, like it&#39;s the body type I have. I have a weird shaped head, a flat nose, not too round eyes, small lips, chin too pushed forward...and then there&#39;s my body, flat where it&#39;s not supposed to be flat, thighs to much fat, arms too flabby. Losing a lot of weight made me put in amounts of effort that I never did for anything else, but I end up picking out more stuff that&#39;s wrong with me and my body and continue to feel ashamed of them.<br><br><br>You never really see your true beauty until you learn to accept yourself. I don&#39;t know how either but that&#39;s really the only way.; I&#39;m white Canadian and my wife and step kids are filipino and I noticed that all the movie stars in the Philippines look like they have nose jobs, are so white etc.  My wife is terrified of the sun, they use whitening products.  I tell them its ok you are allowed to be dark in Canada.  The Korean movies they look white as a ghost.; As a Chinese raised in Hong Kong I wouldn’t even bat an eye when my relatives gifted me skincare and lifting products.

Or not cool?; I am a man asian and crying. God am I a wimp?; What a crock of $hit!; I&#39;m Japanese and I have slanted eyes, flat face and small chest and flat butt, I look stereotypical Asian. The problem with Asian people is that when others in Asia don&#39;t look stereotypically Asian, we get jealous of that ethnicity and we slander them and deflect what we look like and what we are or do onto others we can&#39;t compete with. As Asians we know we can&#39;t complete with other ethnicities and slander others in Asia who look better than us or who have diverse features that dont look like stereotypical Asian. That says alot. We think our Asian features are unattractive, because Asians will be racists to each other for looking Asian and be jealous of those who look distinctly different or have various features than the rest of us I&#39;m Asia. Asians do it all the time. So, why act sad when we feel low for being Asian when we slander others?; Be glad you&#39;re not in your ancestral country.  You will conform or be a total outcast over there.  You have it so good in America the fact you can make this video.  You don;t understand how well you have it.  Yes your family/people may frown upon your american tendencies but they may not ostracize you completely in USA.  even if they do, you can still do what you want and thrive in the USA.  In the USA you have the right to be as fat and sloppy as you want.  nobody cares.  but dont ever try to demand society sees your sloppiness as beautiful.  it will never happen.; I haven’t had the desire to travel to Taiwan and Asia because of the comments too. I don’t understand why its appropriate to comment about anyone’s weight.

When I gained weight to be like 130-140&#39;s people were so mean just like that lady who told an eight year old that! 🤬 People pointed out everything in me that also killed my self-esteem. I stopped going to places with judgmental people. From back handed compliments to fat jokes. &quot;You look so funny with a fat face with loud laughter&quot; and &quot;Your boyfriend looks so much better than you, but you&#39;re such a wonderful human being.&quot;  I already accepted that some people in this world are just superficial and attraction is attraction.

Can&#39;t people connect at a soul level?; Dude imagine being us Asian men, the struggle out here; I wonder what are the standards of American women in dating?<br><br>I think their minimum standards are assholes!!!! 😂😂😂; All you Asian females are brainwashed, hogwashed, white washed, whatever you call it. You Asian females are still trash by the end of the broadcast. Trash.; Maybe stop trying to be white and just accept that you&#39;re asian and theres nothing wrong with it. I dated a girl like this once and it was a nightmare. She put whiteness on such a crazy pedestal it was insane.; I often hear things like this but its almost ALWAYS  a woman who is criticizing another woman not a man. <br>I am English by race and culture, I live in China and my wife is Chinese. <br>I adore every type of Asian woman, every face, every body, every personality. <br>Asian women are the most incredible on earth. <br>I have a group of friends and colleagues here who are all european and they all agree on this point, even the ones who are married to europeans lol. <br>The first lady shown in this video is gorgeous. &#39;The Asian nose&#39; is different to european noses but so what? Asian eyes are more attractive than european eyes and Asian hair is better, asian skin is smoother, asian voices are more pleasing, Asian bodies are usually fitter and more impressive, Asian personalities are more appealing. Even an angry Asian woman is more loveable than an angry european woman in my opinion. <br>I cannot imagine anyone looking down on Asian features except perhaps Americans (!). In my experience Americans (both black and white) are a very strange group of people who just look down on everyone who isnt American. I am generalising ofcourse but there is truth to this. <br>Anyway, I love you Asian girls and so do millions/billions of men so please dont listen to your mean grandmothers and jealous doctors or neighbours because they dont know anything. <br><br>Please leave your noses, skin colour and eyes alone.

But i live in a tiny city with few people in a far away island from big polluted and populated cities, i get glorified here as being a chinese and essentially having a lighter skin tone then the locals(90% population) especially its hotter here in my province. But when i went to jakarta and any other big polluted air cities(obviously the sun is blocked) and with a wider population of chinese people i got so shamed. My family who lives there and always has always points out how dark i am and sometimes even ask if i&#39;m really chinese, jokingly, but still it hurt. Ever since the first visit to jakarta and my family. My beauty standards changed completely. I used to love my semi tan skin, wavy-ish/floofy hair, wide eyes, but now all i can see in myself is how disgusting i am. I look homeless. By the beauty standards, i see kids there my age effortlessly being exactly like my beauty standard, their skin paleness can blind you, their hair flows in the wind in a straight line, but also at my home city. Im also differenciate it. They glorify me so much that they treat me as something higher, like a &quot;queen&quot; and not as a mutual friend. Even tho they are exactly like me, even my classmates. But just a different race. So now im stuck. I feel like i dont belong anywhere in life; growing up as a middle eastern girl, my grandparent would always make fun of my nose because it was “ too big”.

I&#39;ve always been short, I&#39;m a mid size girl with large eyes and natural double eyelids. Some older women always went out of their way to let it be known I&#39;m not liked. I felt so little of myself for years but now I just don&#39;t care. People want my eyes and I&#39;m actually cute dang it! 😆 I can never be a tall skinny porcelain actress but I&#39;m a California tanned shorty who is not short of love. Lol. We need to start telling all girls they are beautiful. I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a girl and was like she is so hideous. Lol.

The standard of beauty is within your own race. To me the standard of beauty is an Asian woman.; It&#39;s so not fair. I mean you can&#39;t expect Fuji apple tree to grow Washington apples.

This really affected my self worth throughout my whole life; Beauty created by God in different forms and shape and its creation of by the Sl Mighty . The Korean celebrities fake their beauties by plastic surgery and they  keep on killing themselves even they are rich or beautiful . Being fake beautiful using plastic surgery  they feel fake internally and externally and everytime looking at them they have to accept  their beauty are fake  only plastic .

Most are  beautiful inside and out.; Meanwhile weger genocide in China😐; All these women are beautiful I dont see the problem 💪💞👍; Asians can be the most critical people on this planet,especially your family.  In Asian culture, it’s about being like everyone else. I also feel like my mom had major self esteem issues and my mom can’t believe that her daughter has such dark skin. She even called me the “help” and her friends called me the “N” word; “why go to graduate school? You will never get in.  Why don’t you find a husband and get married? After graduating from graduate school and moving out to another state, I felt I had a lot of freedom. I have learned not to listen to her and have embraced my outer/inner beauty. I am in my 40’s with an awesome husband, my own kids and a great career bc I went to graduate school. My mom still says stupid things like your butt is getting bigger; why do people say you’re pretty, I just don’t see it! I love my mom but She will never change, but I have.  My husband will just whisper to me and say remember never listen to your mom. You’re beautiful in my eyes! Find people who think you are beautiful inside and out. Don’t keep up with everyone else bc it’s exhausting mentally. When you have to deal with people like your family, those people hate that their words cannot bring your confidence/self esteem down.  They have issues and they have to learn to live with it for the rest of their lives. At the end, I have also learned to lift my mom’s self esteem over the years and show her how to be more confident in herself! Mother and daughter can learn from each other! Wow - how the tables have turned!; The parents have no concept of boundaries, personal space, or self esteem. They can never learn to keep their hands and their nasty opinions to themselves.; My mom told me she would pinch my nose (more like push the bridge together and upwards) so that I could have a sharp nose.<br><br>My dad already had a sharp/high nose, while my mom&#39;s nose was small and straight. I thought her nose shape was  beautiful, but apparently in our community the sharp nose look was considered more attractive. My mom didn&#39;t want me to end up with her nose type because she was bullied for it being too flat her whole life 😞; asian girls are hot just the way they are. i like them in all colors and size; I really dont understand why the women of the east and elsewere try to get whiter skin when there are so many men that like your nicely colored skin.<br>So weird!; i&#39;m asian woman and yes I got that too &quot; your nose is too flat&quot; .. I just laugh.. haha!; Confucius once said that &quot;Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it&quot; and he was absolutely correct. I don&#39;t see it in East Asian girls. Sorry. 🤭; I love every Asian; Is it just me or I look really beautiful in dark lighting and I turn on the lights more i look uglier lol; I&#39;m full asian and I dont want to look western I love my tan skin and being slim straight  natural hair and cat eyes men ask me out all the time  so dont care; As a half Vietnamese half Native American twenty something, I find it really hard to identify with any of these ladies. They seem so strong in a way I can never achieve. My self esteem issues slowly transformed into my current decade old addiction issues. I wish I could’ve gotten over hating myself before it got this bad. Oh well. I’m cheering from the side lines for these ladies.; But..... They&#39;re all pretty....; Youre asian who gives a damn; Asian Women&#39;s Complaints:  &quot;Men of all backgrounds find me attractive and I beat all white, black, hispanic women in the dating game.&quot;; Asian girls are Beautiful to I wouldn&#39;t mind dating one 😍😍😍; This is madness . Love the skin you are in; If I were of an ethnicity which has a distinct country and geographic location, I would want to reconnect with my people and my culture. I would never want to adhere to American Beauty standards. The reality is that these girls are most likely attracted to white guys or believe that by dating a white guy, they will be well off and as such feel compelled to compete with white girls for white men. For this reason, not fitting the American Beauty standard harms them to a certain degree.; So I&#39;m southeast asian. I was born really chubby, like it&#39;s the body type I have. I have a weird shaped head, a flat nose, not too round eyes, small lips, chin too pushed forward...and then there&#39;s my body, flat where it&#39;s not supposed to be flat, thighs to much fat, arms too flabby. Losing a lot of weight made me put in amounts of effort that I never did for anything else, but I end up picking out more stuff that&#39;s wrong with me and my body and continue to feel ashamed of them.<br><br><br>You never really see your true beauty until you learn to accept yourself. I don&#39;t know how either but that&#39;s really the only way.; I&#39;m white Canadian and my wife and step kids are filipino and I noticed that all the movie stars in the Philippines look like they have nose jobs, are so white etc.  My wife is terrified of the sun, they use whitening products.  I tell them its ok you are allowed to be dark in Canada.  The Korean movies they look white as a ghost.; As a Chinese raised in Hong Kong I wouldn’t even bat an eye when my relatives gifted me skincare and lifting products. So many girls request these as a gift; All of you women are beautiful!😊; “I only date 5’4 girls, small nose, Natrual blush, Perfect, BLaH, Plays piano, blonde,cute, and blah blah <b>*Goes on for hours*</b>; IM NOT TRYING TO BE FUNNY RIGHT NOW?

He runs an average of 15 miles every day and goes to the gym to work his upper body doing things like handstand pushups. And yet, he looks nothing like the chiseled men you see on social media. He has plenty of fat to support his muscles and you can&#39;t see his abs at all. Having all of your muscles exposed like bodybuilders is just a sign of starvation imo. It&#39;s ridiculous that this is seen as the peak male body.; Wait a second is that bit of music in the beginning from Splatoon (1) lobby&#39;s in between match waiting page...?; Im Hindu American and I always liked men from India who are Hindus.  I love Hinduism and Indian culture and I love going to Hindu temple.  I wanted to meet a man from India who love Hinduism, Indian culture and going to Hindu temple.<br>I didnt care if he was short or tall, fair or dark skinned, average weight, thin or even overweight.<br>But I was too shy and it never happened.; sexual selection means you want to fuck the people you find attractive <br><br>aocial media bombards you with options and leaves you feeling eternally aware of shortcomings in any potential partner you meet<br><br>our brains cant handle that much information, a local community is already enough <br><br>delete social media, become yourself. <br><br>you might be a bit more isolated, but those who respect your decision and those who enter your life afterwards are more likely to be valuable that whoever you attract with your photoshopped abs and projected supreme ideal personality<br><br>quality &gt; quantity; We also have to add on that the way movie stars represent getting fit is way outside the norm.<br>They often have poor trainers, no idea themselves what they are doing and extreme goals they have to archive in a short time. Most of them have to take Peds to meet them at all. <br>This is not representative if you take your time and are smart and consistent.<br>You can make incredible improvements in the span of a year.<br>It takes consistency and knowledge but nothing extreme; Well ahead of the curve; Does Efron think that there&#39;s only carbs in bread and pasta? Oh dear.; i know bollywood is stupid but i hope they can give me that cream i love it; Amazing how many men have developed an ED but the media doesn&#39;t show it as often as women suffering from the same disease...; Decent video, but I got a proble with a bit ... most men see shredded action figures and fictional built men and bodybuilders and feel inspired. They&#39;re not like women who will parade about body positivity and &#39;unrealistic&#39; standards.<br><br>It&#39;s fiction, men know some of it is unachievable, but they still strive to achieve that physique. These physiques, will looking unrealistic, take insane amounts of sacrifice and discipline. These actors and models simply do not want to put time into it outside of their roles, and that&#39;s why they regress. I use the male beauty standards as a guide to what I want, and I&#39;m currently on track to my dream physique, fully clean, no roids.<br><br>It takes time, effort, sacrifice and discipline to achieve it, but saying it&#39;s bogus is honestly retarded.; Revelation 12:17<br><br>17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.; ⛔  Natural muscular body is Vigintillion time better than some shitty Obesity, Diabetes patient, couch potato pathetic weak humans. 🚫<br><br>🔸Yes, say no to anabolic steroid.<br><br>🔸But if you can achieve good healthy natural aesthetic physique with proper workout, nutrition and rest.<br><br>🔸Then it will be millions time, not even vigintillion times better than some average American shitty couch potatoes obesity patient who eats unhealthy pizza, burger, soft drinks all day long sitting on sofa watching sitcoms TV serials, netflix.<br><br>🔸To stay healthy and fit we need to stay motivated to work hard, to maintain healthy discipline lifestyle.  <br><br>🔸 That&#39;s why we need to have an ideal perfect image in our brain. <br><br>🔸That doesn&#39;t always means you have to achieve exactly similar ideal result. Use it just to get motivated.<br><br>🔸Let&#39;s say a physics student could hang some pictures of some great scientist like Newton, Einstein, Galileo on his study room wall to get motivated in his physics study. It doesn&#39;t always mean he must have to be a great scientist too.<br><br>🔸Similarly we need to have a clear understanding on how a theoretically perfect ideal body should look like [Ideal System] So we could stay motivated, disciplined and well planned to achieve practically possible fit, healthy aesthetic physique. [Real System]<br><br>🔸From our high school science text book, we all know the difference between theoretically &quot;Ideal System&quot; and practically &quot;Real System. In the real world we could never achieve an Ideal System but we could use an Ideal model to improve ourselves as possible.<br><br>📛 Natural muscular body is Vigintillion time better than some shitty Obesity, Diabetes, couch potato patients. 🚫<br><br>❌ So please to don&#39;t mislead people not to be healthy and fit.<br><br>✅ Stay strong, Stay healthy. 💪<br>⛔ Don&#39;t be a pathetic weak human being. 👎; Im going to be honest. Most dudes need to get in way better shape and should be muscular. To get Biebers level is doable for anybody.  Biebers body is the lowest god damn level you should ever aim for. The real problem is most people just arent willing to do what it takes.  They think its unrealistic to do that much to get a body image they want. The dude with no shirt on doesnt suffer from body dysmorphia because if he did he wouldnt be doing an interview without his shirt on like that.  I think we hold people to too low of standard now in everything. If you cant make a 100k a year and cant be at least beiber level or excel at something than you gotta blame yourself. Its healthy to be critical and take on problems. Its unhealthy to accept a low standard for yourself.; Funny how mens &quot;health&quot; tend to put body builders in their frontpage. But they abuse the shit out of peds; There&#39;s a massive other cause behind this that no one wants to admit which is that multiple studies have shown that women find like 80-90% of men unattractive. Nothing motivates men more than women, if men feel like they have to use steroids and starve themselves to look good enough for a partner, they&#39;ll do it.; Thank you. Great video.; Why some people think that if a man wears something &quot;feminine&quot; it means they&#39;re gay??? Gay men can be &quot;masculine&quot; and still be gay as well straight men can be &quot;feminine&quot; and still be straight, how someone dress or act or look like it&#39;s not because of their sexuality! When will people understand that?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> my idea of a handsome attractive ideal man is very hairy, a little chunky, and soft featured, so... very much subjective and beauty standards don&#39;t mean shit because some people are gonna think you&#39;re ugly and some people are gonna think you&#39;re very attractive; the truth is most men will never be a girls erotic dream<br>so dont beat yourselves up dudes<br>it just wasnt meant to be<br>go j3rk off and wait til this shitshow called life ends; Meanwhile in reality young women are all over Benedict Cumberbach, Dylan O&#39;Brien and Tom Holland.; An average healthy long lasting body as shown during the 1960&#39;s phase is what people should maintain as far as i feel. Being too fat is unhealthy being too much unnaturally big and muscular is also as unhealthy as being fat as it is taxing to the mental health as well as to the body, But its ok if you are some trainer some where and that is all you do all day.; Thank you so much💐🙏; &quot;Extreme diet&quot; they&#39;re eating disorders. Makes me really sad that men are never spoken about regarding these issues. :(; Great video; And people think WOMEN get objectified. Men get it way worse and NO ONE talks about it; Your voice tone and body language are painful to watch it&#39;s too gay; One of the most shocking, those chests of actors, models etc are the result of PEDs and a breast reduction surgery.; It’s the fact that things 100 years ago were deemed attractive and now are deemed unattractive that makes the whole beauty thing completely fabricated and terrible to base your life around. Your mental and physical health should be your priority and with women it’s just a matter of bettering yourself to engage in a healthy relationship after that the standards are completely meaningless.; One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that no one ever talks about stuff like this from a skinny guys perpesctive its always from the perspective of being chubby <br>Its so damaging hearing all these people telling you that being skinny or chubby makes you less of a man and getting jacked is the only way to get the girl and the life you want. I think this leads young guys to start taking performance enhancing drugs which will ultimately killl them its terrible i cant believe its turned to this; yeah no one really ever talks about how male beauty standards effect men. everyone is always one about how they effect women and &quot;especially teenage girls&quot; when they browse instagram, completely ignoring men and boys in the equation who are definitely no less effected by it.<br>an example of this erasure from top of my head is this post I saw in pinterest not too long ago. wall has 2 entrances, one is just a large square hole for men and perfect babrie cutout for women.<br>but with all the body positive talk going on and how &quot;its not a movement for men!!&quot; it feels more like its the square hole for women and perfect arnold cutout for men.; a woman really don&#39;t need extreme face pack like bolywood heroes and it&#39;s also show woman as not independent we don&#39;t need your over facepack major body with fair skin man; The ridiculous &quot;men&quot; haircuts are truly a shitty sight to behold. They look stupid. The way we associated long hair with women is the reason we now have binary people who think if they are a woman and wear short hair, they can become men. These simpleminded stupid ideas should not be given any energy.; I do not wanna look like that. Like those bearded weird creatures. And because i reject that i have a lot of success with women. Sure, i am very tall, that helps. But the truth is that i have found my OWN look, and i tell you that this male selfimproovement movement is pure masturbation. And the result looks ridiculous. I dont wanna look like a castrated ox, like these weird bodybuilders. Blech; Whay BS. If you are not committed, then don&#39;t do it nor expect others to change for you. Humanbeings are attracted to these traits due to them.being...attractive. To expext anything else is asinine and goes against our biological development.; Video starts @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=79"">1:19</a>; So bassidallt thay want you to be fair tall fit and exhubit no emotions and stuff; As a gay man, the ideal of the chiselled, muscular body is something that causes distress and dysmorphia, but its still something I want for myself.; Thank you.; so white people want to be blacker and black people want to be whiter? haha; Eliud Kipchoge doesn&#39;t look like those buff dudes with six packs. He won Olympic gold<br>Having bug muscles isn&#39;t everything, sometimes it&#39;s even hindrance; ok pajeet; Women here saying &quot;oh no, poor men. Beauty standards are bad&quot; and bs like that will happily tell an average man to sod off because he&#39;s not tall/lean/muscular enough.; The rock is not handsome. He has an egg head and looks like a dinosaur. And looks dumb when he does that stupid eye thing thinking it makes him look good; I think it is actually crazy that some people desire a bright skin tone. My skin is so fucking bright that i get a sunburn within 15 Minutes if i leave the house without sun screen. I wish my skin was a bit darker 😂; Ciao Matteo, mi piace che sei stato schietto e diretto sulle tue considerazioni. Ho sentito sia Blackpepper sia Moon dust e niente… mi si è aperto un mondo! Grazie!!; It&#39;s funny how westerners think of India as a spiritual and tolerant place with a relatively benign dominant religion, whereas in reality they are just as racist, misogynistic and homophobic as you would expect from a poor nation.; I have an eating disorder. It&#39;s has nothing to do with body image, picking up women, or any of that nonsense. <br>I&#39;m simply too lazy to eat 🤷🏽‍♂️; Looking like those celebrities is unrealistic but you also need to look your best your body can make as well.; I am 20 yo man and I weigh 54.5 kg. I am so thin and 1.65 m tall. I have a history of mental illness leading me to anorexia but it has nothing to do with these ideal masculine features. Things are getting better now since I used to weigh 50 kg last year. I don&#39;t have a restrictive diet or excess training. I don&#39;t go to the gym at all. I lift dumbbells and play with tools at work since they are quite heavy sometimes. I can say that I am happy the way I am right now, especially that I gained muscle. I am so happy that I don&#39;t follow these celebrities or actors. My masculinity depends not on my bodily features, but on my personality traits. Our society defines masculinity either by becoming a gigachad or being an abusive father/husband figure. I have been taunted about my long curly hair, my use of vitamin supplements and sunscreen, my not so low-pitched voice and my lack of interest in dating and insulting. I am far from the perfect male image and I know it. Believe me, fixing it isn&#39;t an easy way..; Good video but I disagree with the negative view of working out and exercise. What movie stars and celebrities go through is not what gym goers and PTs will advise. Working out doesn&#39;t have to be extreme and it is uncomfortable in the beginning because you are putting your body through a movement and resistance that it isn&#39;t used to. I would still recommend it; Interesting post. I stumbled upon your video, as I was looking at the whole subject of body dysmorphia. I have a nephew, who has recently started going to the gym, and he was telling me that he has been offered performance enhancing drugs. He has already bought into every supplement on the market - including that Athletic Green nonsense - and is impatient about making what he calls &#39;massive gains&#39;. <br>I&#39;m assured he has rejected the offers thus far, but have been looking around to find alternative interpretations of masculinity, in an attempt to allow him to set realistic goals. <br>Most honest coaches, or influencers will tell you that  - for natural lifters - 95% of making progress in any physical endeavour is consistent hard work, along with a healthy diet, where supplements (the clue is in the name) are just the cherry on top. <br>Alas, nowadays, everything has to happen yesterday, or we just give up and move on. Added to the mix, is the amount of bandwidth dedicated to charlatans  employing a variety of misrepresentations to part us with from our precious time and money. Thank you for sharing.; Asian men are in a more worse situation in the West because they&#39;re perceived to be shorter and weaker from the start😢; Dude you&#39;re so wrong about South African advertising bro. I&#39;m a South African, was born here and have lived here for over 30 years. My dude let me tell you, white people don&#39;t feature in advertising and haven&#39;t for a good 10 years mate 😂; La roca es simplemente feo; Men have had considerably higher standards put on them for awhile. Look at how women overtook male obesity rates in 2015 and how the gap has widened; I was working with a mental health company as their head of marketing based in UK run by an Arab expat.<br><br>The CEO once told me “from now on, let’s hire people from South Africa. They are cheaper and many of them still look like white people so they’re more presentable on camera”<br><br>He also said to me “Indians are lazy and ugly” or “white people are just more hard working” etc.<br><br>I quit a month after that.; I find you intellectually dishonest. You failed to mention how women view men and how that view shapes the self esteem of many men. In another video you mentioned how beauty standards are patriarchal but you never place any responsibility on women. That makes you a bigot and an appalling person. If you sticked your head out of your asshole for a couple hours, you would see that past generations don&#39;t have the masculinity standards that you&#39;re attributing to them. Your generation it&#39;s ideologically brainwashed to the point you can&#39;t see reality for what it is. There are no enemies around every corner, gender roles are not misogynistic and masculinity is not a straight jacket. Give it a thought, and don&#39;t mind the language, you have also been very inconsiderate with different opinions.; Thank God for this!; Your physicque matters man put in the work....... you&#39;ll rest when you are dead😂😂; I&#39;m shocked men even have beauty standards. It&#39;s usually all about the women.; Here is a quote from the late Zsa Zsa Gabor: &quot;Men have always liked me and I have always liked men. But I like a mannish man, a man who knows how to talk to and treat a woman—not just a man with muscles.&quot; And to think that she was a socialite just like the Kardashians. Just from this quote alone, Gabor seemed more down to earth than that entire family.; How much of the desire to look a particular way is driven by a desire to look like an actor and how much is about women wanting men that look that way? I don’t think most people want to do what it takes to look like a cover model. And most woman don’t want a man that looks that way either, so why dose it end up being the “ideal”?; Well done and said.; I think this guy is jus demotivating. I like the idea that I shouldn&#39;t be happy were I am and to always strive for more. Having ambition is great. This guy was draggin everything he said, Its really not that hard you just have to stop being a snowflake and take action.; Yeah, but still exercise, don&#39;t stop; For me, It was my weight and it is my body. I used to be overweight, and it felt really bad, nobody told me anything directly but I could feel their disgust in their looks. I got tired of this and I lost 15 kilos and I became skinny, then I started to go to the gym to gain muscle, I had a girlfriend and I felt that my life was perfect. Then, that relationship ended and I felt like shit. I saw my body and even though I wasn&#39;t overweight anymore I still wasn&#39;t satisfied with my body. Right now I&#39;m 17 years old, and I&#39;m going to be 18 in December, my problem is that I don&#39;t look like it, the majority of people tell me that I look way younger than I am, almost like a kid, and that really hit on me because I feel like nobody takes me seriously. I am skinny, 5&#39;7 (170cm) ,and I have a kid-like face. It affects me most when I look in the mirror, is like someone is stalking me but it&#39;s only my own mind playing games on me; Many Kpop male stars just imitate Black American R&amp;B artist and rap starts in their dancing all the way to the clothing, mannerism, charm etc. Of course with Korean sauce on it but the fundament is clearly AMERICAN !; Men struggle with self image, body dysmorphia and eating disorders too. And we also feel the pressure to be strong, fast and smart at the same time we are completely dehydrated with a 8% bodyfat.; as a woman, I started thinking about all the standard beauty we are surrounded by. and the fact that we see siz abs are attractive and like everyone wanna go to the gym and get these abs.  but is it healthy or for shape. <br>men also have to be aware about what is gioning on because even they are get brain washed too.; Hahaha. don&#39;t care about them, I just want to be fit, I don&#39;t really want a damn abs cuz it&#39;s very hard to maintain but having a normal fit body is just damn awesome for me.; You talked a lot about body and muscles and forgot about the eurocentric hair, where straight and brilliant is beautiful, the nose has to be small and thin, big lips, blue eyes are very admired etc; I am gay and Filipino, I have light skin, short stature and full cheeks. I wear masculine outifts. And when I joined the hook up culture at the age of 24, I have never felt this empty and extremely insecure because I look so young and I hate it, I have an Asian nose. Not ripped, weigh 120 lbs (5&#39;4&quot;). I just can&#39;t fucking keep up with the beauty standards among the LGBT community here in the Ph🇵🇭. This is slowly killing my already low self-confidence; Yeah! I admit in a lot of area there is always an average tendency in general,, for what people feel more attractive, however it should not be a force that is imposed in any specific human beings in actual reality; I&#39;m really disappointed you talked so little about steroids when they are incredibly common in the fitness industry and incredibly harmful both physically and mentally; As a girl this is a very big eye opener. I never realized how much guys go through body image things. It wasn’t until I realized my cousins and my brothers talking about their bodies in a “joking” way. I then realized that that guys and girls are actually the same in lots of ways (well I realized it before just not to this extent). Also I think that people focus so much on female body positivity is cause women are usually focused on their bodies more than men (not all the time but for the most part yeah) and cause women are over sexualized in the media. We really need to start pushing healthy body positivity in people cause if we keep following beauty trends we’re only setting ourselves and future generations up for mental issues; What if i train and do exercise and become happy with my own body and feel healthy; this is why I never want to be famous. my nonexistent self confidence would plummet 📉📉📉; These sh.tty a§§ beauty standards gotta stop! 😭😭😭😭; every person have some body confidence issues, now i understand that my brothers are sad some days, they always say im a beauty trans girl, they reforce my confidence and I forget to give back 💚; Its sad...and Tinder, ig , how then man with normal body type can have dates?; Gotta push back at the wrong idea that beauty standards is connected to colonialism. there is  a reason this idea just became popular, because it took that long for a PHD in Sociology isolated from the world to come up with it.  In reality, Americans have gotten fatter, dumpier, and dress worse and worse, while our European counterparts have kept up.  So now people are looking to Russia and Poland etc. for hotties.  This is rooted in NOW not 200+ years ago; So una must gym before una get muscle for Niger push wheelbarrow for one week if you nor get pac like that men need to be muscular it&#39;s a must if girls don&#39;t have muscles and boys don&#39;t have won&#39;t it look awkward I have three brothers none of them has ever entered the gym it&#39;s because u whites have too much equipment and technology no stress that&#39;s why you need to starve to get abs my brothers eat alot but they all have six pac; Fat or skinny men aren&#39;t attractive. The male beauty standard stayed the same in all of human history for a reason.; Personally, the &quot;real men&quot; stigma hurts the people around me. I&#39;ve seen my young and older brothers fall victim to that sort of stuff, it&#39;s hard to watch especially since an 8 year old is not choosing pink to wear (even though it is his favourite colour) due to the misogynistic society we live in.; “Some straight men think it’s feminine to recycle”  💀; So necessary this video!; you forgot to mention high heels were worn by aristocratic men in the victorian era; Everyone’s suffering from beauty standards 🥲; asian want white, western want dark skin, everyone want what they can not have; As a trans man, I am constantly told that I am not a &quot;real man&quot; or that I need to be ultra masculine to be accepted as a man. It sucks, because I&#39;m afraid to be feminine, to cry, to talk about my feelings because people always invalidate me when I do that. They say &quot;now that you are a man, you have to act like a man&quot; or &quot;I thought you were a man?&quot;. I&#39;ll never be good enough for this people because most of them don&#39;t even see me as a guy in the first place.; Amazing Job! A lot has changed in america since I was younger, and super skinny rockers were the hot cool men.; We all knew Henry Cavill would pop into this video 😂 Ngl I have many insecurities; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m attractive most girls shy away from me or just aren&#39;t interested and men get touchy and all wanna fuck with me...(I&#39;m not gay and I get so much uncomfortable it got to the point of me slapping an older person because he was very touchy 🤮🤮🤮). I&#39;m very confused and I don&#39;t know how to feel .; Good video but it was missing an important beauty standard for men: dick size. If you don&#39;t have a large weiner, you are not considered attractive, period. Society makes it feel like you will never find a partner who will genuinely like you because of it. It is socially acceptable to make fun of guys with smaller dicks and its incredibly hurtful to males who actually have smaller ones. It causes extreme damage to self esteem and makes us feel worthless(yes I am on the low-end of average).; As my husband often says: &quot;Gender equality was NOT about telling men they need to adhere to bullshit beauty standards as well, but rather the opposite!&quot;; Thanks so much! I am a school counselor and I´m sharing your videos with my older students.; Just to be a bit more truthful..being overweight has NEVER been a sign of masculine beauty <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> ; it was indeed a sign you were probably rich and had a higher status ( not always, as poor overweight chaps did exist and people did know), which is a very different thing. Consider ancient male sculpture: since pharaonic Egypt, classical Greece, or imperial Rome, a V-shaped torso and lean and muscular body has ALWAYS been considered attractive. What you&#39;re showing here, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> are bodily FASHION trends, fads that come and go and were rarely, if ever,  considered a standard of beauty and have been ridiculed and mocked, sometimes even at the moment they were in their peak and always since.

He runs an average of 15 miles every day and goes to the gym to work his upper body doing things like handstand pushups. And yet, he looks nothing like the chiseled men you see on social media. He has plenty of fat to support his muscles and you can&#39;t see his abs at all. Having all of your muscles exposed like bodybuilders is just a sign of starvation imo. It&#39;s ridiculous that this is seen as the peak male body.; Wait a second is that bit of music in the beginning from Splatoon (1) lobby&#39;s in between match waiting page...?; Im Hindu American and I always liked men from India who are Hindus.  I love Hinduism and Indian culture and I love going to Hindu temple.  I wanted to meet a man from India who love Hinduism, Indian culture and going to Hindu temple.<br>I didnt care if he was short or tall, fair or dark skinned, average weight, thin or even overweight.<br>But I was too shy and it never happened.; sexual selection means you want to fuck the people you find attractive <br><br>aocial media bombards you with options and leaves you feeling eternally aware of shortcomings in any potential partner you meet<br><br>our brains cant handle that much information, a local community is already enough <br><br>delete social media, become yourself. <br><br>you might be a bit more isolated, but those who respect your decision and those who enter your life afterwards are more likely to be valuable that whoever you attract with your photoshopped abs and projected supreme ideal personality<br><br>quality &gt; quantity; We also have to add on that the way movie stars represent getting fit is way outside the norm.<br>They often have poor trainers, no idea themselves what they are doing and extreme goals they have to archive in a short time. Most of them have to take Peds to meet them at all. <br>This is not representative if you take your time and are smart and consistent.<br>You can make incredible improvements in the span of a year.<br>It takes consistency and knowledge but nothing extreme; Well ahead of the curve; Does Efron think that there&#39;s only carbs in bread and pasta?

They&#39;re not like women who will parade about body positivity and &#39;unrealistic&#39; standards.<br><br>It&#39;s fiction, men know some of it is unachievable, but they still strive to achieve that physique. These physiques, will looking unrealistic, take insane amounts of sacrifice and discipline. These actors and models simply do not want to put time into it outside of their roles, and that&#39;s why they regress. I use the male beauty standards as a guide to what I want, and I&#39;m currently on track to my dream physique, fully clean, no roids.<br><br>It takes time, effort, sacrifice and discipline to achieve it, but saying it&#39;s bogus is honestly retarded.; Revelation 12:17<br><br>17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.; ⛔  Natural muscular body is Vigintillion time better than some shitty Obesity, Diabetes patient, couch potato pathetic weak humans. 🚫<br><br>🔸Yes, say no to anabolic steroid.<br><br>🔸But if you can achieve good healthy natural aesthetic physique with proper workout, nutrition and rest.<br><br>🔸Then it will be millions time, not even vigintillion times better than some average American shitty couch potatoes obesity patient who eats unhealthy pizza, burger, soft drinks all day long sitting on sofa watching sitcoms TV serials, netflix.<br><br>🔸To stay healthy and fit we need to stay motivated to work hard, to maintain healthy discipline lifestyle.  <br><br>🔸 That&#39;s why we need to have an ideal perfect image in our brain. <br><br>🔸That doesn&#39;t always means you have to achieve exactly similar ideal result.

Most dudes need to get in way better shape and should be muscular. To get Biebers level is doable for anybody.  Biebers body is the lowest god damn level you should ever aim for. The real problem is most people just arent willing to do what it takes.  They think its unrealistic to do that much to get a body image they want. The dude with no shirt on doesnt suffer from body dysmorphia because if he did he wouldnt be doing an interview without his shirt on like that.  I think we hold people to too low of standard now in everything. If you cant make a 100k a year and cant be at least beiber level or excel at something than you gotta blame yourself. Its healthy to be critical and take on problems. Its unhealthy to accept a low standard for yourself.; Funny how mens &quot;health&quot; tend to put body builders in their frontpage. But they abuse the shit out of peds; There&#39;s a massive other cause behind this that no one wants to admit which is that multiple studies have shown that women find like 80-90% of men unattractive. Nothing motivates men more than women, if men feel like they have to use steroids and starve themselves to look good enough for a partner, they&#39;ll do it.; Thank you. Great video.; Why some people think that if a man wears something &quot;feminine&quot; it means they&#39;re gay??? Gay men can be &quot;masculine&quot; and still be gay as well straight men can be &quot;feminine&quot; and still be straight, how someone dress or act or look like it&#39;s not because of their sexuality! When will people understand that?; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> my idea of a handsome attractive ideal man is very hairy, a little chunky, and soft featured, so... very much subjective and beauty standards don&#39;t mean shit because some people are gonna think you&#39;re ugly and some people are gonna think you&#39;re very attractive; the truth is most men will never be a girls erotic dream<br>so dont beat yourselves up dudes<br>it just wasnt meant to be<br>go j3rk off and wait til this shitshow called life ends; Meanwhile in reality young women are all over Benedict Cumberbach, Dylan O&#39;Brien and Tom Holland.; An average healthy long lasting body as shown during the 1960&#39;s phase is what people should maintain as far as i feel. Being too fat is unhealthy being too much unnaturally big and muscular is also as unhealthy as being fat as it is taxing to the mental health as well as to the body, But its ok if you are some trainer some where and that is all you do all day.; Thank you so much💐🙏; &quot;Extreme diet&quot; they&#39;re eating disorders. Makes me really sad that men are never spoken about regarding these issues. :(; Great video; And people think WOMEN get objectified. Men get it way worse and NO ONE talks about it; Your voice tone and body language are painful to watch it&#39;s too gay; One of the most shocking, those chests of actors, models etc are the result of PEDs and a breast reduction surgery.; It’s the fact that things 100 years ago were deemed attractive and now are deemed unattractive that makes the whole beauty thing completely fabricated and terrible to base your life around. Your mental and physical health should be your priority and with women it’s just a matter of bettering yourself to engage in a healthy relationship after that the standards are completely meaningless.; One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that no one ever talks about stuff like this from a skinny guys perpesctive its always from the perspective of being chubby <br>Its so damaging hearing all these people telling you that being skinny or chubby makes you less of a man and getting jacked is the only way to get the girl and the life you want. I think this leads young guys to start taking performance enhancing drugs which will ultimately killl them its terrible i cant believe its turned to this; yeah no one really ever talks about how male beauty standards effect men. everyone is always one about how they effect women and &quot;especially teenage girls&quot; when they browse instagram, completely ignoring men and boys in the equation who are definitely no less effected by it.<br>an example of this erasure from top of my head is this post I saw in pinterest not too long ago. wall has 2 entrances, one is just a large square hole for men and perfect babrie cutout for women.<br>but with all the body positive talk going on and how &quot;its not a movement for men!!&quot; it feels more like its the square hole for women and perfect arnold cutout for men.; a woman really don&#39;t need extreme face pack like bolywood heroes and it&#39;s also show woman as not independent we don&#39;t need your over facepack major body with fair skin man; The ridiculous &quot;men&quot; haircuts are truly a shitty sight to behold. They look stupid. The way we associated long hair with women is the reason we now have binary people who think if they are a woman and wear short hair, they can become men. These simpleminded stupid ideas should not be given any energy.; I do not wanna look like that. Like those bearded weird creatures. And because i reject that i have a lot of success with women. Sure, i am very tall, that helps. But the truth is that i have found my OWN look, and i tell you that this male selfimproovement movement is pure masturbation. And the result looks ridiculous. I dont wanna look like a castrated ox, like these weird bodybuilders. Blech; Whay BS. If you are not committed, then don&#39;t do it nor expect others to change for you.

Grazie!!; It&#39;s funny how westerners think of India as a spiritual and tolerant place with a relatively benign dominant religion, whereas in reality they are just as racist, misogynistic and homophobic as you would expect from a poor nation.; I have an eating disorder. It&#39;s has nothing to do with body image, picking up women, or any of that nonsense. <br>I&#39;m simply too lazy to eat 🤷🏽‍♂️; Looking like those celebrities is unrealistic but you also need to look your best your body can make as well.; I am 20 yo man and I weigh 54.5 kg. I am so thin and 1.65 m tall. I have a history of mental illness leading me to anorexia but it has nothing to do with these ideal masculine features. Things are getting better now since I used to weigh 50 kg last year. I don&#39;t have a restrictive diet or excess training. I don&#39;t go to the gym at all. I lift dumbbells and play with tools at work since they are quite heavy sometimes. I can say that I am happy the way I am right now, especially that I gained muscle. I am so happy that I don&#39;t follow these celebrities or actors. My masculinity depends not on my bodily features, but on my personality traits. Our society defines masculinity either by becoming a gigachad or being an abusive father/husband figure. I have been taunted about my long curly hair, my use of vitamin supplements and sunscreen, my not so low-pitched voice and my lack of interest in dating and insulting. I am far from the perfect male image and I know it. Believe me, fixing it isn&#39;t an easy way..; Good video but I disagree with the negative view of working out and exercise. What movie stars and celebrities go through is not what gym goers and PTs will advise. Working out doesn&#39;t have to be extreme and it is uncomfortable in the beginning because you are putting your body through a movement and resistance that it isn&#39;t used to. I would still recommend it; Interesting post. I stumbled upon your video, as I was looking at the whole subject of body dysmorphia. I have a nephew, who has recently started going to the gym, and he was telling me that he has been offered performance enhancing drugs. He has already bought into every supplement on the market - including that Athletic Green nonsense - and is impatient about making what he calls &#39;massive gains&#39;. <br>I&#39;m assured he has rejected the offers thus far, but have been looking around to find alternative interpretations of masculinity, in an attempt to allow him to set realistic goals. <br>Most honest coaches, or influencers will tell you that  - for natural lifters - 95% of making progress in any physical endeavour is consistent hard work, along with a healthy diet, where supplements (the clue is in the name) are just the cherry on top. <br>Alas, nowadays, everything has to happen yesterday, or we just give up and move on. Added to the mix, is the amount of bandwidth dedicated to charlatans  employing a variety of misrepresentations to part us with from our precious time and money.

I admit in a lot of area there is always an average tendency in general,, for what people feel more attractive, however it should not be a force that is imposed in any specific human beings in actual reality; I&#39;m really disappointed you talked so little about steroids when they are incredibly common in the fitness industry and incredibly harmful both physically and mentally; As a girl this is a very big eye opener. I never realized how much guys go through body image things. It wasn’t until I realized my cousins and my brothers talking about their bodies in a “joking” way. I then realized that that guys and girls are actually the same in lots of ways (well I realized it before just not to this extent). Also I think that people focus so much on female body positivity is cause women are usually focused on their bodies more than men (not all the time but for the most part yeah) and cause women are over sexualized in the media. We really need to start pushing healthy body positivity in people cause if we keep following beauty trends we’re only setting ourselves and future generations up for mental issues; What if i train and do exercise and become happy with my own body and feel healthy; this is why I never want to be famous. my nonexistent self confidence would plummet 📉📉📉; These sh.tty a§§ beauty standards gotta stop! 😭😭😭😭; every person have some body confidence issues, now i understand that my brothers are sad some days, they always say im a beauty trans girl, they reforce my confidence and I forget to give back 💚; Its sad...and Tinder, ig , how then man with normal body type can have dates?; Gotta push back at the wrong idea that beauty standards is connected to colonialism. there is  a reason this idea just became popular, because it took that long for a PHD in Sociology isolated from the world to come up with it.  In reality, Americans have gotten fatter, dumpier, and dress worse and worse, while our European counterparts have kept up.  So now people are looking to Russia and Poland etc. for hotties.  This is rooted in NOW not 200+ years ago; So una must gym before una get muscle for Niger push wheelbarrow for one week if you nor get pac like that men need to be muscular it&#39;s a must if girls don&#39;t have muscles and boys don&#39;t have won&#39;t it look awkward I have three brothers none of them has ever entered the gym it&#39;s because u whites have too much equipment and technology no stress that&#39;s why you need to starve to get abs my brothers eat alot but they all have six pac; Fat or skinny men aren&#39;t attractive. The male beauty standard stayed the same in all of human history for a reason.; Personally, the &quot;real men&quot; stigma hurts the people around me. I&#39;ve seen my young and older brothers fall victim to that sort of stuff, it&#39;s hard to watch especially since an 8 year old is not choosing pink to wear (even though it is his favourite colour) due to the misogynistic society we live in.; “Some straight men think it’s feminine to recycle”  💀; So necessary this video!; you forgot to mention high heels were worn by aristocratic men in the victorian era; Everyone’s suffering from beauty standards 🥲; asian want white, western want dark skin, everyone want what they can not have; As a trans man, I am constantly told that I am not a &quot;real man&quot; or that I need to be ultra masculine to be accepted as a man. It sucks, because I&#39;m afraid to be feminine, to cry, to talk about my feelings because people always invalidate me when I do that. They say &quot;now that you are a man, you have to act like a man&quot; or &quot;I thought you were a man?&quot;. I&#39;ll never be good enough for this people because most of them don&#39;t even see me as a guy in the first place.; Amazing Job! A lot has changed in america since I was younger, and super skinny rockers were the hot cool men.; We all knew Henry Cavill would pop into this video 😂 Ngl I have many insecurities; I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m attractive most girls shy away from me or just aren&#39;t interested and men get touchy and all wanna fuck with me...(I&#39;m not gay and I get so much uncomfortable it got to the point of me slapping an older person because he was very touchy 🤮🤮🤮). I&#39;m very confused and I don&#39;t know how to feel .; Good video but it was missing an important beauty standard for men: dick size. If you don&#39;t have a large weiner, you are not considered attractive, period. Society makes it feel like you will never find a partner who will genuinely like you because of it. It is socially acceptable to make fun of guys with smaller dicks and its incredibly hurtful to males who actually have smaller ones. It causes extreme damage to self esteem and makes us feel worthless(yes I am on the low-end of average).; As my husband often says: &quot;Gender equality was NOT about telling men they need to adhere to bullshit beauty standards as well, but rather the opposite!&quot;; Thanks so much! I am a school counselor and I´m sharing your videos with my older students.; Just to be a bit more truthful..being overweight has NEVER been a sign of masculine beauty <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> ; it was indeed a sign you were probably rich and had a higher status ( not always, as poor overweight chaps did exist and people did know), which is a very different thing. Consider ancient male sculpture: since pharaonic Egypt, classical Greece, or imperial Rome, a V-shaped torso and lean and muscular body has ALWAYS been considered attractive. What you&#39;re showing here, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDG6Fj9X0Y4&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> are bodily FASHION trends, fads that come and go and were rarely, if ever,  considered a standard of beauty and have been ridiculed and mocked, sometimes even at the moment they were in their peak and always since.

kpop is destroying your brain,zoeunlimited,2023-01-19T20:00:12Z,kpop is destroying your brain and self image. Grow with me mentally and physically. Become a patron: https://zunlimited.co/ ...,noS2robWQP0,"PART 2 OUT: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLBJiI2J5l4"">https://youtu.be/XLBJiI2J5l4</a> How has kpop influenced YOU?; &quot;Abhorrent&quot;, not, &quot;abhorring&quot;...; I feel alot of these Also depends on the company you apply for. The lower or higher the company, the worst the idol treatment. But companies in the middle like  KQ entertainment, treat their idols like humans; no it isn&#39;t; The beauty products actually work. <br>Korean beauty products I’ve used when I was in my teenage years was the best I’ve ever used. <br>I had very little pores . <br>No spots and smooth soft skin. <br><br>But yeah … what else can you do? <br>They are idols. Giving kids hope of a better life if you are born perfect , with talent and natural beauty and when you fart a halo should shine!; Chinese society as well! I felt rly insecure sometimes; &quot;200 pound beauty&quot; movie literally showed the dark side of kpop industry... The amount of toxicity and beauty standard in Korean industry is unimaginable...; Life has taught me never listen to people with half half hair color. They are manipulative, egotistical, and sometimes just straight up evil. It shows mental anguish and mental instability.; True, which is why I stopped being invested into the culture. I hear the songs here and there and that&#39;s it. The community isn&#39;t much better.; K pop is CANCER; Learning to dance and sing is hard, but it is not over 1 year hard... The extra years is mostly just to put the kids in debt to their employer. I would argue.; I think everything we see in kpop is scripted <br>Even the slightest <br>How they move, eat, react and all.; You look like a kpop star; i can 100% say when i became a kpop stan my self image changed so drastically it&#39;s genuinely so sad. i had never been more insecure in my body than i was as a kpop stan. it didn&#39;t help that o became a kpop stan in 2017 when i was 13 almost 14 and went through a lot on high school because of it; Gurl... <b>I&#39;m speechless</b>; I hate k Pop; What&#39;s the movie in the beauty standard part ?; Deuteronomy 31:8<br>Do not feel afraid or discouraged for the LORD will personally go ahead of you he will be with you he will neither fail you nor abandoned you; As a man who doesn&#39;t follow K-Pop and have only seen music videos passively while eating at restaurants and always thought there was something of an uncanny valley aspect to it, this video made me feel kind of nauseous; A 5&quot;4 woman should not be 170 pounds though<br>110, maybe. Not 170. That&#39;s SIX heavy BAGS of POTATOES extra!!!; If anyone thinks talent alone isn’t enough to be successful, they haven’t heard of Ado; if you couldn&#39;t take one look at k-pop and see it was a bunch of toxic b.s. vanity, you weren&#39;t raised properly; According to the formula I’d have to be 83 pounds… 💀💀💀 my lowest I’ve ever been was 120 and my face was already looking pretty skeletal at that point… and I was that weight twice, the first because of chronic illness the second because of a medication that made me not hungry so I was forgetting to eat.<br><br>Edit: according to a BMI calculator it’d be 15. A BMI under 18 is considered underweight.; YES ----PART 2!!!....THIS WAS BRILLIANT, ZOE!!; NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WHEN THEY COLLAPSE...; Never liked k pop really; Anyone please name of the movie in between about that plastic surgery; I don’t know anything about K-pop, but they should add in enthusiasm for procreation to the proud of heritage part. That would be based.; lol if I were to use the weight formula on myself I would have to be 29kg 😭😭 wtf; 다른 사람들은 한국 KPOP 아이돌 소년 조항이 여자친구가 있다고 생각합니다. 왜냐하면 이 bch 소녀가 아이돌의 삶을 파괴하기 때문입니다. 평판. 여자친구가 전혀 없습니다. 소녀들은 성가신 사람들입니다.; 😂😂모든 케이팝 아이돌은 방탄소년단과 같은 미인으로 통하지만, 더 많은 여자 아이돌의 아름다움은 가짜이고 진짜가 아닙니다. 어떤 아이돌은 원래 잘생기게 태어났지만 이런 헛소리를 할 필요가 없습니다. 다른 사람들은 이런 짓을 하고 같은 여자들을 두고 스스로를 파괴합니다.; Till we found NewJeans; The Western ideology of self distruction of society is even worse.; i dont get the lack of loyalty to the favorite groups though, all my favorite artists ive loved for years and even if theyve kinda exited rotation, ima still listen to a new drop or whatever, its not like a new group makes an old group not good anymore; Have you ever looked closely at most Korean celebrity’s teeth? They look similar, “perfect” but oddly unnatural, right? It’s because most of them get their natural, healthy teeth shaved down to smaller stubs and place caps on them. In fact they often joke that they have to be careful or their caps will fall out 😮 <br>Anyway, if we look at all this with a western lens, every single company producing idols would be in deep waters for breaking child labor laws and abuse.; Sad to say it&#39;s true, without realisation whenever I see kpop idols visuals I&#39;d feel more insecure of my how my nose look or my eyes, my body everything. I tend to avoid seeing kpop content or anything related to kpop.; The problem is that some of those &quot;idols&quot; themselves actually enjoy and wanna go through all of what you say... while telling their fans how big such victims they were. Most of them have little talents. They were even picked bc of how permissive and obedient they would be for the training process. Those that dont play dumb enough would not make the end. They personally are responsible for the toxicity of the industry. They may even manipulate fans on company behalf and it has nothing to do w music or art, or for fans&#39; benefits.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS2robWQP0&amp;t=546"">9:06</a>😳; Only girls care about K-pop lol<br>For boys many of us are not interested; Obviously nothing against the actual idols but this is why I can&#39;t support the Kpop industry anymore. I was a fan of BTS and Bigbang well before Kpop blew up internationally. I was literally the only one in school who knew about kpop hahaha..<br>I don&#39;t support it as much now because of the industry.. How they overwork the idols, put pressure on them for beauty etc etc. In some contracts they aren&#39;t allowed to date too.. Henry Prince Mak made a &quot;expose&quot; video about the industry and called the contracts &quot;slave contracts&quot;.; KPOP KOREAN generational brainwash 101 . Love it, but what it is doing to modern culture is diabolical; As someone that has listened to kpop since 2007, it&#39;s been so interesting to see how much is has grown into the global sensation it is today. But, with that, all of the issues with the beauty standards and treatment of idols have become even more obvious. I remember conversations online between 2000-2010 about how much stress and toxicity surrounded the fan culture for kpop and how dangerous it was for idols to deal with that, but I feel like it has only gotten worse over the years.; When I was in the kpop world doing covers, I learned that 50kg and up is considered fat in Korea so I worked hard to live to that standard. Now at 38yo, I still feel fat when I see a 50+ on the scale. It really messed up my brain! 😥; Hello what movie or show is being shown at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS2robWQP0&amp;t=617"">10:17</a> mark?; Just from reading all the comments, I guess those of us going into this world only for the music are rare.  At first I was annoyed with all the negativity but considering how many young impressionable kids get influenced by this culture, I can see the validity of this video.  My teens aren’t into k-pop as much as I am but if they are I would guide them about what’s real and what’s illusion.  Hopefully your video will help people get into k-pop more educated, self aware and less toxic.; I don&#39;t listen to K-pop really. My music taste is pretty underground compared to most Gen Z children. 😂; Using american women as the average is scewing the numbers.; I sometimes wonder what the fate of plus size people, who are talented and equally desire to be celebrities, would be like in Kpop industry.<br><br>Does it mean that they don&#39;t deserve to be on the spotlight like these skiny ones? It doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Let&#39;s all keep talking against these dehumanizing practices, in whatever position we find ourselves.<br><br>Shouting louder for all to hear and see, gradually more people will start saying no to these so called companies, <br><br>Next generation of companies will be influenced into having better and more healthier standards.<br><br>One that allows you to be the human, you are with talent.; The worst thing is very young teenagers such 10yo or less start doing make and lost confidence of them at such a young age. My daughter classmate start at 9, her skin was beautiful before and now she can’t even go out without makeup… and she’s only 13yo 😢; Everything is a &quot;Concept&quot;; 팩트는 미국 비만율이 70%를 넘겼다는거임. 우리가 볼땐 니들이 이상해; 또또 pc질 하면서 조회수 끈다. 뭐든 탑분야가 되기 위해서는 그만큼 노력이 필요한거야. 반도체든 ai든 원전이든 심지어 케이팝 산업까지 다 똑같아. pc먹은 디즈니와 마블이 어떻게 됐지? 왜 자꾸 역사를 잊지? 우리 케이팝까지 망치지 말아줘. 방구석에서 시어머니짓은 누가 못하냐? 케이팝 아이돌들의 노력의 반의반이라도 해라. 남의 노력 깎아내리지말고; What movie is this girl in that had surgery???; Heey that’s my fave movie 200pounds of beauty from 10 mins onwards. There is a nice song in the movie, “Dance with my daddy”.; I find artists that write their lyrics and music more interesting. The fact that this is all just a big production is not appealing; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS2robWQP0&amp;t=407"">6:47</a> I would be a whopping 70lbs because of how short I am…Don’t get me wrong, I’m overweight. Quite a bit. But 70lbs is the size of a literal child.; I got into kpop when I&#39;m in middle school so basically still a kid. For some reason, it doesn&#39;t really affect me. I feel ugly, yes. But not because of kpop. I don&#39;t compare myself to the idols because I see them as some kind of mythical gods/goddesses and I, mere mortal wouldn&#39;t be able to look like them even if it&#39;s only a little bit. <br>Guess my low self-esteem saved me from this. Idk if it&#39;s good or not. <br>Nowadays, I basically already gave up on anything. Friends, dating, looking good? Whatever. Nothing&#39;s worth fighting for. <br>I&#39;ll just mindlessly consume entertainment like kpop to escape from my real life. It&#39;s not that my real life is absolute hell but idk. I&#39;m bored with everything. Nothing matters. <br>I&#39;m not really into kpop nowadays though. The songs they made isn&#39;t my taste anymore.; This come down to one thing. If girls can&#39;t be fat, it&#39;s horrible. But this is nothing new or unusual. People don&#39;t know how to eat right to maintain weight.; The WEIGHT ID BE 45 LBS😭😩I’d DIE; Honestly I don’t even know how bts is so popular 😂; I don’t think there’s anything as tough as being a trainee in Korea 😂😂😂 lol ! <br>1. Russian gulag<br>2. Nazi occupied country<br>3. Conscription in Ukraine <br>4. Wore torn Syria<br>5. Women in Afghanistan<br>Need I go on ?😮; 171lbs for 5&#39; 4&quot; person is obese. 😒; Well no I never thought that because I didn’t care 😂; If anyone else is searching for where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS2robWQP0&amp;t=1310"">21:50</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS2robWQP0&amp;t=1427"">23:47</a> (among others) are from, it&#39;s likely footage from the 9MUSES documentary, specifically from when they were filming their MV for &quot;No Playboy&quot;.

I felt rly insecure sometimes; &quot;200 pound beauty&quot; movie literally showed the dark side of kpop industry... The amount of toxicity and beauty standard in Korean industry is unimaginable...; Life has taught me never listen to people with half half hair color. They are manipulative, egotistical, and sometimes just straight up evil. It shows mental anguish and mental instability.; True, which is why I stopped being invested into the culture. I hear the songs here and there and that&#39;s it. The community isn&#39;t much better.; K pop is CANCER; Learning to dance and sing is hard, but it is not over 1 year hard...

They look similar, “perfect” but oddly unnatural, right? It’s because most of them get their natural, healthy teeth shaved down to smaller stubs and place caps on them. In fact they often joke that they have to be careful or their caps will fall out 😮 <br>Anyway, if we look at all this with a western lens, every single company producing idols would be in deep waters for breaking child labor laws and abuse.; Sad to say it&#39;s true, without realisation whenever I see kpop idols visuals I&#39;d feel more insecure of my how my nose look or my eyes, my body everything. I tend to avoid seeing kpop content or anything related to kpop.; The problem is that some of those &quot;idols&quot; themselves actually enjoy and wanna go through all of what you say... while telling their fans how big such victims they were. Most of them have little talents. They were even picked bc of how permissive and obedient they would be for the training process. Those that dont play dumb enough would not make the end.

Love it, but what it is doing to modern culture is diabolical; As someone that has listened to kpop since 2007, it&#39;s been so interesting to see how much is has grown into the global sensation it is today. But, with that, all of the issues with the beauty standards and treatment of idols have become even more obvious. I remember conversations online between 2000-2010 about how much stress and toxicity surrounded the fan culture for kpop and how dangerous it was for idols to deal with that, but I feel like it has only gotten worse over the years.; When I was in the kpop world doing covers, I learned that 50kg and up is considered fat in Korea so I worked hard to live to that standard.

Hopefully your video will help people get into k-pop more educated, self aware and less toxic.; I don&#39;t listen to K-pop really. My music taste is pretty underground compared to most Gen Z children. 😂; Using american women as the average is scewing the numbers.; I sometimes wonder what the fate of plus size people, who are talented and equally desire to be celebrities, would be like in Kpop industry.<br><br>Does it mean that they don&#39;t deserve to be on the spotlight like these skiny ones? It doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Let&#39;s all keep talking against these dehumanizing practices, in whatever position we find ourselves.<br><br>Shouting louder for all to hear and see, gradually more people will start saying no to these so called companies, <br><br>Next generation of companies will be influenced into having better and more healthier standards.<br><br>One that allows you to be the human, you are with talent.; The worst thing is very young teenagers such 10yo or less start doing make and lost confidence of them at such a young age.

Quite a bit. But 70lbs is the size of a literal child.; I got into kpop when I&#39;m in middle school so basically still a kid. For some reason, it doesn&#39;t really affect me. I feel ugly, yes. But not because of kpop. I don&#39;t compare myself to the idols because I see them as some kind of mythical gods/goddesses and I, mere mortal wouldn&#39;t be able to look like them even if it&#39;s only a little bit. <br>Guess my low self-esteem saved me from this. Idk if it&#39;s good or not. <br>Nowadays, I basically already gave up on anything. Friends, dating, looking good? Whatever. Nothing&#39;s worth fighting for. <br>I&#39;ll just mindlessly consume entertainment like kpop to escape from my real life. It&#39;s not that my real life is absolute hell but idk.

To watch this in 2023 when bleached eyebrows are now a trend is WILD!!! Thank you for what you do!; Lash extensions too!! They literally change the way you look and see yourself. I know so many girls who hate the way they look without lashes (which is what they look like naturally) it’s a shame; When cosmetic surgery makes you uglier, you know that something&#39;s wrong with beauty standards.; Ooh I have laser hair removal so know I can say I did cosmetics surgery 😮 I have conflict issues, my mom had breast surgery, my sisters had nose jobs, and my aunts liposuction. So I am 100% but I don&#39;t like the pressure; I&#39;m not against cosmetic procedures at all, there are soooo many reasons for it and it comes in so many shapes and forms. One tiny thing can be life-changing for people and I love that! <br><br>But what I hate, is that it becomes a trend. People are aiming to look like the rich people who have got procedures, but we are all poor, so we don&#39;t have access to flawless, scarless, perfect cosmetic surgery. <br><br>Rich people change their face with every fashion season. They make it seem normal to change your entire face or body regularly to fit whatever societal beauty standard is cool at that time. <br><br>And of course what infuriates me the most, is that the beauty standard, more often than not, is skinny, big butt, boobs, white, (or lightskinned/blackfishing white people), small nose, big lips on a white woman etc. <br>It is the most vile thing to convince poc that they are not the standard of beauty. When in reality, people from every race are beautiful and beauty is diverse. Diversity makes people beautiful. <br><br>I think for white women who get big lips, big butts, big boobs, ribs removed, tan (Kardashian types) are truly jealous of black women and their features and bodies, and instead of raising them up for their beauty, they take it and use it on themselves, throwing it back in their faces. It&#39;s nasty. <br><br>Same for young people in Korea, the statistics there are INSANE. So many women have had invasive plastic surgery before 21. Because they&#39;ve been brainwashed into hating their Korean features. <br><br>Convincing the world that you aren&#39;t beautiful unless you&#39;re Eurocentric Kim Kardashian is the most disgusting, damaging thing.; This is important, well done!; I very rarely feel sympathy for rich people but saying a 9 year old needs a nose job is profoundly messed up on every level. What happened to loving your kids no matter what? I have a birth defect that effects my genitals and my parents refused to risk my life despite how many doctors said I needed cosmetic surgery because my life was worth more than the health risks of doing that to a that. Why didn&#39;t Khloe&#39;s parents love her enough to say to her what my parents said to me, that it would be my choice when I was older and could make an informed decision and understand the risks? She&#39;s her mom&#39;s daughter, not her mom&#39;s mannequin.; As a younger woman in society, this helps a lot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=37"">0:37</a> you’re just saying that cuz you don’t want more hate from the woke community be honest; Companies are really out here making a profit out of our insecurities...; Okay now I feel bad for getting my braces done; I&#39;m a 60 YO woman with severe OA in both knees, which results in weakness, stiffness, severe pain and progressive degeneration and disability.  Would love to get &quot;new&quot; knees to relieve pain and regain physical strength and be active again.  However, I can&#39;t afford such surgery. Cosmetic surgery is about ego. If you are physically healthy, be appreciative of that fact, and maybe work on your emotional health instead of taking risks of undergoing UNNECESSARY surgery.  Peace.; Poor and ugly people are just JEALOUS of people who get plastic surgery<br>Cause they&#39;re broke and wants to remain ugly .; This made me cry a little. I&#39;m someone who never wants to go to clinic for skins, surgeries, or even bracelet. When I was young I did get a lot of comments about my bunny 2 front teeth, from friends and my own mother. To me it&#39;s just a part of myself that makes me different, not good or bad, just that. I don&#39;t exactly love it or hate it, but other people do have more opinions about how I look more than myself. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong to want to look the way you want, I do make up and changed my hairstyles quite often because it&#39;s more of an expression of myself at the time. I feel like I could control my own narrative in a sense, which empowers me. <br>If surgery is something that empowers you, then it is a positive thing. If you use it to block the insecuries, I don&#39;t think it would help though. People will keep telling you that you&#39;re not enough, cause they&#39;re not too. It sucks that our society is shape to do that, so do love yourself first in the way that makes you feel most complete.; No Wonder KOKO K. has Migraine + OCD SMH 😾; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=1107"">18:27</a> exactly what i think when i see people with a load of plastic surgery; Hate how black people are said to have “big noses” when every race has their form of large noses. I see a black person with a big nose like 3/10 <br><br>Btw i think you look nice. I dint think western society would consider you a bad looking person; Are you kidding me I love your nose! It’s so pretty and really suits your face :); Yes you are right about Khloe but they are lying about a lot. Making the problems for other people bigger because it&#39;s an unrealistic standard. I suffer from bdd. I have been insecure all my life but now I am insecure about a lots of new things. Because the media pays a lot of attention to how you should look, so you focus on things that you didn&#39;t notice before. I hate my bdd. I feel like crap and looks shouldn&#39;t be so important. The we you are and the way you treat others, people, animals etc should be what defines you. I hate that I&#39;m doing this to myself. But in this world it isn&#39;t strange more and more people are getting bdd or eating disorders. Trends<br>trends zijn er zodat de industrie geld kan blijven verdienen<br>trends are there so the industry can keep making money.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=606"">10:06</a> the chances are 0<br>Because i will just fucking leave this toxic environment, and search for a new better one, at this point it’s not about my looks but my mental health.<br>it’s 2022 there is no excuse for ignorance and not knowing better, If you’re insecure or have low self-esteem or depressed… go to therapy. <br>not just because u feel good about it means it’s fixed, healing and confidence doesn’t happen in a one day with a scissor.; july 2022: all kardashains are undoing their BBL surgery and getting natural butts and all the women who got BBL looking at them probably wont have money to undone their BBLs<br><br>beauty trends come and go. I never thought big butts will suddenly fall like this, but they did.; Just to let everyone know the more surgeries like these you get the more chances of early age death and health problems and also purposely you become abnormal than normal.🤷🏽‍♀️; for a few years i’ve always wanted this one procedure and i was certain i was gonna get it, but recently i’ve only just realised that beauty standards will change and you’ve just gotta accept it. i’m only now 15; Just let me be ugly ok 😌; I always think of donda. It’s so ironic that he ended up marrying the most plastic woman and plastic family in our nations history. Donda and Joan rivers died due to plastic surgery. I will never forget that.; What gets me is that black people were ridiculed for having naturally big lips and butts and now everybody wants those features.; This is why I won’t get filler or surgery! As women we already pay for so many things: nails, hair color, hair extensions, lashes, pedicures, makeup, etc. And it’s never enough, in fact I feel like all of these things are necessary for me and I can’t go back to not having them. I just know that if I started getting filler it wouldn’t end there.; I am glad you talked about rhinoplasty and immigration. <br>Because, everybody talks about the caucasian beauty standard, but many caucasian HAVE naturally big noses, there is no single celebrity that didn&#39;t have a nose job. Colder countries have a higher evolutive rate of bigger noses, and more tropical ones have wider ones because it is the best manner to filter the air.  Yet, having a nose that is big or a roman looking one also leaves you instantly out of the canon &quot;beauty&quot; standard, no matter if you are white (not disregarding that non-white people suffer a lot of discrimination, and must feel the underrepresentation in a much worse manner). It&#39;s truly awful.  I think a lot of beauty standards correlated a lot to Germany&#39;s WWII &quot;Arian&quot; perception of beauty and their DEEPLY  antisemitic canon. Looking &quot;Jewish&quot; despite being white is still treated like the plague on beauty matters.; After watching this video my insecurities just flew away....thanx tho.; Do y’all realize that your features are from ancestors or your parents or even a family member, meaning changing it is like saying this feature isn’t good enough , imagine your kid changing his or her feature that you also have because they think it could have been better , how would you feel?and ik that I can’t make decisions for people but risking your features for filters that isn’t even real or an influencer who doesn’t even know you exist is wrong in so many level; Pretty cute using your coffee cup as a microphone. Love it. ^^ &lt;3; im only 14 and convinced my parents for male breast reduction surgery when I get old enough but it has really affected my health im anorexic and I think my chest is the main reson for that and ive always wanted to wear normal shirts without caring my shoulders over my chest :’); You’re what the world needs right now! Thank you so much for videos and content.; I really appreciate your bravery with the content you create. People truly have to learn how to love themselves as souls and spirits instead of putting so much emphasis on their outer appearance. We care too much about what other people think and our comparisons to others who likely don&#39;t even acknowledge our existence. It&#39;s really disappointing to witness  society hate themselves so much while loving others who hate themselves too. It&#39;s a vicious cycle that hopefully upcoming generations will break. Thanks for sharing ❤; There&#39;s never a complete satisfaction in the pursuit of pure fantasy 😒; I have been considering getting a rhinoplasty since I was 14. Watching this makes me think what if I hate my nose if it goes wrong. But I’ve been bullied and even my own family has said I should get one. Watching this breaks my heart because If it weren’t for the beauty standards I would be fine with my current nose.; The only thing i have a problem with its teeth whitening arguenent.<br>Your liver must be healthy; There should have been a trigger warning of the blood and needles I was gonna see 😭😭 I&#39;m not the only scaredy cat of needles am I?; As someone who had braces on my teeth i can truly understand why people get plastic surgery. I did not like my teeth before. I always felt uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t smile or laugh openly. I like my teeth now, i have no regrets and don&#39;t even miss or remember how they were before the braces. All i remember are the negative feelings. I don&#39;t like plastic surgery but i get it.; I love your nose!!!! Don’t change it!!! NEVER change it!; Drive-in Botox seems really unhygienic .. and insane.; I think you are extremely handsome and like the way you look just the way you are. Thanks for all the hard work you put into your videos!; Khylie had dramatic changes to her face and butt right? Are those people that sucked their lips into cups permanently stuck? They’re nuts; most girls these days including myself would rather be perfect or pretty enough than healthy and alive.. i think thats so so sad, but i know if i had the resources id do the same thing; BREAST IMPLANTS ILLNESS IS REAL. its concerning that not many people are aware about the health complications that come after having breasts implants for a long time. many of those who suffered even ended up having their implants removed and their health improved almost instantaneously. (do check out natalie’s outlet video she talked more about this and her whole experience abt getting her implants removed); I actually never comment on Youtube, because I just always view it on my TV (I replace watching Netflix/Hulu, etc with Youtube videos!) but anyway--- I have to say... I am IN LOVE with all of your content! I actually watched your &quot;Kardashian kult theory&quot; video first (shown as a recommendation) and then 7 hours later, I find myself watching you at 5am! Haha. Thank you for the hard work you do to show us your enlightenment! As above, so below. God bless.; I love this so much!! I remember being 11 wanting a boob job and I didn’t realize I was already beautiful until I was 27!! So glad I couldn’t afford a boob job bc I would have made a big mistake. We really are all beautiful and the world would be boring if everyone looked the same; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=695"">11:35</a>; This is so sad. I was in my 20s during 90s of last century and no one really cared about looks, there were almost no beauty standards or body goals. We had supermodels but they all looked so different and most of us were fully aware it&#39;s their luck to be born with &quot;beauty genes&quot; and it&#39;s actually their job. We didn&#39;t try to look like them because it was obviously impossible. People aged naturally and there were no &quot;perfect&quot; ideal body with thick butt and small waist, no full lips fashion or small nose.... I feel like it wasn&#39;t even close to today&#39;s obsession with physical image. You have one life, if you are healthy, just love what you have, you will have no chance to repeat it.; I feel like born and being raised in somewhere thats fits in capitalism state its so dangerous for your own image, for me, the state of california specially in LA its the most material and fake place in the world, i feel like being raised in thats places that capitalism its the center of their lives can be the most tragical experience for a children and teenagers who is finding their own space and her own conception about what their really are and what their really like, creating this misconceptions about what a should look like its sad; Allhamdulillah !!! Being Muslim it&#39;s haram n even if I want to have I ignore that temptation !!! No offense I&#39;m just stating myself n my opinion ....; Uhhhh.... Three? 🤣🤣🤣; That little kid at the end has it all figured out….we may look like burnt chicken nuggets but that’s better than looking like plastic dolls; &quot;You will never fit in the beauty standards&quot;.This just healed me 😪; I think beauty shouldn&#39;t be A VALUE. Intelligence is a value, honesty is a value, kindness is a value... Beauty standards are costantly changing and can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be considered a value. However, our society is based on money, popularity, beauty and sex, sooooo... We are far away from a solution and honestly it&#39;s easy to be bothered by beauty standards, especially on social media. <br>I don&#39;t like my nose, people have always made fun of my big glasses with thick lenses, during the pandemic I gained weight and this started to stress me out because in quarantine I consumed soooo much social media content and I watched a lot of workout videos and &quot;perfect&quot; bodies. <br>I&#39;m trying to stay healthy (physically but also mentally) and use my smartphone in a more conscious way. <br>Thank you for this video, it helped a lot! ❤; Please due not feel bad. I find your a very handsome young man.❤️❤️; Her LIPS?!!! Kylie’s whole face is different! What a nice deflection for simple people.; &quot;Go ahead and get it as long as you don&#39;t look like a botched mess.&quot;  The problem is,  it only takes <b>one mishap or unexpected bad reaction</b> and you will look like a botched mess!; Excellent content as always.; The media has done that to us. Well done for loving who you are; You are perfect n just as you are; as i was on my journey of loving myself and stopping myself everytime i try and compare my features to others, my aunt came up to me and stared at my nose and was like “you really need a nose job”  and she basically laughed right after she said that. til this day i have accepted everything in me except for my nose because of that.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=1207"">20:07</a> is my paralyses demon. What nightmares are made of.; WE NEEED A VID FROM YOU ABOUT AGEISMMMMM; man, id only get surgery if i ever get chest and hip surgery.... trans moments; This video was really interesting!; we&#39;re just being gaslighted into this for money.; Your too young to remember Kim Basinger, but she started the whole plumped lips trend.; Is there anything more beautiful really than someone who thinks for themselves and speaks such truth? You are perfect inside and out Ibrahim, please don&#39;t put yourself through any of those surgeries ever 🙏🏼💯💫; It’s okay to get plastic surgery but denying it when it’s so obvious is not it 🤡; You&#39;re so young but blessed with so much wisdom and common sense ❤️; We are not our acne, we are not our flaws, we are individuals with interesting personalities and lots to share and learn .; When I was 12, I was ashamed of my nose, my ex-best friend told it so ugly and huge that I need a rhinoplasty. Now I’m 16 and l realize that was soooo toxic, my nose is my nose, it’s perfect on my own; Nice; Nice; Love your real investment into your content your hard work really shows in your videos. Amazing 👏; Remainder: you are not ugly the society is; Idk why but plastic surgery just makes me feel nauseous. It&#39;s hard for me to understand wanting to do that to your body; Love yourselves and tell your daughters and sons to do the same . I said what I said. I hate plastic surgery and what is has done to society.  I&#39;m against it whole heartedly and I don&#39;t care what anyone has to say about me feeling that way...sue me I guess 🤷🏾‍♀️; Please put a warning because of facial disfigurement; love how u break all this down every girl needs to watch this; Always quality content. I&#39;ve been trying to break the mental programming the media has been pushing. I&#39;m creating my own personal standard of beauty putting mental and physical health at the forefront of what beautiful is and i want to spread this to the people in my life.; 😍😍😍; Nice one; Wow; Wow; Nice; If plastic surgery didn’t exist, there would be no beauty standards.; Very goood, well researched video!!; My parents both have small noses and I ended up with a large nose. Ever since I was a kid I&#39;ve wanted a nose job. I ended up falling in love and marrying a man with a large nose and when I told him he said &quot;isn&#39;t it messed up that you&#39;ve hated your nose since you were a child?&quot; And it didn&#39;t register to me how fucked up that is until we started talking about having children. I don&#39;t want to put that onto my kids.; We need more YouTubers like you! Great video, great commentary, and great influence. Thanks; I live in Brazil and sometimes I just get tired of how sexualized is the image of Brazilian woman, and the reason of that? Surgerys! We are the country with most surgerys in the whole world, and of course by that we&#39;re seen as the &#39;&#39;hot&#39;&#39; ones! It&#39;s just so many songs of here sexualizing us as well; surgerys as &#39;&#39;brazilian butt&#39;&#39; or others surgerys with brazil-name related, the sexualization and objectification of latin America women in general<br><br>bro this is tiring; I love that you use international sources! It’s so refreshing; Stupidity at its best! Why would you any harm to your body to look &#39;good?!!; I love this content!<br>I am 46. I had a rhinoplasty 4 months ago and am tremendously happy with the results. Funny, I’ve been considering it for over 20 years because of an injury that created a hump. My nose also got fatter during my pregnancy. Think it over for a looooooong time if you’re considering anything.; Yo I can remember that around that Kyle lip challenge I wanted big lips so badly and wanted to get my nose done. I don&#39;t remember what made me feel like that but I remember it being very important to me and like if I had it done I&#39;d be worth more or sth. Yet I don&#39;t mind my looks that much now...<br> I guess I was hyper conscious about my looks when I was a teen...; Well done!; Your channel is the BEST!

Looking &quot;Jewish&quot; despite being white is still treated like the plague on beauty matters.; After watching this video my insecurities just flew away....thanx tho.; Do y’all realize that your features are from ancestors or your parents or even a family member, meaning changing it is like saying this feature isn’t good enough , imagine your kid changing his or her feature that you also have because they think it could have been better , how would you feel?and ik that I can’t make decisions for people but risking your features for filters that isn’t even real or an influencer who doesn’t even know you exist is wrong in so many level; Pretty cute using your coffee cup as a microphone. Love it. ^^ &lt;3; im only 14 and convinced my parents for male breast reduction surgery when I get old enough but it has really affected my health im anorexic and I think my chest is the main reson for that and ive always wanted to wear normal shirts without caring my shoulders over my chest :’); You’re what the world needs right now! Thank you so much for videos and content.; I really appreciate your bravery with the content you create. People truly have to learn how to love themselves as souls and spirits instead of putting so much emphasis on their outer appearance. We care too much about what other people think and our comparisons to others who likely don&#39;t even acknowledge our existence. It&#39;s really disappointing to witness  society hate themselves so much while loving others who hate themselves too. It&#39;s a vicious cycle that hopefully upcoming generations will break. Thanks for sharing ❤; There&#39;s never a complete satisfaction in the pursuit of pure fantasy 😒; I have been considering getting a rhinoplasty since I was 14. Watching this makes me think what if I hate my nose if it goes wrong. But I’ve been bullied and even my own family has said I should get one. Watching this breaks my heart because If it weren’t for the beauty standards I would be fine with my current nose.; The only thing i have a problem with its teeth whitening arguenent.<br>Your liver must be healthy; There should have been a trigger warning of the blood and needles I was gonna see 😭😭 I&#39;m not the only scaredy cat of needles am I?; As someone who had braces on my teeth i can truly understand why people get plastic surgery. I did not like my teeth before. I always felt uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t smile or laugh openly. I like my teeth now, i have no regrets and don&#39;t even miss or remember how they were before the braces. All i remember are the negative feelings. I don&#39;t like plastic surgery but i get it.; I love your nose!!!! Don’t change it!!! NEVER change it!; Drive-in Botox seems really unhygienic .. and insane.; I think you are extremely handsome and like the way you look just the way you are. Thanks for all the hard work you put into your videos!; Khylie had dramatic changes to her face and butt right? Are those people that sucked their lips into cups permanently stuck? They’re nuts; most girls these days including myself would rather be perfect or pretty enough than healthy and alive.. i think thats so so sad, but i know if i had the resources id do the same thing; BREAST IMPLANTS ILLNESS IS REAL. its concerning that not many people are aware about the health complications that come after having breasts implants for a long time. many of those who suffered even ended up having their implants removed and their health improved almost instantaneously. (do check out natalie’s outlet video she talked more about this and her whole experience abt getting her implants removed); I actually never comment on Youtube, because I just always view it on my TV (I replace watching Netflix/Hulu, etc with Youtube videos!) but anyway--- I have to say... I am IN LOVE with all of your content! I actually watched your &quot;Kardashian kult theory&quot; video first (shown as a recommendation) and then 7 hours later, I find myself watching you at 5am! Haha. Thank you for the hard work you do to show us your enlightenment! As above, so below. God bless.; I love this so much!! I remember being 11 wanting a boob job and I didn’t realize I was already beautiful until I was 27!! So glad I couldn’t afford a boob job bc I would have made a big mistake. We really are all beautiful and the world would be boring if everyone looked the same; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=695"">11:35</a>; This is so sad. I was in my 20s during 90s of last century and no one really cared about looks, there were almost no beauty standards or body goals. We had supermodels but they all looked so different and most of us were fully aware it&#39;s their luck to be born with &quot;beauty genes&quot; and it&#39;s actually their job. We didn&#39;t try to look like them because it was obviously impossible. People aged naturally and there were no &quot;perfect&quot; ideal body with thick butt and small waist, no full lips fashion or small nose.... I feel like it wasn&#39;t even close to today&#39;s obsession with physical image. You have one life, if you are healthy, just love what you have, you will have no chance to repeat it.; I feel like born and being raised in somewhere thats fits in capitalism state its so dangerous for your own image, for me, the state of california specially in LA its the most material and fake place in the world, i feel like being raised in thats places that capitalism its the center of their lives can be the most tragical experience for a children and teenagers who is finding their own space and her own conception about what their really are and what their really like, creating this misconceptions about what a should look like its sad; Allhamdulillah !!! Being Muslim it&#39;s haram n even if I want to have I ignore that temptation !!! No offense I&#39;m just stating myself n my opinion ....; Uhhhh.... Three? 🤣🤣🤣; That little kid at the end has it all figured out….we may look like burnt chicken nuggets but that’s better than looking like plastic dolls; &quot;You will never fit in the beauty standards&quot;.This just healed me 😪; I think beauty shouldn&#39;t be A VALUE. Intelligence is a value, honesty is a value, kindness is a value... Beauty standards are costantly changing and can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) be considered a value. However, our society is based on money, popularity, beauty and sex, sooooo... We are far away from a solution and honestly it&#39;s easy to be bothered by beauty standards, especially on social media. <br>I don&#39;t like my nose, people have always made fun of my big glasses with thick lenses, during the pandemic I gained weight and this started to stress me out because in quarantine I consumed soooo much social media content and I watched a lot of workout videos and &quot;perfect&quot; bodies. <br>I&#39;m trying to stay healthy (physically but also mentally) and use my smartphone in a more conscious way. <br>Thank you for this video, it helped a lot! ❤; Please due not feel bad. I find your a very handsome young man.❤️❤️; Her LIPS?!!! Kylie’s whole face is different! What a nice deflection for simple people.; &quot;Go ahead and get it as long as you don&#39;t look like a botched mess.&quot;  The problem is,  it only takes <b>one mishap or unexpected bad reaction</b> and you will look like a botched mess!; Excellent content as always.; The media has done that to us. Well done for loving who you are; You are perfect n just as you are; as i was on my journey of loving myself and stopping myself everytime i try and compare my features to others, my aunt came up to me and stared at my nose and was like “you really need a nose job”  and she basically laughed right after she said that. til this day i have accepted everything in me except for my nose because of that.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26U2VC7wKo&amp;t=1207"">20:07</a> is my paralyses demon. What nightmares are made of.; WE NEEED A VID FROM YOU ABOUT AGEISMMMMM; man, id only get surgery if i ever get chest and hip surgery.... trans moments; This video was really interesting!; we&#39;re just being gaslighted into this for money.; Your too young to remember Kim Basinger, but she started the whole plumped lips trend.; Is there anything more beautiful really than someone who thinks for themselves and speaks such truth? You are perfect inside and out Ibrahim, please don&#39;t put yourself through any of those surgeries ever 🙏🏼💯💫; It’s okay to get plastic surgery but denying it when it’s so obvious is not it 🤡; You&#39;re so young but blessed with so much wisdom and common sense ❤️; We are not our acne, we are not our flaws, we are individuals with interesting personalities and lots to share and learn .; When I was 12, I was ashamed of my nose, my ex-best friend told it so ugly and huge that I need a rhinoplasty. Now I’m 16 and l realize that was soooo toxic, my nose is my nose, it’s perfect on my own; Nice; Nice; Love your real investment into your content your hard work really shows in your videos. Amazing 👏; Remainder: you are not ugly the society is; Idk why but plastic surgery just makes me feel nauseous. It&#39;s hard for me to understand wanting to do that to your body; Love yourselves and tell your daughters and sons to do the same . I said what I said. I hate plastic surgery and what is has done to society.  I&#39;m against it whole heartedly and I don&#39;t care what anyone has to say about me feeling that way...sue me I guess 🤷🏾‍♀️; Please put a warning because of facial disfigurement; love how u break all this down every girl needs to watch this; Always quality content. I&#39;ve been trying to break the mental programming the media has been pushing. I&#39;m creating my own personal standard of beauty putting mental and physical health at the forefront of what beautiful is and i want to spread this to the people in my life.; 😍😍😍; Nice one; Wow; Wow; Nice; If plastic surgery didn’t exist, there would be no beauty standards.; Very goood, well researched video!!; My parents both have small noses and I ended up with a large nose. Ever since I was a kid I&#39;ve wanted a nose job. I ended up falling in love and marrying a man with a large nose and when I told him he said &quot;isn&#39;t it messed up that you&#39;ve hated your nose since you were a child?&quot; And it didn&#39;t register to me how fucked up that is until we started talking about having children. I don&#39;t want to put that onto my kids.; We need more YouTubers like you! Great video, great commentary, and great influence. Thanks; I live in Brazil and sometimes I just get tired of how sexualized is the image of Brazilian woman, and the reason of that? Surgerys! We are the country with most surgerys in the whole world, and of course by that we&#39;re seen as the &#39;&#39;hot&#39;&#39; ones! It&#39;s just so many songs of here sexualizing us as well; surgerys as &#39;&#39;brazilian butt&#39;&#39; or others surgerys with brazil-name related, the sexualization and objectification of latin America women in general<br><br>bro this is tiring; I love that you use international sources! It’s so refreshing; Stupidity at its best! Why would you any harm to your body to look &#39;good?!!; I love this content!<br>I am 46. I had a rhinoplasty 4 months ago and am tremendously happy with the results. Funny, I’ve been considering it for over 20 years because of an injury that created a hump. My nose also got fatter during my pregnancy. Think it over for a looooooong time if you’re considering anything.; Yo I can remember that around that Kyle lip challenge I wanted big lips so badly and wanted to get my nose done. I don&#39;t remember what made me feel like that but I remember it being very important to me and like if I had it done I&#39;d be worth more or sth. Yet I don&#39;t mind my looks that much now...<br> I guess I was hyper conscious about my looks when I was a teen...; Well done!; Your channel is the BEST!
