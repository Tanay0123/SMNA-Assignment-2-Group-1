J-Beauty vs K-Beauty: a professional reveals the REAL differences between Japanese and Korean beauty,Odile Monod - The Monodist,2020-10-05T19:40:52Z,J-Beauty vs K-Beauty: What's the Difference? Have you ever wondered what's the real difference between J-Beauty and K-Beauty ...,ZGaz0BGiDIc,"I thought this was genuine comparison of specific products and instead you basically claimed J-beauty marketing bashed K-beauty and how they were wrong to do so. You said nothing good about J-beauty and that they were over-hyped which is not true recently. Hardly anyone in the West really talk about J-beauty these days as having real merit. In the US where I live, beauty stores like Ulta and Sephora literally have sections for K-beauty and sometimes accidentally include J-beauty products because they can&#39;t tell the difference. The only place you will see J-beauty is in a Japanese market/grocery or department stores with just the Shiseido counter. Go to TJ Maxx and for every 100 Korean products, you see maybe 5 Japanese. So I don&#39;t see why you feel the need to go on and on and on about defending K-beauty. Clearly you dislike J-beauty and their marketing, we get it.; I remember growing up and saw news of heavy metals found in Etude makeups 😅; Mmmm 🤔 llevo 8  años comprando k Beauty por que es más fácil conseguirlo pero gracias a este video comprare el japonés, tendré mi propia opinión.; J Beauty has been overall an underwhelming experience for me.  It can’t touch K Beauty….ESPECIALLY since discovering History of Whoo last week at our local H Mart! Wow! I’ve never gotten quite the sensorial experience even from other more expensive luxury western skincare brands as I have from History of Whoo.  At 56, I’m here for it!  I bought the Cheongidan set (balancer, essence, emulsion, face, and eye cream).  It makes my skin feel like velvet.  <br>I love K beauty in general and have been a convert to their toners/essences for 2 years now and I’ve enjoyed many brands.  History of Whoo though is in a class by itself.<br>Would love your specific History of Whoo recommendations for my 56yo menopausal skin?  Also: one of my sets came with a small vial of ginseng oil I think? When should I use it in my routine?<br>Love your channel!; congrats on a spectacular video. wow. You definitely have tons of knowledge that is presented amazingly in this video. Thanks!; AMAZING Video, in some many levels! <br>And this was the 6 video watched  in a role, absolutely in love with your Chanel and your huge care on your content… thanks a lot for so much! <br>Learning and thinking very different after your help!<br>Huge hug from Brazil ❤ dear Odile!; I understand what you were trying to communicate here and appreciate the unique but necessary angle you took here but still I wanted to know if all of it can be chalked up to marketing. Because more generally speaking, in my observation, this tried and tested, simple but mature and long term approach of Japan and the more fun / experimental , trendy approach of Korea seems to permeate in the culture in many regards in my own observation.<br><br>So would you really say that the differences are only as far as marketing, aesthetics or anything that isn&#39;t related to the actual product?<br>Not saying that one is objectively better than the other, but even if there are some differences in their target outcome, that could help in making an informed choice depending on what one wants from a product.<br><br>I get that it&#39;d vary depending on the company, their product line etc., but just more generally; wow! mindblowing! thank you! I was choosing where to go - South Korea or Japan for my first Asia visit. South Korea, here I come :); What about C-beauty? Chinese traditional medicine is very similar to Korean TM. As I reside in China, I used the opportunity to randomly explore their brands, and the products I&#39;m blown away by are super cheap, made by small brands. Like a lavender infused &quot;scar repair touch up&quot; cream. It is the only product ever to smooth my deep frown and forehead expression lines. They have their own  major hi-tech brands too, hope you can review them in future.; If you are a Korea based artist of course you will say that j beauty is overrated; I only recently found your content. Very well constructed, learned a lot.; After I started using History of Whoo, I couldn&#39;t use Cle de Peau anymore.   CDP just felt like toys.  Hanbang has been a real game changer for me and I&#39;ve been sharing this with friends.; Thank you Odile for this very interesting video! I have never connected the dots between the political context and this silly K vs J Beauty war. at the end, I have some absolute favorite product both from Japan and Korea (and France by the way) and It is working just fine for my skin :)<br>I would maybe add as a major difference between Japanese and Korean brands for a western customer like me : it can be very difficult to find English data for some Japanese product, which is usually not the case with Korean product.; Because I am really just now getting into skincare in general and I also lived in a rural town without internet for most of my life, I’ve stepped into K beauty and J beauty in its current state. What’s interesting is because I didn’t have a prior opinion or experience with either during the surge of K beauty popularity in the west, my preconceptions are almost opposite of what you’ve stated. Here are my impressions of the two since I have only just learned about them:<br>J beauty: established, dated, plain, marketed toward older women, sometimes cartoon characters are prominent with the theme of the packaging, way too many colorful words on the package that makes them seem less elegant, more like a tool. Ingredients work, but they don’t necessarily budge too much into innovation.<br>K beauty: marketed to create a sensorial experience and a feeling of opulence and indulgence. Ampoules, toners, serums, masks feel all luxurious, like bringing the spa to your bathroom. Many ingredients are tried and true, but there is a lot of innovation and technology that goes into the delivery of ingredients and the efficacy of new ingredients. Lots of glass packaging, lots of soothing aromas, feeling encouraged to put 3 layers of an essence on. All very “emerging research” marketing. I have a serum that delivers cica in dissolving capsules- very cool. I feel like it’s more accessible to the western market now. I trust a product more if I know it originated in Korea (based on preconceptions alone). <br>So I think with millennials and on the narrative has flipped.; I love k beauty; Very interesting!; The great awakening do not let beauty industry behind. So much lies and manipulation by colonialist mentality. Thanks Odile.❤; Highly informative video. I respect both skincare methods and products. I have some skincare products fr both countries. I agree with you when you mentioned Korean skincare invests in research and new ingredients. It&#39;s good in a way. But I get overwhelmed sometimes when there are numerous release of new products when I just want the best haha; Hi, Odile! I really appreciate this video of yours about the differences between J-Beauty &amp; K-Beauty, but I sense based on the video and your comments that you are pro K-Beauty or lean towards K-Beauty more. It cannot be called a comparative video if you prefer one over the other. I&#39;ve seen most of your videos too and they are almost all K-Beauty. To be fair, maybe you could do reviews of Japanese brands too.😊 I am Japanese and am knowledgeable about the rift between Japan and Korea, things that have happened decades and decades ago, and depending on whom you hear &quot;historical facts&quot; from, you will always get a different answer. Scandals are not the measure of how products should be dealt with. Let&#39;s just put it this way, Korean beauty has K-POP to thank for it&#39;s popularity. Globally, everyone has been sucked in on Korean food, Korean music, Korean dramas, etc..and this creates familiarity for the beauty consumer. Another thing, and I think this is the most important - for the longest time, Japan has never had English translations in their tubes, tubs, bottles, or whatever beauty product. Lately, they&#39;ve been starting to label them a bit, but the majority is still in japanese characters. K-beauty has been very diligent with their english translations on labels, boxes, etc., so for Westerners, the English translation is a godsend. Let&#39;s not try and meddle with history, about Japan controlling Korea in the past. You are neither Korean or Japanese, so please respect that. Your expertise is on beauty and not on East Asian history. Besides, whether Korea admits it or not, they have always raised their bar because of the standards that Japanese beauty has already established. I&#39;m sure it will not surprise you that professional makeup artists, hair stylists, etc. use a lot of J-Beauty on their clients. So, with that being said, i hope to see you review more Japanese products, not just stuff like SKII and the rest, but more products out there. It doesn&#39;t really take a professional to reveal differences. They are made in Asia. Period. And for that, it makes us Japanese very proud. I&#39;m proud of the Koreans too and what they have achieved after the IMF. Asia is here to stay and although we welcome the world to try our products, we would also appreciate it if people outside of Asia avoid biases, because in truth, Japan and Korea do help each other, even in beauty. Where do you think Korea got inspiration for their gel-like consistency sunscreens? Their gel-milky toners? I&#39;ll leave it at that.😊😊😊; If you check the history, Shiseido is probably the oldest cosmetic company in Asia and was born about 40 to 50 years before the first Korean cosmetic company of the same scale. That says it all. Besides, if you know the women in both countries, you will see that there is a huge difference in beauty philosophies. I would say J-beauty is much much more organic than K-beauty.; In my opinion, j-beauty is a little overpriced; Enlightening thank you.; Thank you for this video, for me I use a mix of US, european, Korean and japanese beauty. I find that for the same price range, K-beauty has a lot more options than J-Beauty, and some of them are definitely better than J-Beauty if I dig deep enough. The only thing I don&#39;t like about Korean is their hesitation to include alcohol in sunscreen, thus some Korean mineral sunscreen tend to be heavier and harder to apply evenly than Japanese counterpart, where there are some really light-weight sunscreen.; Korean skincare is better in summer and japanese in winter <br>But now i see japanese more like have watery products so both are good .<br>I am sticking with 5 or 3 steps 😅 but then this i can&#39;t 😅; Lol. kbeauty exports world 3rd while jbeauty only 5nd.; I absolutely love the blend of geopolitical influence upon the skincare industry. Your vids are so interesting. Odile. Thank you.; I live in Japan and have never found Japanese skincare that works for me. There are just so many issues with their skincare and skincare beliefs. I have acne prone skin and they suggest products to me with &quot;high moisturizing power&quot; (which would make me break out more), hardly any acids/actives and also EXTREMELY high alcohol or perfuming ingredients which irritate my skin even more. <br>They seem to think acne is just &quot;red spots&quot; and I am always recommended &quot;brightening&quot; products, when really most westerners have hormonal acne with deep painful cysts and need strong ingredients like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and adapalene (all of which you can only get through dermatologist prescription here).<br>Korean beauty just always has a much more advanced blend of ingredients for most of their stuff..Japanese products have outdated ingredients and feel more like something my grandma would use.; Interesting!  I never heard this distinction between J-Beauty and K-Beauty, but I have always preferred J-Beauty because K-Beauty puts fragrance in just about everything. In particular, J-Beauty sunscreens are usually fragrance free in my experience.; It seems to me that South Korea has eclipsed Japan in cars, appliances (large and small) and now, skincare, too!!; I‘m so glad I found your channel!! Thank you so much for sharing such valuable information, definitely subscribed!; You are more than a youtuber you are an investigator 😳😳; Great Video; OMG amazing info &amp; video!!! 💖; Japan and Korea are different, so naturally they will target different aspects of consumer needs. <br><br>More conservative and traditional marketing by more established japanese brands appeal to people 30 and up. Korean brands being newer, and largely popularized by K-Pop and K-drama, is marketed for foreign consumers for the &quot;K-pop&quot; look. That&#39;s it.; I love both Japanese and Korean Products  but i Prefer Japanese products, I have been using Shiseido  and Sk 2 and other japanese brands since  i was in my 20’s. Everytime i meet new people, the first thing they notice is my skin especially my face, great skin is in my genes but without the help of these products, i wont maintain my flawless, youthful and porcelain skin. The korean product im currently using is “ Im from” honey serum, i love it, now that im not getting younger, i prefer skin care products that will prevent fine lines and wrinkles so far until now, im wrinkle free 😄; OMG I love wasting my precious time in Odile&#39;s channel. ugh! Keep it going Odile!; Japanese skincare products are not even popular here in our place. When you go to mall, every products has hangul or made in korea lol. It just recently japanese skincare products are booming here<br><br>There products has even a less access such as products of SKII and IPSA. We need to order it from Hongkong or in its origin country Japan; Whatever you say I still go for J-Beauty products. I have trust issues now on K-Beauty products because of their sunscreen scandal; I&#39;m actually interested about the topic of J Beauty has this category of &quot;quasi-drug&quot;, where it&#39;s cosmetic, but has a different regulation<br>Does K-beauty and other asian country has that? Or any other part of the world?<br>And how does quasi drug differs with a normal cosmetics? Is it just another marketing term?<br>The product that I know is quasi drug is Melano CC serum from Rohto<br>But knowing you specialised in K-Beauty, I hope I found someone who as thorough as you, but in J-Beauty version:&quot;))<br>I like both K and J beauty product, but as consumer, I just buy something more accessible or more affordable between the two:)) and it differs from product to product, so yeah; 지적수준이 굉장히 높으시네요 구어체에서 쉽게 볼 수 없는 용어들...ㅎㅎ 저도 외국어와 문화공부좀 해야겠어요 응원합니다!; GREAT!; I&#39;m binging your videos cause they&#39;re so well researched and knowledgeable! Thanks Odile 💕; So what Korean face creams are packed in a cute jar? This is what took the entire Korean beauty industry into the world. Cute packaging was something different, new and refreshing, something that hadn&#39;t been seen and exactly the difference from ordinary, boring packaging was the reason why people chose to try Korean products back then. We all are childish in some way and I still love that Tonymoly packaging. Sometimes we pay so much money for a glass jar or the name of the brand, but only thing that matters is results you get from the product.; You are completely a liar or a know-it-all especially about the history at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGaz0BGiDIc&amp;t=589"">9:49</a>...; you have an old accent; 한국말도 할줄 아세요? 혹시 혼혈이신가요?; Thank you Odile! Really appreciate this thoughtfully explained post! I’ve loved many gorgeous products from both countries. These two countries have a very long complex history together &amp; it’s important to look at that imo  💕🌸!!!; Whenever I think of Jbeauty, glutathione comes to mind. It was a very popular whitening and brightening product that a lot of Jbeauty products have that became very popular here in Southeast Asia. And eventually, a lot of our own brands made their own glutathione products. But the idea that Jbeauty glutathione products are superior still stuck on people&#39;s minds.; More is more vs less is more. But both are good.; I&#39;ve lived in Hong Kong for a long time and have been using Japanese and Korean products for many years. I&#39;d say that overall, I prefer Japanese products. They never irritate my sensitive skin, I&#39;ve never had a problem with a Japanese product. With Korean products, though, it&#39;s a hit and miss. A lot are quite heavily perfumed and I dislike that, also they love to add an essential oil or 2 to their products, like lavender oil. Basically, with Korean products I&#39;ve had either some really good results or some terrible results that ended up in break outs or skin irritation. I absolutely love their artemisia products though, I really liked Missca Artemisia essence (the Missca first essence broke me out) and I loved Tony Moly Artemisia 2 layering cream. As for the Japanese products, I like Freeplus repair lotion and emulsion, Sana soy milk wrinkle lotion and emulsion and Maikohan UV gel, also Hada Labo premium products. I also love the Japanese film mascaras. It&#39;s a type of mascara that doesn&#39;t smudge the whole day but removes easily with water, you can easily pull it off your lashes.; 한국 화장품의 품질이 예전에 비해 좋아진 것은 맞다. 하지만 최근의 한국 화장품은 ewg 등급에만 지나치게 의존하는 현상이 있어 걱정스럽다. 화장품이란 ewg 등급이 전부가 아닌데, 소비자들이 맹목적으로 믿고 있어서 제조회사 연구원 화학자들이 이 현상에 대해 고충을 토로한다. 이로인해 오히려 화장품의 품질이 저하될  수 있다는 우려도 나온다. 왜냐하면 화장품 이라는것이 단지 화장품 안에 ewg 그린 등급에 해당되는것 성분만 넣었다고 해서 무조건 좋은 화장품인 것은 아니기 때문이다. <br>그리고 얼마전 자외선차단제의 경우 차단지수가 조작되어 거짓인 제품이 많아 문제가 되었다. 이 문제는 브랜드사 혼자만의 문제가 아니라 한국 화장품법, 임상시험센터, 제조회사, 판매업자 모두와 긴밀히 엮여 있어 쉽게 해결하기도 어렵고, 다시 조작될 확률이 높은 문제이다. 지금 원래라면 올해 여름을 겨냥해서 한창 자외선차단제 신제품이 쏟아질 시즌인데, 이 문제 때문에 올해는 자외선차단제가 거의 출시되지 않고 있다. <br>그리고 메이크업을 전문으로 하는 메이크업아티스트 같은 사람들은 여전히 색조화장품의 품질은 일본것이 좋다고 인정한다. 한국 화장품의 품질이 발전하는 동안에 다른 나라 역시 쉬지않고 화장품 품질이 계속 발전 했기 때문이다. 나는 한국인이고 한국화장품이 더 발전하기를 바라지만, 요즘 한국 화장품계가 좋지않은 모습을 보이고 있어서 염려스럽다.; Thank you for this! I have been writing a chapter on K-beauty for a book I&#39;m contributing to. And growing up in SEA like some other commenters here, I also grew up with a great deal of Japanese makeup and skincare, although at home it was all French skincare as my mother is a French-trained aesthetician. However, when Korean skincare started to be distributed in SEA, I slowly felt a great difference. The &#39;ear on the ground&#39; ethos of constantly pivoting and innovating was so refreshing. Especially since Japanese skincare for all the good things, were still hung up about increasingly outmoded ingredients such as widespread use of alcohol. Even now, I find myself avoiding a majority of Japanese lotions due to the consistently present alcohol content. I have grown to love things coming out of both industries and feel so enriched experiencing the popularity of both industries. More importantly, watching these industries now change the attitudes in Anglo-American beauty industries too. &quot;Whitening&quot; was always cast as culturally regressive, but suddenly every hyperpigmentation and melasma fighting ingredient, including the calls to abandon UV-based tanning altogether is deemed as the right thing to do.; J-Beauty Marketers are going to find a way to use the sunscreen scandal for their goals. Thanks to you we have balanced background knowledge.; 저도 한국에 사는 한국인이지만 2000년대 초반까지는 일본산 화장품을 주로 썼던 기억이 있어요 품질면에서 한국산보다 더 낫다는 인식이 있었거든요 하지만 지금은 굳이 한국산을 써야겠다고 의도한건 아니지만 스킨케어 전 제품 모두를 한국산으로만 쓰고있네요  굳이 일본산 제품을 써야할 이유를 모르겠어서요; I&#39;ve watched your latest video about K-beauty controversy. What do you think about the Myth 3 now? I&#39;m curious about the regulation around cosmetics in Japan. I&#39;ve heard the regulations are strict there.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGaz0BGiDIc&amp;t=366"">6:06</a> I really don’t like if a company marketed their products with some “magical” ingredients.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGaz0BGiDIc&amp;t=452"">7:32</a> I’ve tried some J-Beauty sheetmask before that have limited edition ingredients that are native from different prefecture. And.... this product seems more wacky than what they claimed K-beauty were 🙃. It’s more like a unique souvenir to bought home for your friends and family, not actual sheetmask that brings benefit to the skin. Sorry to say.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGaz0BGiDIc&amp;t=645"">10:45</a> I really like J-Cosmetics mascara 😂😂; Haha funny intro; Hi.... Odile... U’ve just got a new subscriber here. Thank u for this information, I’m going to use this information to promote my K-Beauty products on instagram, I’ll mention u on instagram 😊; Can you please make a video bout<br>&quot; Some Asians have double eyelids since birth.&quot; this topic please..?<br>Many Westerns think Asians don&#39;t have Double eyelid...; Incredible smart vídeo : that mix of geopolítics and beauty industry.; So interesting and good to know; thank you!; 와 진짜 속이 다 시원하네. 영상 만들어 주셔서 감사합니다. Nothing but truths said in this video.; This was so interesting! Every video of yours I learn something new. (:; That&#39;s traditional and typical what japanese always have done.; I love this video ! <br>This is such an interesting topic that only few people talk about it !!<br>I find it so unnecessary when I see posts or people comparing k/j - beauty , specially when you have amazing products from both sides.; I enjoy J-beauty &amp; K-beauty equally. I will NEVER buy any skincare products from China...never.; 😆but i love the cute packaging and im 40. Scouting for new makeup western brands dont suit my skin type never have. Also you have a real asmr voice lovely to listen to thankies; Very interesting video, thank you for your content.; 세상에 저런 무레한 짓을 할줄이야 역겨워라<br>애초에 저런비교가 무레한거 아닌가?; Thanks. Enjoyed this. I grew up in southeast asia. Japan was the forerunner in culture beauty and entertainment in the 80s and 90s in my region before it was gradually eclipsed in the 2000s by South Korea. The brands Shiseido Kose and Kanebo were regular fixtures in our luxury section in our malls. Then of course SKII came along. When Korean wave was just rising back in early to mid 2000s I was on a business trip to Korea and I asked my south Korean colleague about BB creams and what brand does she use. She replied I dont use local brands I only use Japanese! Surprise! That was 15 years ago. I can see KBeauty has indeed grown from strength to strength due to its innovative spirit and passion. Well done South Korea. Finally im also going into Korean skincare now 😁; Thank you for this video. (=w=)/<br>I use Hada Labo and MISSHA by years so there is an international friendship in my bathroom!<br>These are my two fav brands matching my 44yo sensitive skin. I am just east-european woman who loves asian skincare.; Is it true that KFDA had just heavily regulated the ingredients for their cosmetics since many times American FDA rejected kbeauty products?; loved it🥰🥰😊; That was very informative and unbiased content; we really appreciate your work Odile. Will you also please do ASMR? Lovely voice and phenomenal accent :); Loved it ❤; Another amazing video. Love the historical background intro, it really makes you understand the reasons behind these misconceptions. I can feel how much this topic was important to you from the analogy with the male politician :P !! Love the new look you have here too !! Keep going Odile &lt;3!; Hi Odile, I love your videos and content. Can you make a video on sunscreen under make up? Can you give some recommendations ? thank you in advance; Super informative as usual! Where I see this argument thrown a lot is in regards to sunscreens. Japanese sunscreens are viewed as more reliable than Korean ones. I am not aware if there are any differences for sunscreen regulations between the two.; thank you for this subject ! i really enjoy and always  wonder corean or japan beauty care is the best ! i think both  of them  xoxo; Korean and Italian subtitles have now been added. Thank you for your patience ^^<br><br>KR: 한국어 자막 추가되었어요!<br>ITA: Adesso sono disponibili anche i sottotitoli in italiano!"

Don't forget to like, subscribe, share & turn on post notifications 〰️ NO COPYRIGHT ...",A1D9n3lNcF4,"Wanted to talk about this since it’s an important issue.<br><br>FYI: On June 7th, one of the Korean members of X:IN, Chi.U, announced her departure from the group. X:IN now has 4 members and they’re currently looking for someone to fill the empty spot. What a mess; Girl wya; The addition of foreign members is for foreign appeal and tapping into those new markets. But at the same time they have to be gain domestic fans and appeal to the “ traditional “ Korean kpop and beauty standards. So it feels like the dangerous balance game where they can’t appeal to both.; Watch black swan roll up; Why do Asians wanna try and look white so much? like. As a cuacasian its pretty weird.; Indian can be white, brown, wheatish, black etc but lets be real for once and you can&#39;t deny aria did change her skin colour and if you still think she didn&#39;t you are just delusional amd think by that way you can make other think that majority indian doesn&#39;t have brown skin sorry to break it you but you are aria and aria is not.the entire india and even in her koream teen meet indjan kpop idol vid you can see the diff in her skin tone neck and then vs now and compare she literally have exact same shade as nova how? Skin bleaching lets not Deny the reality; That golden brown skin is absolutely <b>GORGEOUS...</b> Sad that this foolishness that lighter skin is &quot;better&quot; exists.; I hope you post again soon!; I think aria is more popular because there company is really promoting her as an indian and new k pop group unlike syria.<br>Just an unpopular opinion; I am proud of my brown skin; بدون فیلتر زیباتره ❤😊; It is possible that Aria’s company might have made her undergo skin whitening procedures, but tbh Indians have a really wide range when it comes to skin complexion. Pale w rosy flush, olive undertones, deep browns and even darker (and I must add that they are all lovely in their own right). Aria’s complexion really does not surprise because there are Indians who are naturally paler than her without any procedures. However, the main issue here is the obsession w pale, light skin and the abhorring disrespect shown towards artists/people who do not fit that ideal. I mean, look at Shriya’s beautiful skin that many from the western part of the world would absolutely die for. The more we open ourselves to different “flavours” of beauty, the more beautiful the world will begin to feel..; Not only Korea, Indians are very obsessed with fair skin; it makes sense why  cha eun wooo the guy from true beauty would go in a skin whitening ad true beauty rubbed those words in our face; It&#39;s nothing to be surprised if she has bleached her skin or not. It&#39;s quite normalised in the k-industry .; tf is wrong with eastern people??? the makeup artists are using tone up creams and foundation is too light because in korea you can&#39;t find deeper shades... she defenetly did not bleach her skin; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1D9n3lNcF4&amp;t=479"">7:59</a> hah the accent changed; Gigi looks mad light now too; And they do bleaching and glutathione intravenous; Glutathione lightens skin; First time im seeing a thumbnail where before and after both looks good; Sriya is very good in dancing currently im looking forward to both Xin and Blackswan but BS didn&#39;t announce any comeback yet sooo right now rooting for Real album; TBH! its true fair skin is appreciated.  This is nothing to do with Korea. K-pop is an international thing.  It&#39;s just doesn&#39;t run on audience of Korea.  So, blaming Korea for this is not correct as per me. This exists in most of the world and even in India.  A dusky actress in Bollywood is left behind even after having excellent acting abilities. There is a famous Indian actress whose career really just took 180 Degree turn and she got popular after taking skin lightening treatment and hormonal therapy.  <br>The reason why Shriya vs Aria controversy is coming is because they are from same country and same Race. So, this thing is different from black vs white actress.  TBh! both are talented. But Sriya is actually a more talented dancer.  She is a very well-versed in Yoga as well.  But tbh! career of an actress or a pop idol is not decided on talent alone.; hmm as a indian woman,, before puberty my face skin colour was tan but after i became adult my face colour changed and i become 1-2 shades lighter especially with skincare and when i use makeup it makes it more lighter idk why lol (ion even use foundation). it was natural and i feel south asians dont have one uniform colour throughout their bodies like my thighs are lighter but my arms are more tanned and ofcourse like some comments have mentioned it could also be because of change in environment, staying in more and less uv exposure. its not always cuz of skin treatments,, tho it is widely used in kpop industry. anyways comparing both shriya and aria is really dumb imo; I am an Indian , and I came from Jammu and kashmir and I have a proper fair skin, it means I’m not an Indian??? What an illogical concept😂; Adeola can you stay  fair forever after skin bleach?; She probably discovered sunscreen ☠️ (this is my canon event); To all my dear foreigners let me clear it that not every Indian is dark or brown we have varieties of races, skin colours, languages that&#39;s the reason why India 🇮🇳 is the most diverse country in the world 🌍❤️.; She looks very Indian to me all indian don&#39;t have the stereotypes of hooked nose, same tone of brown skin etc. We come in many shades and shapes.; Adeola ash we need you to do a another video pls🥺; I saw jihyo&#39;s skincare video. They literally wear a mask and then use makeup on it.; She changed her beautiful name<br>She changed her beautiful hair<br>She changed her beautiful brown skin <br>she did this under pressure because of so called k-pop standards; Hi 👋 I&#39;m from India and my skin is fair but not that white. I visited my relatives in 2016 who lives in London. I stayed their for like 3 months or something and literally my skin lightened about 2-3 shades. When I came back home my siblings asked me what I used. Idk y it happened but Maybe same thing happened to aria too. As y&#39;all know india is a very hot country so shifting to colder country might be making our skin tone lighter.; People who think that sriya isn&#39;t preety are really blind i mean just look at her features......she is perfect; i know this is very off topic, but is the girl in the ad sa-rang from king the land????; Kpop culture is really toxic culture spreading skin bleaching and plastic surgery; Does colorism affect men as well?<br>Do Sriya&#39;a fans harass Aria or her fans? <br>Who defends Sriya?<br>Thank you for the video!; Save your kids from kpop side-effects; It&#39;s like they want nothing to do with black😢; People are judge by there quality , kindness and talent not by look; Such a important issue in Korea <br>Who decided that the pale skin people are more beautiful than the darker or brown they are such a fool and dumb I see many Korean people saying to other country people that there face is very small u look beautiful ur eyes are big 🙄 those people who don&#39;t have this type of facial features it means that they are ugly 😟 not all Korean people are like this but many are 😕<br>Respect to those who don&#39;t have this type of mentality 👏; Hopefully it&#39;s just filters. Because it seems like all music shows put filters in their videos.; We Indians comes in many colours depending on were u come from and many diffrent people live in India.  Its like small countires with there own culture and traditions. There are white indians dark indians asian looking indians  its like melting pot. Its all genetics not bleach.; This is India nd Asia people here r obsessed with Fair skin people use bleaching products....it&#39;s well reported in many international news channels about Asian obsession with fair skin nd bleaching products.<br>Bleaching products market size is growing here as there is economic boom people don&#39;t want to be dark skinned.....people here usually think dark skin people work in field as Farmers nd fair skin people work in factory nd comfortable workplace.<br>This is nothing new for us South Asian.<br>And pls don&#39;t call urself Indian ur Voice itself tells that ur an African women.<br>Not hate to u guys but this is not new for us here even in our industry if ur not fair skin people will not appreciate the nd industry will not pick up invest on u this is truth nd fact...It might be concerning for u but not us we know Asian mentality even our industry does same nothing new.; Omg this is so basic and I don’t why our own indian people are not supporting aria India is a very diverse country with different culture, tradition, weathers states. Every state has different weathers and people living in different states having different skin tones, you can find darker to the lighest skin tone . I don’t know why people can’t digest the fact that Indians have different skintones.They have different face features along with different skin tones. Even some indians are more fairer than foreigners; Sis we need you now more than ever they been getting wreckless I think it’s time for another compilation of these delulus favs and CA; What are yall on about saying she has eurocentric features??? She looks definitely indian.; She didn&#39;t bleach her skin people.. her skin tone is same as before😂😂; Could be lighting too…; Black pink Lisa also blitch her skin..so this is normal..dont hate aria.. Don&#39;t spread  Negativity 🙏🙏🙏🙏aria doing well; 우리 둘 다 운동해야지 이런 얘기로 누굴 미워하지 말아야지 슈레야랑 아리아는 둘 다 각자의 자리에서 유명한데 이 사람들은 두 케이팝 아이돌과는 아무 관련도 없고 질투심이 많다고 묻는다. 인도인들은 어떻게 케이팝 아이돌이 될 수 있는지, 여러분 모두는 배우지 않고 두 케이팝 아이돌을 모두 지지하는 방법을 알고 있습니다.; She didnt do anything<br>Me too like that colour in my preteen period<br>But i become really white in my late teen days; There&#39;s another girl who came even before Shreya but she is in Z-pop and therefore not recognized as a kpop idol even tho Z-pop is just Kpop but with all different nationalities...The girl named is priyanka who is dark in skintone and obviously received massive hate for that; She has a natural beauty 😍; her features are so attracting she didnt need pale skin.; Blackswan walked so x:in could run; Colorism is a big problem in India too. India has much bigger issues to deal with, so tackling colorism takes a back seat. The beauty industry and the entertainment sector normalized colorism, and other cultural factors also played a role.; People need to know that there are fairest of the fair INDIANS too. And when i was in my teens , i was darker than what i am today. Thats because i wouldn&#39;t use sunscreen. No proper skincare, playing in the sun for long hours . Now my skin has got lighter . Im not fair but my skintone has become lighter from before. That doesn&#39;t mean ive bleached my skin. And there are many friends of mine who went through the same.; Good luck to Aria but Blackswan is the only group I am gonna support for the much needed revolution they brought to the industry and to the world in general ❤️<br><br>BlackSwan on top; First people come and say &quot;we like fair skin tones&quot; and then when actors, singers and idol works to lighten their skin to people&#39;s appeal, they get trolled.; she looks very indian indians can be fair and dark skinned and our shades change based on the seasons; I respect your opinion, but I don&#39;t agree.; People are getting plastic surgery and here people hating her just for skin bleaching <br>And. Having a beautiful face and pair skin its like requirement for being kpop idol <br>Please stop this; Skin blessing is not a sin or a crime!!! Aria was formerly tanned before, however, she has now lost her tan. And because she is a K-pop idol, she must conform to Korean beauty standards!! And what a weird topid to discuss lmao; People will judge no matter what; Skin bleaching for sure where Sri Lanka is natural skin color; The title lol.<br><br>She&#39;s in korea, no matter what, they will push her to bleach her skin cuz of toxic beauty standard. Not everyone is like Hwasa a truly strong girl that embrace her look and dont let any people&#39;s opinion to affect her; No one hating Sriya i was supporting Sriya since she came in k-pop and even now but Our typical indians just being honest and it&#39;s not her fault. No one fault is there to hate. Being an Indian I&#39;m supporting both but many Indians are so typical they should support both of them instead if comparing each others. Sriya and Aria both don&#39;t deserve hate by any reasons because being an idol it&#39;s not a long term carrier and it only can decides when you&#39;ll be succed or not.; Honestly speaking i knew even if some indians made it to the kpop industry, they&#39;d have to change themselves to fit the standard there so I&#39;m not really surprised. As an indian myself i honestly don&#39;t understand why an Indian would wanna be a celebrity in a different country when they can be a singer here as well , specially in east asia when out of all countries out there they take physical appearance seriously the most. Yes colorism exist in india as well but are we judged as much in real life as well where everyone need to look a certain way or they&#39;d be bullied? No. Most indians i know in real dont even care about how they look when they go out. Where that&#39;s not how it is in korea. Im not really hating on korea here. Its the sense of values and culture are exactly opposite there so i don&#39;t understand why some indian wanna live their dream there when they can do it in here as well? Idk. If shes happy with it then thats okay but i honestly don&#39;t understand their reasoning; I will tell u myself well i don&#39;t think so she used any bleaching products cause due to puberty your natural skin color comes  again,it happened to me lol too i didn&#39;t even use any exfoliating products and u can&#39;t compare her younger self to her right now self lol,u guys are weird i myself has paler skin tone and u should before know that indian has pale-dark skin in India and even Why this skin tone is big issue lol.We are living in 2023,i and i think most of our generation support all skin types.; fukc the kpop beauty standards! she&#39;s beautiful as a godness; She has Indian features, not Eurocentric. Indian features are diverse.; So much stereotypes surrounding Indians. Just because she is light doesn&#39;t mean she has bleached her skin, I have seen indians with much lighter skin naturally.<br><br>I am an Indian, you should see me in summer and in winter, I am almost 3 skintones darker in summer due to sun exposure, in winter with less sun exposure i look much lighter. Never used make up, never used bleach, never had a facial. I don&#39;t think she underwent skin bleaching. Since I have started wearing sunscreen and taking care of my skin, it has started looking like it looks in winter. Skintones can fluctuate dramatically for medium toned skin.; Without filter tho her tanned skin is really attractive she&#39;s neither dark nor white but she got a fair skin tone according to Indian standard that doesn&#39;t matter tho she&#39;ll look beautiful either way; Both of them are beautiful in their own way , no hate to both of them for some rude stans make fan wars by saying hate comments to eachother . Both the girls are working hard for their goals , let us all support them ❤ <br> Please don&#39;t hate on sriya as she is also beautiful and every colour have it&#39;s own beauty.<br>Also please don&#39;t hate on Aria as bleaching is common among kpop idols and she is not only the one who only got bleached for being a kpop idol. But still to fit the kpop beauty standards noone should be forced to bleach , if they love to they can because it&#39;s their personal matter , but don&#39;t think only fair is beautiful because if only white colour existed our earth wouldn&#39;t be this much beautiful so every colour has it&#39;s own beauty ❤ <br>It&#39;s the fans who are making hating comments not the idols , so please don&#39;t hate on both of them as they don&#39;t deserve it.😢; i think most idols get their skin lightened or do something to prevent tanning as much as possible. It was more obvious with Aria, but thats something that is sadly very normalized, so much so many stans don&#39;t even question it. As an indian, i don&#39;t even think her features are very eurocentric (it&#39;s common for indians to have big eyes with long lashes, high nose bridge, etc). and while indians can have fair skin naturally, it is undeniable that she has probably been pushed to change her skin tone seeing her predebut photos.; FAIR INDIANS EXISTS!; Hi could you talk about xg???? It&#39;s a Japanese group that lives appropriating and never spoke ☠️; Dude she was tanned as she was from Southern side now when she was shifted to north west side her tanning went off she was naturally beautiful .......; I don&#39;t know if Aria did something but it&#39;s sad that colorism still going strong and it&#39;s pressuring people to whiten their skin. The comments that made about Syria are so mean what are those people problem is.; No she hasn&#39;t got bleached fair Indians exsits .......... I got 2-3 shades lighter just by using sunscreen and more shade lighter when I was in lockdown 💀 so ........ Idk why these allegations; 😛; Girl just so you know you&#39;re on twitter and they called you racist bc of this video; Please, Please pretty please post again, Adeola. I love your videos even when the truth hurts me a little😂; India is a diverse country.. not every indian people are dark skinned.. mostly every state people looks different.. and aria is from kerela and most of malayalees are fair skinned, normal ( not fair nor dark) or brown.. it depends...<br>Anyways i am a fan of both aria and sriya.. they both r talented in thier own way.. im both lumina and ready.. please stop comparing them...; But not all Indians are black in vally places peoples are very fair they look like forgeners; It&#39;s definitely true that India doesn&#39;t have a FIXED COMPLEXION because it&#39;s rich in diversity. Important thing to note here is even Korean idols sometimes have to go through skin fairness treatments. Most of the South and South East Asians have a darker complexion compared to East Asians. There were rumors about Lisa as well that she has undergone some kind of fairness treatment (if you compare her trainee pictures). All I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s pretty common and there&#39;s nothing to be surprised or hate on someone because of that. I&#39;m not fan of either groups but I definitely do wish Goodluck to them both; It’s pretty weird that it seems like that’s the only thing K-pop Stan’s care about as a kpop stan myself there where different K-pop idols from different countries and different races and nobody ever paid them any mind but just bashed half of  them like Fotu for example it seems like it satisfies them for some odd reason when they find somebody that suits their standards and I have heard absolutely nobody talk about her talent at all why does nobody pay attention to that instead of Korean beauty  standards then talent; It&#39;s her skin and her job .. people should be allowed to do things for themselves without being nitpicks and judged; Aria is South Indian Fair skinned girl<br>And Sriya is north Indian light dark skinned girl.<br>Korean agencies wants Fair skinned contestants It&#39;s very Racist.; it&#39;s just not Aria i have seen many korean idol changing there color from fair to pale like white milk....🍼🥛. Tbh i don&#39;t care; She is so popular for she was a child actor back in india; Aria had gone viral because she fits the beauty standards more than sriya. Sriya has a more indian/south asian face while aria has more northeast asian face structure, like people from tukistan.; I am an Indian with very pale skin. in India you&#39;ll find brown, dark or black , yellowish white and pale skin people it&#39;s not hard to find different skin tone in India and as I can see aria I don&#39;t know if she really bleached her skin or is this because of Korean climate or something like that; Korea don&#39;t know which country won most miss world title 😂 and who is Aishwarya Rai 😂; But honestly her hands are much darker than her face; don&#39;t you know indian girls are middle of black and white🤣🤣; Majority of indian live in rural areas who don&#39;t care about movies drama international shows etc only 5 percent elite urban folk are interested in stupid things; She wasn&#39;t dark skinned to begin with. The thing is our skin color changes according to climate. She might have bleached her skin to fit in. Maybe.; Yk i was also a brown person......but after working in AC rooms for more than 8 to 9 hr.s I felt change in my skin tone......idk if it&#39;s because of less exposure to sun or effect of AC ...... but our skintone can change from my perspective.....there&#39;s no issue"
Dark Skin Representation in The Malaysian Beauty Industry + My Top 3 Fav Makeup Brands,Daveena Kaur,2018-09-19T02:05:09Z,Video Description: This video talks about the lack of dark skin representation in the local Malaysian beauty industry and the issues ...,Z3WQu8PHSOs,Aren&#39;t most Malaysians (aside from possibly the Chinese Malaysians) tan or even darker? Sorry if that was an ignorant question; taris siss....semongkooo; Nice sharing 👍👍; If u watch minna bolongi on tv3 4pm. The heroin is like ir twin😆; Would love to see more videos from you! I&#39;m dark in Malaysia and it&#39;s a strugggglleee to find my shade in drugstore brands; This is a really informative video! Thanks for sharing with us! I’m sure you’re an amazing person in real life; i love it. slaying bby 🔥😍💯
How K-POP Destroys Your Body Image: A Video Essay,chaebin n out,2022-06-26T02:00:18Z,"two months of researching, scripting, and editing...and a whole two month hiatus to go along with it. but here's what i can show as ...",A3TSSjihhQ0,"it&#39;s finally out.  now i&#39;m finally going to go grab a seltzer and maybe even some sour patch kids.<br><br>this video would have been uploaded 6 HOURS earlier if youtube hadn&#39;t decided to take that long to determine its copyrights.  smh.  but really, hope you all enjoy!  this is where i&#39;ve been for the past 2 months, nice to see you all again!; If you wanna know how South Koreans would look like without those plastic surgery and skin bleaching just look at North Koreans.; That&#39;s why I love my J pop, my girls looking normal and human nothing like a doll, potato nose, round face some with crooked teeth... And the music is better, they value talent, not appearance ( Sorry k poppers, J Pop is years ahed ); Dieting is important for beauty. But dieting must consist of nutrition plus calorie deficits to lose weight. The fact there isn&#39;t much intelligence about this can be rectified. I abhor plastic surgery. Nobody should get it. It rarely helps.; Very good of you to end with positivity so viewers leave with positivity in mind 👍; The boys look absolutely homosexual. Something&#39;s in the water over there.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=726"">12:06</a> I honestly don’t understand why people won’t just put monolid tape into their daily makeup routines instead of getting a whole surgery for it- 😭✋; This is an older video, maybe this comment will be lost... But thinspo was already around in the MySpace era, worse even since everything was completely unregulated and there was no body positivity movement to counter this way of thinking.<br><br>Edit: in general, the kpop beauty standards are the same as those in the West in the 90s and 2000&#39;s, except we all wanted to be tan. The other standards and ways of talking about them is the same.; When she read out those beauty standards i laughed, like why the hell does someone need to have all those characteristics? Even the modelling industry is more diverse than the Kpop music industry and Kpop idols are singers and dancers first and foremost; how i feel after feeling prettier after kpop bc im a dupe of chaeyoung from twice; All kpop stans should see this vid at least once, thanks for the work you put into it, I specifically really needed to hear the conclusion, I wish more people felt that way... so really thank you so much :&#39;); I’m glad I found this video. I didn’t think I had an unhealthy relationship with food until I started going to therapy. My therapist and I are starting to deduce the reasoning behind it. One of it being more personal reasons, but the other being the influence of kpop on my life. I love kpop. I got into it when I was around 12 years old and it was extremely impressionable on me. I remember I was obsessed with wanting to look like AOA’s Choa and decided I needed to watch my weight. Which led to me visiting the doctors to check on my vitals and being forced to reach a certain amount of calories each day. Which is also another problem, but the body image issues the kpop industry could instill in young people is scary.; I totally agree. Also the fact that beauty standards change all the time. So why put our bodies and appearances through so much hardship just to look like someone else. I think unique beauty should be more celebrated and encouraged.; The control K-Pop companies have over performers is abusive, if not downright criminal.  To tell a teenager under the age of 18 to get plastic surgery so they can debut is morally reprehensible.  And sadly, the compliance of these naive and desperate performers only perpetuates this toxicity. I&#39;m curious to know if there is an  actors and singers union in South Korea.  if not there needs to be.; Cha eunwoo fits it without plastic surgery; This is, after watching a lot of Videos on Youtube, the most thoughtful and meaningful and well thought-out video, I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Thank you for adding value to this platform and for researching the topic so thoroughly! :); <b>TW: Talk about E.D.s + mention of family issues/loneliness</b><br><br>This video helped me realize why I have been so hard on myself and not on others; because I was comparing myself to people, and not comparing those who I saw. I can appreciate the beauty of each person of everyone but me because I&#39;m not taking the time to appreciate them for their uniqueness.<br><br> I was lucky to have found K-POP vent accounts at time I had been so in deep with the toxic starvation culture and my relapse of anorexia (at that time, I had already relapsed in binge-eating disorder before when this anorexia relapse came, so it was my 4th time experiencing an E.D.), because seeing people just as down as me, just as toxically demeaning to their own bodies was when I was able to truly reflect on my views of my body. I also found solace in the community at the time, and I interacted with sweet people, creating amazing connections I won&#39;t ever take for granted despite their end a long time ago, considering they were the first time in my life I felt appreciated, and like I belonged. <br><br>I am still making a progress that is not the fastest because I have once again relapsed in B.E.D., but I&#39;m much more self aware now, and I am working on improving my eating habits. Although I do have no one to talk to in real life and nobody online really anymore because of my avoidance of many of them, I am glad that I had people back then to show me that trying to go on insane diets won&#39;t make me anything other than miserable.; its a sad reality that a lot of these idols and fans perpetuate these toxic standards. It also feels so hollow to me when an idol campaigns about self love and acceptance when they do everything in their power to change and alter themselves to fit into those toxic standards.; Yuna, jk, rose; How body dysmorphia and refusing to take ownership of your problems and seek therapy ruins your body image*. Once people learn to stop blaming all of their problems on others, they&#39;ll start making progress. But yall dont wanna hear that because it&#39;s easier to point a finger and cry into a bowl of ice cream than it is to actually work on yourself.; That&#39;s why I love Mamamoo. They are of different facial structures, skin color (especially Hwasa), they can sing any genre of music literally any genre, all of them can rap, all of them dance very well and most importantly their fandom, moomoos, are really mature people. they don&#39;t fight or spread hate like other stans.; 12 hours? That&#39;s shorter than like skipping breakfast and not eating till lunch.. that&#39;s normal; I honestly think, that idols deserve all of that recognition they get, plus more. It&#39;s an appreciation for their hard work and sacrifices. Yet people shouldn&#39;t follow in their footsteps unless they are determined like them. The industry itself isn&#39;t nice, but then Hollywood isn&#39;t nice either.; Men visual started with kim jaejoong you can see many idols talking about it; okay so im jut so tired of being the second best i was sad so decided to watch this viedeo okay so there is this girl who is a girl what boy sees pretty as and im her frend and all the girls think im pretty we r sooo much into thins cant belive we are still into friendship as everyone compares us but the sad fact is that all the boys asks her that do you even know how many boys haave crush on u while all i get is ehh shes fine but why the seconbest when i can get the first its so hurtful it feels like im never just enough that girl is 36kgs and im 37 kg I&#39;m trying soooo hard to lose wait i just wanna be happy it just made me so quite and differ I&#39;m so tired i cant deal w thisbut ppl are still like  oh ur fine; Beauty shouldn’t be judged by appearance, but more by personality. (Personal opinion); I remember the interview where Soyeon from (G)-idle called herself ugly, and it keeps reminding of how toxic the kpop industry is to even convince such a pretty and beautiful girl like her that she is ugly.; Intro song CLC sky high ❤❤; These idols all look very very similar.  because they get the same surgeries, same filters.  Thank God They have different hair.  Imagine what it would be like if they all had the same hairstyle!; I think these idols and also the kardashians etc.  are driving the cosmetics and plastic surgery industry.  That a very big amount of money; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=1370"">22:50</a> omg THIS i see so many videos like this talking abt insecurities and each time i see one i just get so much more insecure; This is why people shouldn’t pay attention to music and the media. The whole industry itself is flawed, fake, and hypocritical. Move all the attention away from music and media and towards spiritual growth. And find a partner that does the same. Otherwise they will push their fake distorted unnatural ideals on you and you’ll be depressed and anxious for life.; wow, thank you; Hmm the first &#39;test&#39; was badly done the photos side by side were completely different poses and a couple obscured partially their face 🙃🙃🙃  or was that the point?; I think i got the dose of being near to death due to these k-pop products and now the only thing i do is listen to their music without obsessing or comparing myself to these; Well done, this is a great video essay and should be shared amongst the kpop fans. 🎉; I found white people tend to not have anything on their skin, like no moles!!! 😂; I have never been attracted to Korean men, too mean!; Fans never want to take responsibility for the part they play in this whole thing.; i used to have a plump body and when got into kpop, i started to be conscious as i look huge in photos. 6 years passed, i still couldn&#39;t get back to that shape. i am almost bones now 😭; I am 28 now and I remember when I was 14 seeing Gee for the first time and Genie from SNSD and thinking that Yoona was the most average! I promise... I had no idea then that she was the visual... I just felt like &quot;Oh yeah she is the most average one&quot; so beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. I personally always thought Yuri was the prettiest one! And then was confused seeing them all say to Yoona in a show where they all took care of a baby &quot;you are the pretty one... pretty like aunty yoona&quot; etc and I was like... Wait what? I don&#39;t get it? She is so normal looking? That&#39;s mean I know... but it&#39;s how I thought at 14 years old!?! hahaha Of course she is absolutely gorgeous, but for me personally... She wasn&#39;t the one my eyes were drawn to! I do think she is absolutely beautiful now of course, especially in her commercials for skin care... I miss the SNSD days! xx (Be aware, I&#39;m am actually Australian and white so maybe Yuri fits Australian beauty standards more? Not sure! But I showed all of my Aussie friends when we were 14  and some others liked Sunny and some liked Sooyoung but no one chose Yuri!); Korea doesnt accept puberty. they want these girls to look like little girls. and they probably don&#39;t have regular periods because they are starving.; I had an ed not because of k pop but because of magazines; Ok, this is silly, but when you&#39;re looking at full-body pictures of idols where their knees are out, look at their knees. Most of the time, they are basically edited out. I find this so exaggerated that I&#39;m skeptical of the rest of the photo, so I don&#39;t compare myself to them anymore. <br>It&#39;s also just so fun to notice that they have no knees. I always laugh my butt off.; 5.6 is not 170 cm. It is 5 point 7 feet , as in five foot and three quarters of a foot. <br>but height is measured in foot and inches.5 foot and 6 inches, 5.6 in height is 167.64cm approximately . 170 cm is 5.69, so basically 5 foot and 7 inches, 5.7. <br>Height can’t be converted from metric to imperial with the standard foot to cm converter, it needs a height foot and inches converter and always differs a bit from just foot to cm. <br>I only learned this after moving to the states because it’s so un intuitive.<br>So I’d be curious if idols need to be 167 cm tall or 170 cm tall.; I live and work in Korea with one thing I want to say; while I am not against plastic surgery when I hear &quot;it&#39;s your choice&quot; part of me wants to say-- but it also isn&#39;t. For context, I work in a middle school where often times plastic surgery is a gift for graduation, good grades, etc. It&#39;s also really common in high school for this. The youngest students are 13, and while yes it is their choice to want to get work done this choice isn&#39;t often because of Korea&#39;s built in system of profit. Plastic surgery companies waiting outside schools or on the street handing out items, the constantly pressure of media as SNS promotes getting work done to prevent aging, the beauty standard that tell them they won&#39;t get a good job if they aren&#39;t pretty, and overall weight of the topic. While on one end, the normalization and hyper intensity I think of getting work done with &#39;lunch break nose jobs&#39; and eyelid gifts make it so majority of Korean and non-Korean people see work as their choice but a choice of out necessity to get as soon as possible. There is no idea anymore of waiting until your brain fully develops or understanding if its truly something you want or are only doing it because the beauty standard is making you which many of these plastic surgeons prey on people like this. Overall this is what makes plastic surgery such a complex topic specific here in Korea and everywhere else as it&#39;s growing to be a normal thing, more than just on if the person is happy or not with it [which has other complex issues as plastic surgery often can&#39;t fix the root of the emotional problem people who are getting lots of work done face and in a job where sometimes its not a choice but a pressure].; Eunchae said le serrafim members share 1 dish between the 5 of them and have leftovers....; Hands down, the transitions are so good. 👏👏👏 love the video :); I realized that kpop, especially its fakeness and toxicity and the fandoms are not good for me and my mental health. <br><br>I feel so much better since i took a step back and distanced myself from it.<br>I only listen to the music now but dont stan any groups anymore. <br>They seem so open and funny at first but in reality they all lie and everything is scripted. Acting as if theyre all single and acting as if they love their fans so much etc… <br>Content is most of the time scripted and there is almost no live singing anymore. <br>Really, its going down with kpop. Appearances and visuals is number 1 priority now, all the idols are almost looking the same. They get the same surgeries, the same nose; the same double eyelids; the same faceshape and they all have the same bodytype (extremly skinny). No one wants to stand out, or theyre not allowed to stand out. Its as if theyre trained to be robots. <br>And the fandoms are so toxic i dont even have words for it. Kpop changed so much. It became a mass production, more and faster and more fake. It became unauthentic. And what also annoys me that kpop became a 24/7 advertisment show. Ive been here for singer, rapper and dancer not for models. Ofc idols always did advertising jobs but the amount nowadays is crazy. Every 2nd post is an advertisement. Its annoying and sad what happened to kpop; I saw kpop stars in real life they look unhealthy.; When you ask who is beautiful, for real, I cannot choose, they are all beautiful; I mean k beauty is a sham 90% plastic surgery; i would gladly eat only that if i made that money lol; TLDR: Beautiful is everyone, but not everyone sees beautiful as everyone. In the case of these idols, their ability to keep their own careers is based on how well they fit the beauty standard. Although idols are the most egregious case, based on my own experience, this is every field if you are a women. Beautiful is everyone, but if you don’t fit the beauty standard you will be the denied a job, and subsequently, your life. Sadly, even if it’s unhealthy, I know that I will at least eventually have to assimilate. I’ll have to take on dangerous dieting methods because it’s either dying to that, or dying because I couldn’t support myself. at least one of these is not guaranteed. unless of course, one of you people in this comment section can tell me otherwise. I’m open to hearing you.<br><br>I agree with what is said here. This is how it should be and by you making this video, hopefully that would be the case. i’m a senior in college, and I’m trying to get into a stem field as a woman. in one of my classes, I think I might’ve been confronted with sexism. And it’s not overt, and I don’t think it’s REALLY sexism. I don’t think he’s doing it for sexism. But the same sort of tactics I know will be used on me in the industry, and that will be sexism when that happens. So even though I don’t believe the intent was to discriminate against me, I was still confronted by the fact that even though this is how it should be it’s not.<br><br>Every single time I try to ask a question about homework or clarification about subject within one of my stem classes, I am told by the teacher that I am idi!ot for asking and then he would’ve refused to answer the question. But when my peers ask similar questions, he goes over and helps them. I am one out of two girls in whole class and major. <br><br>I’m trying to avoid examples cause I might lose you, it’s tech stuff. But to at least still try. Feel free to skip this paragraph if you can’t keep up with it. I understand. <br>In Java, which is the class I’m referring to here, in order to allow for a text input you need to import a module called scanner. You can think of it as getting wood to build a house. I need to get the would that would help build the mailbox, to allow people to put in letters. Those letters are input. Scanner is used to make the mailbox for the house. this mailbox though, must be built in a certain way or else it will collapse when holding letters. that was the part I need help with. to jump out the metaphor. I need to import it, which is putting a line of code before the start of the program. I also must create an instance of that package. Which creates one mailbox. You can have multiple mailboxes, but this creates one. When I did this, my program crashed. And I couldn’t figure out why it was. So I asked the teacher for help. He told me he wasn’t going to help because having any difficulty with this. He told me that he taught this enough times to where I shouldn’t be having any difficulty with it. So turns out it was a spelling error. So luckily this was not a problem where I couldn’t see myself, but another student had an issue not a scanner but with another spelling thing and he was willing to help that student. He even went over to look over his shoulder to check over his code. he would never do that for me. he’s made it clear that he sees me as a class id!0t. <br>If I lost you on that last paragraph I’m sorry I am not a teacher for a reason.<br><br>So I was treated differently in the class, but it wasn’t because of sexism. There are two women in the class including myself. If this was an issue where it was about sexism, it would’ve happened to the other woman in the class as well. It did not. He did this last year although not with me. There was a guy who sat behind me who is no longer majoring in computer science. He would often be made fun of by the teacher in class. he told him he wasn’t smart enough to get in the industry. So, although it is an assumption that I don’t know this for sure, I speculate there is a reason for why he dropped the major. after he dropped the major, this is when I started to get treated the same way. so based off that it’s not beast off of my gender, it’s the fact that he wants a class !d!ot. I don’t know why he selected me, but nonetheless I was selected. My regret is not calling this out when it wasn’t me. But I’m already really far off topic.<br><br><br><br>So what does this have to do with this video? If this case was not about sexism, why am I still citing it? Even though it’s not about sexism, I know that this will eventually will be. I know from at least one woman I know who is in the industry right now, it will be about sexism even at right now it’s not. it’s all fun and games when it’s not you on the table but when you’re actually confronted with it even in this more distant way that I did, what do you do? videos like this one it’s just like don’t listen to them, stand up for yourself. But I know if I actually do that, I’ll be fired, the same way I can’t speak up right now because I know that if I say anything the teacher will retaliate. this is not the first time a teacher is hostile towards students, it may be the first time in the college that it was particularly one student, but hostile towards students is not a new thing when it comes to this college. My constitution class, a class I’m required to take to graduate, he said that nobody is getting above a C even if there are no errors. if you get a 100% on the test, that will be graded as a C. he had his reasons, he told it was the combat grade inflation. this class in my college is infamous for being the worst class anyone will ever take at the college. And I didn’t even take the full class. I was there for three class days before I decided I would take my chances with the online class. I know, for not reporting this case, but for reporting anything on the campus of that puts you in jeopardy. This one made headlines so maybe you’ll figure out which college I’m going to. But there is a person who whistle on someone who waits a bunch of female students at my college. So what the school mandated her to do is to always sit by him in the classes she shared with him. They forced her to do this. she was lucky in the case that it made headlines, other cases that happen at this college are very much under reported. <br><br>Confronted with this, I decided not to step up. After all, the Internet is a vast place so I’m sure I can find someone who can help me with any problem I might have. This is resulted in me having to learn the material through online sources rather than through the class. This frustrates me because I’m the only student who’s doing it. No other student feels like they are threatened when asking questions. my answer to this question is to listen. If he wants me to stop asking questions, I stop asking questions.<br><br>Finally, this is what I’m trying to get at and why this actually relates to the video. I know I shouldn’t be judged on how I look, but I will be. The sad answer that I have come to is that I have to assimilate. if my weight becomes an issue, I will take on that dating method not because it’s healthy but because to not do so risk my job and my livelihood. I don’t know how far I will take this and I hope I don’t have to take it far. I hope that I don’t half to be put on such a severe diet, but it’s a possibility. I am a woman, and my worth is based on my looks. The same way it is right here all the way more noticeably.<br><br>But I don’t want to assimilate. After all, I am being dishonest with who I actually am when I try to fit a box. but right now I don’t see any actual solution. The ones that are typically suggested is in this video. Beautiful should be everyone, but everyone doesn’t see beautiful as beautiful. They will treat me differently based on whether I can fit the beauty standard of what ever industry I’m going in. Yes, I could work at a gas station but even there this beauty standards are applied. they might be the most loose, but they’re still there. as someone who worked at the gas station employee. do you know another hair color that I really would like to have? Pink. But, I was unsure how I was gonna rock it so I got a wig first. I got treated so differently not because they could tell it’s a wig. They thought I got my hair done and I was told that. So they did believe it was my hair dyed, but I was treated so much worse just for having that on. Even if they could tell it was a wig, isn’t everyone beautiful? I did expressed at least a small part of myself, my favorite color is pink. also, as everyone is stated, minimum wage is not minimum to live. I must get a job that will actually be able to support myself or I will die because I didn’t have enough money to pay rent. I already have college debt, so I really really hope I get in the industry.; These are rookie numbers they need to look at high school wrestling in the 90s.  &quot;Put on 10 trash bags and go run 3 miles&quot;  fuck yea!; Did you seriously say in the beginning that k pop introduced you to hip hop. As if k pop itself wasn’t modeled after hip hop???; this is such an amazing video; Celebrity worship is a mental disorder; Thank you so much ❤ I appreciate your work 💟; hear me out.. if ur audience gets triggered by all those things u keep warning them about.. its not ur problem.. dont. make. people. soft.; how can kpop destroy your confidence lmao. Those people are so 🤮 and constantly get surgery because they&#39;re not gifted.  thank goodness i actually have well defined features. Sucks to be them i guess; Are girls really that impressionable? I’m a guy that doesn’t fit the ideal, but it doesn’t bother me one bit when I watch male kpop groups.; It’s not just the surgeries but they have excessive filters for both pictures and videos. Their cameras have built in filters; kpop HAS destroyed my body image. now i cannot look at even fit people or myself and think &quot;so fat&quot;; All three i picked were non visuals lol😂; Exercise and healghy diet. Dont cut your bones for others appproval, dont cut your flesh for looking good bug pose serious life threats while going through immense pain; I would love to know how many times Momo has been reprimanded by her agency just for being brutally honest about that ice cube “diet” story; the thing that really pisses me off as someone who likes a few kpop groups and has been dealing with an ed is idols messaging their fans every time they gain weight (with the exact measurements ofc) and then telling everyone what their diet is and saying &quot;it&#39;s in order for you to like the way i look&quot;<br>and then the same people are telling their fans not to starve themselves and that they&#39;re pretty no matter what<br>i do understand that dieting and looks play a huge role in kpop but if you&#39;re an idol and you&#39;re against it why spread it among your fans??; Honestly, this is why I hate the concept of „having a bias“. Can we please appreciate everyone and not automatically start ranking people 🤯; thank you for speaking on this, People will preach that kpop diets r harmful but turn around and say &quot;oh my god! yeojin &amp; wonyoung body goals&quot; like theyre not women who have been on harmful diets since their early teens.; I literally chose the opposite of every visual position 😂; in North Korea, you lose weight because of tyranny<br>in South Korea, you lose weight because of chasing trend; For me, it is my acne/acne scars. My hormones are not working the way they are supposed to, and I cannot use medication to fix my hormones or clear my acne. I have tried in the past and paid the prize with an eye that could not function properly for a year due to the side effects of medicines. I guess I will just live with this for the rest of my life.; TW:ED<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this video comforted me. As a K-pop fan since I was 7 years old, I was greatly influenced. I started changing up the way I dressed and my style; basically, K-pop was my style my whole life. Then, as the years went by, I got so obsessed with K-pop that I  thought that they were the most &quot;perfect&quot; people and really wanted to even look like them, and I would look at myself in the mirror and think that I was really ugly and &quot;fat,&quot; even though I really wasn&#39;t. When I was 10 and turning 11, I started becoming more insecure about how I looked, and slowly I started to eat even less. On top of that, some kids, as well as my teacher at my school, lowered my self-esteem and confidence and would say that I was ugly, awkward, and all kinds of stuff. Then, a month after I turned 11, I started calorie counting, constantly lying to my parents that I ate my lunch and breakfast, and then I would have to forcefully eat dinner because my parents would be around at that time. At that time, WIEIAD videos were really trending, and I never realized how little calories they were eating at that time, but I still followed them. I even shortened the size of the plate I used as well as my cultilary, to the point where I would literally eat with teaspoons. Every day, I would wake up, my bones would hurt, I felt like I could pass out anytime, I felt no energy to do anything at all, and I would also get triggered easily. I was always tired and cold; most of the time I was lonely; I would never talk to anyone; I would give an attitude to my parents; and after realizing what I did, I feel really bad now, to be honest. Then I started having a bunch of hair grow on my back, face, and arms, and my hands started turning purple. Every time I would eat something and even drink some water, my stomach would be so painful that I couldn&#39;t even walk properly. One day, things got really bad; I even lost my period, and I told my parents. I was sent to the hospital; I was diagnosed with anorexia; and I had my vitals done and stuff. Turns out, I was underweight, my heartbeat was running at 46 bpm, my blood sugar level and blood pressure were extremely low, nurses would watch me eat all the time, I wasn&#39;t even allowed to walk, I always had to be on a wheel chair, as well as not being able to go to the washroom. I stayed there for 3–4 months. Now, I&#39;m an outpatient. I turned 12, which has been going on for basically a year, and I still haven&#39;t gotten my period back. From time to time, I skip meals because I feel like I gained weight, and I would try to vomit what I ate. I&#39;m 96 pounds, 12 years old, and 156 cm, whereas when I was anorexic, I was 72 pounds, 11 years old, and 153cm. Honestly, I still struggle with loving myself and having confidence, and I even wish that I were anorexic again. I still look in the mirror and think I&#39;m so ugly, and I would rather not wake up the following day than see myself again. I wish that I would look like those pretty K-pop idols with such great bodies, but this video you made helped me realize that they are also starving themselves and only pretty due to plastic surgery and all the Photoshop, so thank you.; I come back to this video from time to time as a reminder. As a girl that has been everywhere from having a green tint to my skin from starvation to being right below a morbidly obese qualification, having a healthy perspective on food and what &#39;healthy&#39; really is can sometimes be hard to maintain. I got into k pop I think 4 years ago now, and it&#39;s hard to not compare myself (a short, chunky, normal-faced person lol) to every idol I see. <br><br>Videos like this really help people like me, but even more importantly help spread the knowledge that these beauty standards we see in idols are almost always constructed - they are not naturally occurring all in a single person, let alone an entire industry full of them. Beauty is subjective, and no one needs to feel like they have to fit into a tiny, VERY specific box of qualities just to be beautiful. Thanks for a great video!; remember these guys are IDOLS. which means people look up to them and idolize them. Then the appearance standards must be higher than an average person&#39;s looks. In short, they have to stand out. As brutal as it sounds, this career is not for the weak-hearted. Similar to a body trainer, you have to train your boy to look good in front of the audience. If you don&#39;t like it, then do not be a K-pop star. there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.; I always bias people based on preference as in personality not visuals because everyone including fans is beautiful in their own way…but with me unfortunately so many people don’t believe that. Just love yourself first and then you will learn to love others; I don&#39;t care what people might say to this but... THE DANCES ARE HORRIBLE. this is not dancing at all just random movement of limbs and just too much. I personally prefer street dancing instead since the movement isn&#39;t desperate for attention but just free; I literally have never heard any of their songs and not even interested when I know personally that most Koreans don&#39;t look like that. It&#39;s called plastic surgery, beauty enhancements and a lot of training to be that way to influence the society.; This is the main reason why I stopped listening to kpop :(; Y&#39;all i have a doubt<br>My skin irl looks different from my neck like my face is lighter and my neck is a Lil dark than my face but sometimes it&#39;s like my face is darker than my neck so does it mean that I got edited irl 💀🤸🏻‍♀️; I get it, like beauty standards are different. I live in the USA and came from Korea. My beauty standards arent popular in the USA. In the USA, we want sharper brows, bigger lips, small noses, big chests, more weight, big butts. But on the other side in Korea, its different. So just look in the mirror, look at your face, dont change it, god gave you a face no one else has, love yourself, we all have our own beauty, it doesnt matter if someone else is &quot;prettier&quot; just know that you are too and you shouldnt ever look at yourself and say &quot;oh I&#39;m not beautiful&quot; you are!; I have a body that will be perfect for female kbs, but im a boy...; I tried to see you video!  however I couldn’t…… sorry; i was wondering if you were going to mention mamamoo! so glad you did (in a subtle way). they&#39;re inspirational to me. <br>great video! so much work was put into this and it shows. this is an important topic, and i&#39;m glad you brought attention to it in a gracious and balanced way.; kpop has made some girls who would otherwise be my type become skinny ghouls that are so weak and unhealthy they can’t even do a single pull up; I don’t see any bodies that are destroyed all gorgeous; The way you focus your last argument is really inspiring. I look at myself everyday and I find in the mirror the person who takes me places, who takes care of my body and soul, who dances while doing the dishes and whom I love and defend above anything in the world. Loving oneself doesn&#39;t need justification, it comes naturally to everyone, that&#39;s why we hate being criticized, so all we need to do (without falling in the narcissistic mode) is remember how lucky we are, and count our many blessings.; About 30 minutes ago I wanted to be a K-pop idol, and now? I still do but I&#39;m slowly losing interest in becoming an idol, I thought about trying out for different companies (the ones I wanted to try out for were SM,YG and HYBE) I was trying to lose weight so I didn&#39;t eat for 3 days, until my mom found out that I wasn&#39;t eating and I had to eat in front of her because she didn&#39;t trust me anymore. During the time I didn&#39;t eat I felt very weak, dizzy, depressed and nauseous, on top of that I also was also practicing my dancing and singing while not eating so that made me feel worse.<br><br>A little more context: I&#39;m 15 and my original weight was 192 now I&#39;m 173, and no I didn&#39;t drop 21 pounds in 3 days, I was using different apps to help myself lose weight while still eating one small snack a day BEFORE I stopped eating completely. <br><br>PLEASE DONT TRY THE METHOD I USED!! (it does NOT feel good, nor is it worth it I just wanted to share my story and maybe help someone else who&#39;s going through something similar!); I struggled with the first quiz, because I honestly couldn’t choose who was most beautiful 😅; tbh, I have tried more extreme diets. I&#39;ve lived off a tomato and 2 tbsp of sauerkraut before, lol.  I loved your video because it is so well put together and I think you make many great points.  I will say this though: we will never give up those standards because it is not so much about vanity.  It&#39;s about stopping the crazy stuff going on in our minds.  In addition, we all know that looks and our bodies do matter and when people say it doesn&#39;t, they sound patronising. Peace be with you.; I&#39;ve wanted to be a k-pop idol, just the idea of dancing and singing for a living is a dream to me, but I&#39;ve always been chubby. When I first get into k-pop I was aware that i wasn&#39;t k-pop idol pretty which makes me feel really bad about myself at the time at least. I still find myself comparing myself to others.. I wish  the mentality around  k-pop changes for more diversity and self love.<br><br>I won&#39;t give up on my dreams just yet though, I know it gonna be hard but i will find my way to it :) ( I know it sounds corny lol and also excuse my English as it is not my first language).; YUP when guys say they like kpop girls theyre so healthy i roll my eyes and say theyre anorexic mate. i my self am anorexic, had to have medications to fatten me up; If you ever saw a Korean nose job and know how it looks you’ll see more than half of Korean idols (actors, singers etc) have very similar nose job. It is not ugly but ever since realizing and just looking 3 seconds and being able to tell “oh they got a nose job” I realized there is no need for me to envy them as much. Of course just a nose doesn’t makes u automatically pretty, but just the fact that so many get the same looking nose it’s kind of funny; Every single time i try to watch a video like this about actual issues it always ends up being an ugly lazy &quot;everyone is beautiful&quot; girl😂; In the end she puts up pictures of ugly people and goes &quot;i think theyre ALL beautiful&quot; <br><br>Tells you everything you need to know about the delusional fools who make such videos; As an asian I don&#39;t see any idol attractive cause everyone looks the same. Nothing special or unique. That is why I only like gangnaam style.; I agree with everything on this videos😭; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TSSjihhQ0&amp;t=230"">3:50</a> the only exception being loona , even tho hyunjin is the visual chuu is the most famous because of her persona; The thing I always found so odd regarding plastic surgery is that... even if they do go through with it to fit the beauty standards, they&#39;ll still get bashed for it for not being a &quot;natural&quot; beauty. People constantly dig up photos of idols during their pre-debut days and debate on whether or not it&#39;s plastic surgery or just styling (make-up, double eyelid tape, etc.)"

Light Skinned Privilege | Decoded,MTV Impact,2019-01-25T17:00:09Z,Do light skinned black women have skin color privilege? The answer is yes! And while we tend to think about people being ...,dE4Lo4TIc8Y,"What It’s Like Growing Up Black in New Orleans | Growing Up Black on VH1: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6vpo83soIk"">https://youtu.be/x6vpo83soIk</a>; Jhene aiko isn’t black; Oops!

As a black person you can’t expect another black person to apologize for having “light skin privilege”. Currently there is no financial or any other privilege for being a Lightskin or Darkskin black person!! Colorism hasn’t been widely practiced since slavery, let’s not forget there was NO colorism in the black community during the civil Rights era! The standard for black has and always been come as you are! Stand up for each other!  Only people who carry this toxic trait currently are self hating blacks who don’t understand how to showcase their inner beauty! Outer beauty will always be judged based off society’s standards which rarely have ever boasted or even acknowledged anything positive about black culture. Tension between light skin and darkskin is pure ego. Nothing concrete that truly divides the black race. As a black person I only see colorism as an excuse for one skin tone to talk down on another. Who is really writing off what Kodak or Kanye west say as law???? Because Beyoncé is in most black peoples opinions more talented than Kelly Rowland that there is something wrong with dark skin people???? Bro Beyoncé is much more talented than any of her other contemporaries let’s not perpetuate made up storylines to “prove” this fallacy. There is no general tension between light and darkskin. Most of the time you even hear team Lightskin or team Darkskin its literally a joke or meme that doesn’t correctly represent black affairs.; My mom and yeah we tell a lot so we don&#39;t ever have to keep any secrets from people; Haha light skin people as mixed with black don&#39;t get me wrong but they 99% smarter as<br>How they is as being confronted And they Just Get It From There Dad And My; Let’s all feel sad for you…; Whites used it against them to hate another PS asap; here&#39;s no such thing as a light-skinned &quot;black&quot; person, unless they have Albinism or Vitiligo which is caused by a congenital disorder. So called light-skinned &quot;black&quot; people are technically (Mixed Race) not black.; Love my rich light skin its privilege ❤❤🎉🎉; This is low self-esteem issues if we had privilege as light skin black people then women want be running to dark skin dudes and always picking them as partner y&#39;all are confusing and conflating y&#39;all love for white people with light skin black people 🤷🏽; I’m biracial and even if I had some sort of privilege I wouldn’t do anything to stop it. Da rk skinned people are hateful towards us and I’ve had enough!; You do know it were your own people who startet the slave trade. Black Slavers sold them to the white.; Every Race is hotter if its mixed.; Im dark skinned and my sister is light skin like our dad...she is always pleasant and down to earth...she was mostly treated bad by other females for no good reason. I felt bad for her because she was singled out  because if her complexion.; 🧢 light skins owns slaved but they never taught y’all that in school; I will say I’m sorry for passing gas, stepping on your shoe or accidentally bumping into you. I absolutely disagree for having to apologize for one’s natural skin color to make someone else feel better. Colorism is a problem that must be addressed but apologizing for your God given complexion won’t make the problem go away.; Most of the dark skinned supporters are light skinned 🤦🏾‍♂️ Here comes karma ✌🏾; The lady talking is pretty and she&#39;s not light skin.; I hate when my family says they are black or we are black when we are brown. Your hair is black and it’s not the same color as your skin; No such thing as a light skin black person. How can a dark person be light skin?; It&#39;s not eurocentric features those are pretty features; People are put off when folks start tryna police other peoples dating choices. That’s what makes a lot of these convos fall apart.; Black people don&#39;t come in multiple different shades. They only have brown and deep-brown skin tones, with brown eyes and kinky 4c African textured hair. The only time that a black person can have &#39;light skin&#39; is if they have Albinism or Vitiligo which is caused by a congenital disorder.; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎😊; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎; 👎👎👎; Perfect job; There&#39;s no slavery in Africa and there is still colorism; Sounds about right; This story is outrageous........leave it alone; I love people, but i don&#39;t wanna have nothing to do with them. Gosh i feel like i&#39;m not from here.; I cannot name 5 , they all did surgeries; If it weren&#39;t for the white man there would be no light skin people.😊😊 Everyone would look like black Africans.; Melonated; Right about the Martin show.  When I was younger watching it, I didn&#39;t realize it but as an adult. I realized how Pam was treated? And that&#39;s not right, even though I know it was a show. I find it interesting. That Martin doesn&#39;t respond to what people are saying about. How she was portrayed with regards to the colorism.; Lizzo to the rescue; No such thing as light skin privilege 🤷🏽‍♀️; Victim mentality; I have NEVER seen this privilege ever. And no I&#39;m not married. I dated a Nigerian one time and he didnt want marry me because his parents thought I was &quot;too White.&quot; Maybe it only applies in show business.; In Thailand they mass market skin bleach and the commercials send a message akin to dark skin being barbaric; Love your skin the darker it is.

I like latinos myself, and white but not so much black, i dont think it comes down to the system but you will try to tell me I learned to like em more like that... <br>As you can see a black man who is not mixed can get success easy like showed in your video. Becouse men are more rated on their skills and women their beauty...; What&#39;s wrong with interbreeding? That&#39;s how evolution happened.; Biracial previlege; FYI Nikki bleached 😂😂😂😂; First of all Mariah was on Steven Colbert show saying herself last year that she is MIXED OR BIRACIAL SHE DOESNT SAY SHE IS BLACK. Jhene Aiko did a DNA TEST AND FOUND OUT THAT SHE IS ONLY LIKE 33% black.  Alicia has a white mother and claims BOTH SIDES OF HER HERITAGE. These women ARE NOT LITE SKIN BLACK WOMEN THEY ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GROUP.; Who is to blame? Those who are light skinned didn&#39;t apply to be born that way maybe you should rather confront bosses personally. We want to see something; SMH insecurities 🤷🏻‍♂️; When I was in school over 20 years ago my school was probably 70percent black and there was a few light skin black girls not many but a couple mixed white or either Spanish and they were gorgeous. And black girls would give them dirty looks and were not nice to them. They never did anything to be treated like that, but they mainly hung out with the white girls cause of the aggression towards them.; I guess one of the things about this topic that people usually mistake is that dark skinned people are considered ugly because they&#39;re darker than light skinned black people, but frankly saying i believe it to be that light skinned black people, since they tend to have hispanic or caucasian facial features than the basic black facial features dark skinned black people so people find them more attractive so it&#39;s basically not about the color but the facial features. to complete my opinion, i gotta say one more ugly truth that i for one think is true. most people regardless of race and age find sharp and narrow nose, just enough thick lips,  not proluding mouth the most attractive and perfect, and i hate to say it, caucasians and hispanic people usually have those features; Nicki Minaj is NOT light skin.; Most of em use skin bleachers; Im light skinned and one of my friends is dark skinned. She is gorgeous but gets the &quot;youre alright for a dark skinned girl.&quot; It is insane. Colorism sucks.<br><br>On the other side of this people have said to me &quot;youre not black.&quot; &quot;Why do you talk white?&quot;  &quot;You have &#39;good&#39; hair because of your mom.&quot; &quot;I only like light skinned girls.&quot; &quot;Only dark skinned giros can identify as black.&quot;<br><br>Honestly I can go on and on about this bs said to me and said to my friend. It really is your own people. We need to stop the colorism and come together.; This is such bullshit; Desperate dark skin people; Sexy Redd<br>Mary J Blige<br>Summer Walker<br>Fantasia Barino<br>Kelly Rowland; The Mulatto demographic needs to be returned. Why are we acting as a junior partner to black people. Theyre the ones saying the word is offensive yet will use the N word as an embrace. Theyre playing games with us and only use us as an economic prop. They&#39;ll even give non blacks the right to say it! We need to stop letting them talk for us.; i feel like when someone brings this up they are jealous just be yourself; Well damn your black and your fine asf !!; So through mix racing you kill the human bloodline the O Negative bloodline African people black people; You study the Rh factor the Reese&#39;s monkey bloodline you&#39;ll come in the true understanding why they hate the black race the African race the white black was made evil because African people black people through the Rh factor the Reese&#39;s monkey bloodline states that the only pure humans on the planet are African people and remember that old saying they hate you because they can&#39;t be you; To truly understand this and who you are and who like the white is and the white people are the neanderthal the ape family you must first study and research the Rh factor the rhesus monkey bloodline where white genetic Scholars would tell you that the only pure humans on this planet are African people black people the O- negative bloodline.; The message of this video is so toxic and discriminatory.

Yall ignorant; WITH THIS LOGIC ICE T IS MORE PRIVILED THEN LL COOL J ?; LIGHTSKIN AUNT VIV HAD A NICER PERSONALITY ,DARK SKIN AUNT VIV F..KED WILL SMITH UP !; Its such a privilege to be light skinned 😂 Yea i get so much privalage my life has been a cake walk. I got any guy I wanted the teachers gave me better grades I got the job first try 😂 You dont know what any one person is going through on this planet and less than half of it has to do with the color of your skin. History is important but not always relevant. I did my research. I see now its going to be for mixed people. I am truly understanding you can be apart of the problem or you can understand God created every single race, skin tone color, hair color eye color. God does not judge us in that way and neither should we judge ourselves and each other . You can do what every one else is doing and point fingers or you can be Greatful to be exactly who God created you to be.; Lmao acknowledge your light skin privilege. Ok so keep the colorism going 😅; Who tf is gene aiko <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE4Lo4TIc8Y&amp;t=22"">0:22</a>….

It’s basically the closer you look to European standard of beauty the better you are.

Just don’t have time to even offer fully analytic comments anymore. Thanks anyway bro.; My favorite black lady media star is @lucretia_macevil She&#39;s got the best YouTube essays.; I really liked this video and you kept it engaging.   We will absolutely argue about Marvel streaming shows (Except Secret Invasion and Moonkinght as we are in agreement on those) but the problems with everything Marvel is rooted in all the comic book BS.

One of my favorite creators on this platform. You are so inspiring!!!; I grew up on upn (and pbs,) basically the only two stations that came in clear on my antenna tv in my room. I didn&#39;t grow up around many black people but through that lens, I think it positively influenced my world view. I still revisit the old UPN shows on Dabl for nostalgia. I never paid attention to their skintones or facial features, just thought the shows were entertaining. I also didn&#39;t really understand how America worked. And I&#39;m also kinda autistic and introverted and just an overall latchkey kid. <br><br>I haven&#39;t put too much thought into, but you are right about the reduction of &quot;black media&quot; in this streaming era on TV. Thanks for the education on colorism, it&#39;s a topic that matters. I see it a lot more in present media than I did as a youngin - sports especially is when I first started to truly notice it.; Anyone remember the brief period of time where The Walking Dead tried really hard to pioneer having a strong darkskin woman as a main character and even then she gets a lot of her person removed compared to the comics; Here&#39;s a like and a comment for engagement! <br><br>&quot;If you aint goonin you aint living&quot; 😂😂😂; I will accept zero Domino slander she need her own dam movie; Appreciate your insight and depth on this topic bro cause i talk about a lot of these points with friends.

Man isn&#39;t afraid to admit he&#39;s treading trodden ground and ask for corrections if he&#39;s wrong. King shit.; The funniest thing about this vid is how your fake right wing heckling is literally indistinguishable from actual right wing heckling. It&#39;s kind of weird how all those people pulled themselves out of poverty in the easiest way possible. You don&#39;t have to be funny, smart, charismatic, or attractive. You just have to SAY THE WORDS. Then you got Texas oil money and/or Kremlin money. It&#39;s the Tim Pool model for success, just remember to perpetually wear a beanie to cover up your hideous melon. Anywho, I made it 4 eps into She Hulk. I definitely prefer blind lawyers that beat the shit out of dudes and feel guilty about it because they&#39;re catholic. I also prefer Wandavision, because dealing with grief and having superpowers will mean more to me than being a lawyer and dealing with superpowers. Man, you&#39;re a well paid lawyer.

Your videos keep getting better and better.; The first actor/actress that came to my mind under 50 was Lupita; Thanks again for this video. I really enjoy your perspective on these issues and willingness to talk about things that Black women also go through. I know that’s a tough line to walk, but you do it in a way that adds to the conversation and doesn’t overtake.; Another banger Jawn!!<br>Thank you so much for making this video. It’s nice to have more Black men speaking with us about these issues. Cuz trust we get ignored, called bitter, and talked over. I am always harping on the rampant colorism in media and it makes it so hard to enjoy things. It is so rare to see Black women of my skin tone, mind you, I am not even on the deepest end of the spectrum. Especially in roles that are not the typical low-effort, stereotypical characters. <br><br>I highly encourage y’all to check out shows like: Chewing Gum and Black Lady Sketch Show (absolutely amazing. Black women in every kind of role). <br>I love horror and I love that Jordan Peele has made two movies with deeper skin Black women as main characters, who are whole people. Fully fleshed out and have really wonderful characterization. <br><br>I’m a pretty big gamer, so this is always a really painful sore spot for me, cuz deeper skin Black woman as main characters in a video game is basically non-existent. However, I love what Sam Lake did with Alan Wake 2 and getting to play as the other protagonist Saga. She has such an amazing story and it’s the first time I’ve played a video game with a Black woman (she’s Bi-racial, but whatever) as a playable protagonist, with her own story, and fully fleshed out character. Not via character customization. <br><br>Ok I am gonna stop here cuz I can talk forever about this very specific topic.; &quot;Delta Male Feminists&quot; 🤌; I&#39;m here to trash 48 laws of power any day every day all day; First person I thought of was Quinn King, Aunt Viv (new, then old), then Dr. Brooke Taylor. Damson Idris, Serayah, Uzo Aduba, and Malcolm Mays.<br>&quot;AI is Steph Curry&#39;s spirit animal.&quot; Took me tf out. 😂😂😂😂😂; Goonin Goblin needs to get on the Truth Social! 🤣; The characters Jawn Louis makes always crack me up. The conversation is not for me, I just wanted to say I appreciate you upping the acting and editing for the video essays to include these side characters.; Across the Spider-verse had a Black Spider-woman. She was pregnant.; A thing I hate about colorism, is that it&#39;s often used as another method for palm-colored people to define what being black is. It&#39;s infuriating.; “Ya know, I’m something of an Alpha, myself”- the Goon Goblin, probably; the khadija and intelexual sources for this video 😫 this is gonna be good; As a fan of narrative games I’m annoyed you didn’t mention Clementine from the Telltale Walking Dead series when listing badass black female characters.; The facial hair on the alpha bro drag is AMAZING. Too real 😂😂; Easily one of your most entertaining videos, I can see the effort paying off for sure; THE GOONIN GOBLIN JAWN I AM DYING; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQisWV4n6XM&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> 😂😂😂😂😂😂; Another great one! Absolutely dying at the shots to saberspark!; She hulk? Racially ambiguous? Thats a white woman 😐; Im greatful for this channel. Im only half way through rn but from my vantage point (late twenties, black woman), colorism seems to be worsening in the media and in day to day life. We really do need more folks like you sounding the alarm. When we do it, we are jealous or WE get accused of colorism as if it works the other way around. Colorism is prejudice against dark skin people. If you&#39;ve experienced harrassment from being light skin, you&#39;re story valid and deserves to be heard....but its not fuckinh colorism. The erasure is astounding. Please keep it up Jawn; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQisWV4n6XM&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> What the hell was that!?; Great job!; More topshelf content from Jawn. Keep it up!; Hey Tiffany is alright in Tuca and Bertie; OH SHIT YOURE BIG ENOUGH TO GET A REACTION FROM GOONIN GOBLIN NOW; I like the spoof of Conservative grifters, funny stuff; support the channel; chat I know this will be a good one chat bro the wokes won&#39;t get our media bro chat trust me bro the woke mind virus bro"
The Fascination of White Skin in Asia,Gastón Gardey,2018-05-16T23:58:44Z,This is my final Project in Ethnic Film Class. The objective of this school project was to talk about an experience I personally have ...,mzK3w7DIiu4,"This is white race hate campaign... Anti white is not good for society... It&#39;s just their culture; Excellent vid, thank you. Terrifying to see how much stupid pressure is on people to conform to a ridiculous (and in my book, lesser) ideal. Everytime they showed a woman lighter than before I thought - nooooo, she looks better in the before shot!"

Not sure if its only L&#39;oreal/La Roche Posay or if there are good Asian ones our there too?; What do you use for body sunscreens?; Thank you! Your videos were very informative! ❤️I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve already made a video on cruelty-free brands, but could you please name a few brands?; Hi, can you tell us about the  best Korean  sunscreen stick?; Please in russian subtitles; I can&#39;t believe I am just joining your channel (where have I been)! I love your informative, yet honest content. Apologies if I have missed this in your videos. I am 49 with melasma and didn&#39;t realize that I should be using a mineral sunscreen instead of a chemical one. I have very dry skin and noticed you like Isa Knox, but was not sure if it was a mineral sunscreen that you&#39;d recommend for dry, aging skin with melasma? Would you recommend it for my skin tone? If you have other recommendations I would greatly appreciate it as my search has been endless. Thank you so much in advance for your patience and time.; I&#39;m a little sad that some of the good ones are fragrance. My skin is so sensitive.; You deserve more subscribers, your job is awesome and very honest. Thanks a lot.; I FINALLY got my hands on Hera Sun Mates Laportes today and cannot wait to give it a try.

I couldn’t find it anywhere 🥲; Hi odile, please recommend me a daily sunscreen and a outdoor sunscreen for very oily and acne prone skin ( fragrance free); Thank you Liah Yoo for bringing me here. I get to discover this wonderful lady who knows what she’s talking about.; So all of these are chemical sunscreen?; Thank you Odile. I use San Cut spf 50. I&#39;m wondering if you ever tried this. So light and sheer. I love it. Im going to try one of the sunscreens you mentioned here.; Hi! I am quite keen on Isa knox spf, could you pls suggest if this would work on darker skintones cause I am an NC40 and I would only like to purchase if this won&#39;t have a white case.; I tried the Dr G sunscreen based on this video and omg, I have never used a more awful product. Not only did it have a whitecast that would not quit, it pilled, does not work under make-up. After about three hours it started flaking to my horror. Maybe it leaves no white cast if you have a very pale complexion ... but for the rest of us ... no way can you use it.; Thank you for sharing these! Your videos are so insightful and informative.

Christine; Like Khuelle, I would like o know more about Isa Knox...; Hey, great channel, I am very happy I found you :) I want to express my sadness with a lot of those strong outdoor Korean sunscreens - they all contain octinoxate :/ Those European sunscreens that got the highest proven sun protection, all had either octocrylene, avobenzone or oxybenzone. I tend to avoid these 4 filters as they are perhaps potentially endocrine-disruptive. I prefer hybrid sunscreens or those filters like Tinosorb S, M, octyltriazone, Ethylhexyl salicilate and similar. Would you recommend me a specific sunscreen that would be nice in that category? Outdoor and daily? :) I liked the old Purito a lot, specially because it was mildly dewy and hydrating. Thank you; I wonder where La Roche Posay&#39;s anthelios sun cream comes in. Is it suitable for outdoors?; Great video!; Can you cover more Isa Knox products?; Very informative content!

Thank you it means a lot to me; I was looking for a review on the CNP laboratory sunscreen and found your video. Thank you for sharing! Although, I’m still afraid it might leave a white cast on my dark skin due to the zinc oxide; Hi. What do you think about corsx sunscreen ? I heard many good reviews so I&#39;m thinking of trying it; Odile, I am brand new to your channel and I am already obsessed!  I love this video!

Looks great ❤ I&#39;ve been eyeing Isa Knox for some time but couldn&#39;t find any reviews! Will try to get it soon.; Hi Odile , what&#39;s your opinion on the Innisfree daily mild sunscreen ?; Thank you for this video. I purchased the CNP outdoor fluid sun. But mine says &quot;Fresh shield formula&quot; &amp; it&#39;s 75ml. The one you&#39;re using in this video says &quot;Fresh waterproof formula&quot; &amp; is 80ml. However on your blog, you have referenced images of both the formulas. I&#39;m confused 🤔<br>The one I got has a semi-matte finish on dry skin. However when I apply it after my regular skincare of essence, serum, vit C etc, it&#39;s thick and sticky 😭 I have normal-oily combination skin. Is there a difference between the 2 formulas? Any inputs would help 🙏; Hmmmm I thought Dr g green mild up sun is physical sunscreen???; I would love a video about isa knox!! Describing their best products, which ones are best for anti-aging, and which ones you use the most.

Thank you for pointing out the difference between outdoor and daily. I love your recommendations; Would love to learn more about isa Knox!; I don&#39;t know if you count as an influencer, but I like how you&#39;re different from many of them because you, like one of my other favourite people, Minsooky, really go into the pros and cons of certain types of cosmetics and skincare, the myths about East Asian beauty trends that are perpetuated by ill-informed editors, and what brands are cruelty-free among many other things. You&#39;re not just here to make us buy products. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us,  I might pick up that Physiogel sunscreen :D Currently using Vision sunscreen, but it often ends up in my eyes D:; You looks great in this video. This hair and make up really suit you.; Great video!

As such, your order was cancelled and refund was processed.<br>On the other hand, after contacting the supplier, the price was increased, and unfortunately we had to adjust our prices.&quot;<br><br>Your honest &amp; unbiased reviews SOLD OUT probably one of the best Korean sunscreens product  from STYLEVANA platform within 72 hours!!!; I like how your videos introduce me to products overseas-based influencers don&#39;t mention often, if at all! Also, all the details you give, both on the side AND showing the application process are very useful.; Isa Knox sunscreen kinda reminds me to anessa perfect milk, have you tried it?

Great content as always ❤️<br>But can you recommend me sunscreen that doesn’t irritate eye area? Some people suggest me that I should wear sun stick but the idea of rubbing it on delicate eye area doesn’t sit right with me. And other tell me to use physical sunscreen or non-perfumed one. But the one that doesn’t irritate my skin is Intensive UV Sunblock Cream by 3W Clinic that has perfume and hybrid type. Is this brand ok? Because I can’t find much information about this brand.; Yay! Finaly :). Thank you for this video &lt;3; Dear whoever is reading this, I wish there was a way for everyone to erase all sadness and stress and just replace it with happiness. You have an entire galaxy and a beautiful life ahead of you.

Never forget that! <br>Sending much Love over from Germany ♥️♥️♥️; You should be 10X more popular ❤️❤️; Great video! Can you suggest more on firming or anti aging products for 40s maybe about Isa Knox as mentioned?🌹; Out of so many beauty &amp; skincare content creators including dermatologists/aestheticians on YouTube, hundreds of contents of (mostly Asian) sunscreens yet you are the first person to clearly define one of the most important difference between  outdoor &amp; daily sun protection creams/lotions. The rest of us, even though clearly mentioned on the label, jump to criticize but failed to recognize due to lack of knowledge! <br>Much appreciated your highly informative content Odile.; As usual, Odile makes me want to buy everything 😂; Nice to see you again Odile!!!.. loving your reviews thoughts and opinions about products!!. I am so glad you specified the difference between daily use sunscreens and outdoors.... I am soooo excited to try all these new Korean sunscreens!!!. AFTER all the scandals I was left a little  disappointed 😞.....Thank you for your review!!!.. greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱😀; Hola Odile, Como siempre muy buen video y muy buena explicación; &quot;Shocking, I know.&quot; hahahhhah! Great video, thank you for mentioning fragrance, I only buy fragrance free.; Have these sunscreens been tested?; I would love to hear more about Isa Knox and O HUI brands. I need to try your recommendations :); We missed you Odile💗; Hello Odile! Thank you for great video! I would love to see video on Isa Knox 🤩; Thank you so much!!!; Thanks for this video and as always, good information. I don&#39;t think any of these sunscreens is fungal acne safe but I now know about Isa Knox. I will check other of their products.; Out of these korean sunscreens, which ones have the highest PPD and would be most suitable for oily acne prone skin?; ❤️; Thanks for the video! I recently enjoy using a mineral sunscreen by Mdoc, which feels I little bit greasy on the start it and leaves some white cast. And it has kinda old-fashioned fragrance. However it feels great on the skin unlike most sunscreens available in my country. It&#39;s manufactured by Kolmar Korea.<br>A video dedicated to Isa Knox would be great! 😊; New subscriber— so glad I found your content. Thanks for making these remarkable videos. Likes from Texas 💕; I need a (korean) perfume video!!; Does any of these sunscreens burn around the eyes? Thanks!; Hi, Odile! Ty so much for all the knowledge you&#39;re sharing with us which sparks a question: why is that all these brands you mention aren&#39;t &quot;well known&quot; in the beauty guru&#39;s space? Why is that only a handful of K-brands are pushed into the international market? ✨; Yes, Isa Knox, please!; Have you tried the round lab birch juice sun cream? Its a great hydrating daily sunscreen!; Great video as always, Odile! ❤️ Would love to know more stick sunscreens too since most sunscreens end up stinging my eyes. I have heard great things about AHC and Isntree stick sunscreens.; Please make a dedicated vid of Isa Knox; Very good video! I am definitely buying the Isa Knox one. Sounds like the perfect match for my skin. I have only tried Dr G among the ones in this video, and I agree, it&#39;s amazing!; Hello Odile, Thank You for another informative and entertaining video. I would LOVE to see a video on Isa Knox: Thank You.; I have been so looking forward to this video! As someone definitely interested in skincare for maturing skin I personally would love to see a video on Isa Knox😊; Thanks for this amazing video! I had no idea about &quot;outdoor&quot; sunscreens 🌞 <br>What do you think of the IOPE UV Shield Sun Protector XP SPF 50? 🤔; Excellent video.  Even before the controversy, I used the daily sunscreens as part of my daily regime especially when I am not going outside.  Sometimes I treat them as moisturizer.  I have the heavy duty for outdoor activities or if I am going to be spending time outside when it is very hot.<br>I would like to hear more about Isa Knox brand; Another excellent video. I learn so much. I had experience only with Hera and it&#39;s was really really good. Thank you.; Your hair looks super cute in this video! Love the content and can’t wait to add these to my shopping cart!; Most skincare YouTubers (including derms): &quot;No no no!!! Fragrance is bad in your skincare!&quot;<br><br>Odile: Let me give you a whole collection of perfume starch using sunscreens!!! <br><br>I&#39;m obsessed!!!; Please tell us more about Isaknox 😉; Adds to basket adds to basket,...oh wait, only Yesstyle ships to my country 😭; Do anessa; Can&#39;t wait😆"
Dark skinned black woman bullied off TikTok over a blush! Golloria and YSL controversy,Tinta Manengu,2024-09-28T16:52:06Z,Dark skinned black woman bullied of TikTok over a blush! Golloria George and YSL lavender blush controversy.,vR0gAQe5sGo,"I want to just hold her. As a dark skinned girlie who was around when we ONLY HAD Iman’s make up line not show up as ashy, I will protect her at all cost. Imagine going to get your makeup done for prom like all your friends and coming home in tears because you look a gotdamn messsssss and the only excuse you got was “ your skin is too dark”. This was 2004. How dare yall come for this girl! The work dark skin creators have done to get shade ranges that actually match our skin tone and under tones is immense, just so yall can now say “ just use something else”…. Bruh!! Go back 20 yrs and tell little ol me to “use something else” so I can ask you “ what else?! There is nothing”. There is no feeling so disheartening then knowing the skin God gave you is seen as bottom barrel. Protect our dark skin creators at all cost. They have crawled and walked so yall can run, now stop running your mouths disrespectfully.; Thank you for this video. I agree.; Yall are so beautiful tho; Alt right blush. 😂 calling it now.; The first young lady is a cry bully herself tbh….Going around calling other women ghetto snapping at everybody I witness it first hand she try to be like a Shera Seven but it’s not working out for her so emotional and snappy some people need to stay off the internet do inner healing ❤️‍🩹; I don&#39;t understand why people would send hate to Golloria for just stating that the blushes don&#39;t work on her skin tone, when giving opinions based on how products work for them is literally what all beauty influencers do! All YSL had to do was market their blushes truthfully. 🙄; This breaks my heart into a million pieces. She is SO gorgeous, as are all the dark skinned <del>girls</del> goddesses in the world. As cliche as this is to say, I think the fools who bullied this beautiful angel off tiktok did it foremost out of jealousy. And also colorism/internalized racism in the cases of other Black women partaking in the bullying.; Because people view us a ghetto loud and rude and because some bad apples we unfortunately get lumped together which is bs I am my own person; Sometimes, I really h-te humans. Stuff like this realy makes me h-te humans. I have extremely toxic relatives, but even they have never put anyone down for their race or complexion. My dark skinned aunts, uncles and cousins were called beautiful or handsome as often as the rest of us.<br>I&#39;m biracial, very fair and didn&#39;t even know black ppl putting other black ppl down for being dark was even a thing until I was around black ppl outside of my family. I was born in 1970 and had hoped we&#39;d be beyond this by now. I&#39;m sorry for anyone that has ever had to go through such bs. Maybe those of us that know dark skin is beautiful need to be louder than the haters.; That&#39;s why I wear MAC cosmetics. They have colors and shades that work with my skin tone.; My uncle had the same thing in your eye and in time it covered his pupil to the point that he couldn&#39;t see clearly he got it taken care of but I suggest you get it checked out as soon as you can😣; but she&#39;s so beautiful!!!! People are so weird wtf???; crazy how not being on these apps make a young dark skin niqqa like myself more comfortable in they own skin; The White Tik Tok diva ate this up. Mama was speaking straight facts.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR0gAQe5sGo&amp;t=728"">12:08</a> SPOT ON!!!; Exactly 💯, its not just the other races on rhe sly, but other black people themselves are full of hatred and bullying and its not hidden. All of the fakeness and fake love, pretending to be fair on social media, when dark skinned people hate each other; “Your skin tone is your entire personality” she’s making videos of makeup, and doing reviews to help other women of color with their makeup since the industry usually focuses on pale skin. Why is that so hard for people to grasp😭😭😭; This is when you get inspired and take over the industry for darker women. Take that negative to the moon!; Chiiiiile u r so very beautiful n I thinks it’s mainly ur complexion. Not to say u don’t have pretty features but that dark skin is  ur prettiest feature IMO. It’s impossible to be considered beautiful by everyone because of personal preferences and that’s okay.; That black girl is beautiful I love her skin tone ❤; Her skin is gorgeous and literally flawless she definitely doesn’t need foundation or blush she’s gorgeous just some lipstick and mascara and she looks like a model; No offense, but every color will not work on every skin tone, that doesn’t mean they are morally wrong for making it, and what where they suppose to say on the package “not for dark skin” ?!?! lol could you imagine the backlash, if you can’t make something work for your skin tone DONT buy it<br>There are ALOT of deep plum colors that don’t “work” on fair toned skin, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t exist for the deep toned women that they DO look amazing on, same thing here; Im sorry im seeing too much victim blaming in this comment section and its heartbreaking to me. The fact that our own is saying &quot;just buy from your own&quot; when the brands SENT IT TO HER! Let darkskin women use their voices and BE HEARD!!! Stop it. Its actually pissing me off how yall our being purposely tone deaf amd saying this stuff. Golloria makes videos that are NOT inclusive to us so we can go to the brands THAT. ARE. INCLUSIVE. The fact that yall are not denouncing the racists in her comment section and just saying &quot;just buy from your own&quot; just proves that yall never understood her content or what she does. Oh but lets just blame our own instead of the racists. K. Cool.; The world doesn’t need to cater to you. Stop crying and buy brands like FENTY and others who do create products for your skin tone. Every brand has their audience they target, if it ain’t you, it ain’t you. Move on; I’m sick of men in makeup honestly; Black Women stop always buying white peoples makeup and get mad when it don’t match Go get some Iman or Fenty I don’t feel bad Stop white shopping just to complain girl bye; Real World issues Happening Around The World, War, S3x Trafficking, Child Neglect, Kidnappings, Murd3rers, etc.. but these women are worried about a stupid blush color.... SMFH! These women are trash! There are way more important things in life to worry about, than worrying about the color of the paste you apply to put on your clown 🤡 face. Bimbos!; People do and say the most but I wouldn&#39;t let anybody bully me off 💩; Sure, it&#39;s great that really pale people have something that works for them but women with really dark skin just don&#39;t have the same. Everyone deserves makeup that works, from the whitest white to the darkest chocolate. We all deserve some variety, not just ONE option. Once brands figure that out, they&#39;ll start making a lot of money. This comes from a pale skinned person who can&#39;t always find products that cover the redness in their skin without feeling like wearing face paint.; This pisses me off…. Dark skin is so beautiful!; &amp; they wonder why dark skinned/African blk women/girls don&#39;t associate w/ brownskin/american or lightskin/american blk women/girls…or nonblk women/girls🤦🏿‍♀️look how they treat us unprovoked.; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR0gAQe5sGo&amp;t=1117"">18:37</a> what the hell?? There are so many things wrong with what they said here, it’s absolutely infuriating. It’s insane that dark skinned people have to deal with this shit; Everyone should defend Golloria. She’s amazing.; Evil behavior by the marketing team. Also very cynical of the &quot;exposing golloria&quot; person to use albino people as a point of argument, when it wasn&#39;t even marketed to them.; So glad I don&#39;t buy make up. Apart from mascara I&#39;m au natural. My beauty regime is simple. I wash my face with water and place oil on my face. YSL or whoever not getting my money. Marketing doesn&#39;t  fool me. I got more sense than money.; The company is playing in your face!! They are doing this to create controversy. Controversy creates free publicity. Very risky but that’s what I think they did; Dear black women conversations are like this are meant to keep you angry while many people are collecting coins from it. Everything said is true but don’t forget to breathe and live your best life. ❤; The sad part is that more non-black true yt women understand and support her than the black-African and mixed-race, and those considering themselves brown. When I saw her upload I said finally. Someone is focusing on truth instead of messy talk, racial issues, or ghost stories.; Every creator talking about the blush: “My issue with the product is its marketing, claiming it is universal and the obviously edited images showcasing the blush on darker skin.”<br><br>Three billion IQ people in the comments:<br>“Its not for you duh”; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR0gAQe5sGo&amp;t=760"">12:40</a> it’s rage-baiting. Utterly ridiculous. Everyone needs to prove them wrong and boycott them. You have to hit these companies in their pockets. Remember, YSL is also a legacy brand, as is L’Oréal - they need to be taught a lesson. <br>Support the people that look like you first, and that make better products anyway for a better price!; I took a really long hiatus from make up. Like from way back when I didn’t even understand I had an undertone. I’ve been back for not quite a year and have learned so much. It’s too bad this madness is happening and I don’t know everything but I do listen and it’s ok to do that so you can try to empathize even if you can’t truly understand. We do have eyes and ears to see and hear it going on. Everything is so deeply imbedded it must be called out for the change that’s needs to happen. Beauty is one of many spaces that needs change. This capitalist system is rotten to its core imo. Those in power of many if not all industries are ok with it all cause it works for them in every gd way. Then they keep us fighting with each other so we don’t ban together and fight them. You have to want to know and seek out the information so you can learn all that we weren’t taught in school on purpose. It’s no wonder they make so many things inaccessible to so many including education.; No because harassing someone out of the internet over an overpriced blush you probably wont even buy is crazy; One thing that I hate about saying that most of her detractors are fellow Blck people is that by default, her biggest supporters are fellow Blck people. I&#39;m also tired of Blck people trying to force inclusion when the focus should be creating our own and being exclusive. Most of the world is darker skinned, so there is a huge market. YSL did this on purpose because look at the huge marketing this has created for them, which means more attention and more dollars. Idk how many times over 500 years those people have to tell you all that they don&#39;t deal with you.; I would totally sub if they&#39;re on YouTube. This is as close as I get to Tik Tok.; Ok, but doesn&#39;t that lavender shade remind anyone else of Edward Scissor Hands?; The makeup industry purposefully screws up most makeup not because of racism! Ya know why? Consumerism! So most people regardless of skin colour and undertone, have to pull Houdini tricks out arse with eyeshadows paint liquid lipsticks and primers in order to make one product suit us. This is a consumer issue, not racism. They want us to be pigeon holed to be forced to spend more money so everyone has to pull tricks out arse! Which means what? We&#39;ve to buy more more more! regardless of knowing this it goes to back of head when there are new releases all the time. Even the ones aware of it and are genuine Mua&#39;s with moral compass will get sucked into the consumer ism of &quot;I know I know I shouldn&#39;t of but I saw the adds and had to try it&quot; an then they&#39;ll go on to say how even professional makeup artists don&#39;t do sponsorships or very rarely do get sucked into buying something that then became buying multiple things thy daily basket to forgive all those who led them into temptation like they a feckn priest read&#39;n out da hims an woedy woe&#39;s of do&#39;s an donts but ah sure do it anyway 😂.; I find this specific influencer to be annoying and self depricating. All she does is complain! When she complained about not having contour for her skin I was over it! The purpose of contour is to literally add shade and dimension back to the face. If you are already darker skinned..there is literally no way to mimick shadows on the face.. These blushes looked great on me and my friends. Everything is not for everyone🤷🏽‍♀️; I will die on the hill that YSL targeted her the knew their products wouldn&#39;t work on her skin and that it would cause uproar. They did not care how it affected her mentally all they cared about was the views that they would gain from this conflict; I was in her comments once and I said that I should not be the darkest shade of foundation that a line offers somebody thought it would be a good response to inform me that I&#39;m not that dark so it&#39;s okay; That girl’s fiancé and dad are awesome.; So the brand don’t have a problem…but the people who probably aren’t going to buy it do ???😂; these blushes are horrible; I hate being darkskin so much; They are playing in our face y&#39;all....; I&#39;m still trying to figure out why black woman wear blushes. We don&#39;t blush at all; The same people bullying her in the next turn are all about helping children not be bullied…bunch of hypocrites. People want to pretend to do the right thing when it’s convenient for them.; Just toxic beauty culture; Put gold powder on dark skin much better; It&#39;s a shame. This woman is beautiful. She helps other dark skinned women. What&#39;s wrong with haters?; We have our own Black Brands of Make Up/Cosmetics from pioneering brand  such as Fashion Fair to present day Fenty both of which are excellent &amp; the many other Brands of Black Make Up in-between, so i cannot understand the need to even acknowledge yet alone consider make up/cosmetics that are not compatible nor are they manufactured by or for Melenated skin.👎🏾🤮<br>Could it be this Brand now requires Black consumers money? Happy to target &amp; expliot non wyt consumers? <br>YSL make up is not relevant or inclusive to women of colour it&#39;s just that simple🤷🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️ it&#39;s not a problem, we have our own top draw Brands of Black Make up/Cosmetics.😊; Can blacks stop victimizing themselves so much, the world doesn&#39;t have to go over you all the time people are sick over you&#39;re stupid speech you&#39;re sick with all-inclusivity get over and learn to live with it; My bf is a chemist. The answer is to be what is needed. If we aren’t even in the spaces where formulations are created-inclusivity will not happen consistently. <br>I am not on that other app but I feel like seek to create a line for dark skinned women. We cannot expect yt people to consider what they literally have no experience in. And they keep telling us-to keep your coin. So keep it. PR or not you don’t have to feature companies that see you and your $ as an afterthought. <br>Now the colorism-we know that a lot of times the only thing that can be deeply hued is a man but also that’s not even most of us . But internalized hate and bias is deadly. <br>The only way we can get there is to be and of our own.; Dark skinned girls like me, getting the short end of the stick, per usual <b>sigh</b> <br><br>I wanted to be light skinned so bad as a kid that i bleached myself. I didmt work (thankfully) but i got bullied everyday about how dark i was. Funny thing, wasnt coming from white people, it was coming from my black peers! Why do we do this 🫠; Karma for all these demons who say and tire down dark skin women especially our men they do this as a hobby and others they are the reason why so many bleach everywhere in carribbean and America.; Also, this was a very good video.; Honestly, the explanation that the woman gave regarding the process for selecting these colors is why I only purchase makeup from manufacturers who make products specifically for black women.; It makes me mad. She&#39;s such a beautiful woman. We (black women) can be our own worst enemy sometimes.; The issue is, if you are white - everything is already created with you in mind. If you are black or even brown are now excluded or not even part of the thought process if you are not jennifer lopez or beyonce.<br><br>The problem with the black community worldwide,  is we are still locked in the slavery/apartheid mindset. To be light is to be close to white is to be close to perfect. <br><br>If you are dark,  you are just good enough to either be ridiculed or sexualized. We are rejected by our own kind men and women alike. When you go with a white man ooh you&#39;re a sell out or he is just fetishising you. Basically if you are dark you&#39;re not worthy of anything.  It is so sad to be black. I love it and hate it at the same time. If only we could see how powerful we could be, united...but it&#39;s easier to tear each other down instead like crabs; it’s sickening how quick black women are to tear down a darker woman who wants inclusivity. this is the  DEFINITION of crabs in a barrel mentality. people don’t realize that inclusivity is a win for ALL of us, no matter where in the skin tones you fall. i seriously thought it was white people doing this , but as a black woman, why wouldn’t you want all of us to be treated equally? at the end of the day, we are all black in YSL’s eyes and they clearly dgaf about us. i don’t care how well they rework or if they even rework their overpriced blush! won’t get a red cent from me.; it’s definitely not universal..$40 hell no!!; 😂😂😂Black people better be worried about what’s to come, not this foolishness. Your priorities are missed up! 😂😂; My heart goes out to these content creators. I do not create content but in my profession, I&#39;ve had to work so much harder to achieve a seat at the table and to be heard and validated. It&#39;s heartbreaking to see what these beautiful women endure at not only the had of others but at our own. I&#39;ve lived it and I had that for the subsequent generations to still have to endure it.; NYX lavender/ light pink <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR0gAQe5sGo&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> butta blush is a great example of a light blush that can work on all skin tones beautifully. That formula is veryyy universal and proves that it’s not just about the color. If NYX can do it YSL should be able to too. That concept though was clearly not on any mind cause they don’t care for it to be 🤷‍♀️; She&#39;s very pretty. Her complexion is smooth and even. Sometimes insults come from envy...; It&#39;s very simple, we won&#39;t be buying YSL.; I&#39;m an Eastern European woman and I&#39;m sad that in Eastern European beauty community, our women demonize dark-skinned women for being &quot;spoiled&quot; and &quot;demanding&quot; because of this lavender blush, when the issue wasn&#39;t about the blush itself but about how it was advertised. When I tried to address this issue, women harassed me in the comments because &quot;we don&#39;t understand this Western obsession with inclusivity, not everything will work for everyone&quot;. Like, dark-skinned women, by their belief, don&#39;t even have a right to complain about false advertisement.; Fashion fair, MAC, black opal, Bobbi brown, NARS and makeup forever have always been some of the most inclusive brands or specialized for POC. But people turned their backs on their brands for these luxury companies or the brands influencers were pushing. Al someone who works in the industry during the social media boom I saw it with my own eyes. <br>Go where you are celebrated.; I will never buy a YSL product ever again and I liked their perfumes. If you have to resort to deliberately instigating racism from your core customer base against black women, clearly you have told me you don&#39;t value me as a customer. Nope, YSL will never see my money again.; Thank you for sharing this.; If it makes the dark skins feel better cardi b got cheated on and yellow bone is not what he wants😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂; It&#39;s soooo simple: This Lavender shade is inclusive but not &quot;ALL&quot; inclusive. YSL promoted it as being &quot;ALL&quot; inclusive which this blush is not by showing people with dark complexion with this blush and advertising it as such. This is wrong. YSL sent this blush as a PR to Golloria so they should be prepared for the honest review. Hands off to Golloria for speaking the truth. End of story!; She&#39;s not ADOS. SHE&#39;S AN AFRICAN.; I love dark skin women ❤; Tupac and Micheal Jackson said it better &quot;the darker the berry the sweeter juice&quot;but at the same time it&#39;s hard for feel bad because we in 2024 going on 2025 got to stop playing stupid just be more confident if it makes you women feel better in the real world men really do smash anything so stop crying or backflip into a shallow pool of your tears; I&#39;m so saddened  by the last creator&#39;s post. I would havr followed her positive content.  It is so sad that our community doesn&#39;t come together to lift each other  up. Let&#39;s do better.; The sign off message was very well stated. Kudos to this brave young woman.; The bigger issue is black women are more accepted when being ratchet, sexual or belligerent.; Can African American woman sue them?; I fxcking hate this world, i hope i get reborn as an alien on a different universe 🙏; I get stares EVERYWHERE I go no 🧢. I am my skin and I put that shit on. People are in awe of me especially when I dress like I’m the one . People are INTIMIDATED by a dark skin woman with high self esteem. They are caught off guard. I know haters be like “how dare she”😂😂😂😂; I felt her pain. As someone who is the darkest one in my family and who was so bullied in school about my dark chocolate skin color, it hurts. The “you’re too dark” comments - in school, people would say if the lights were turned off, I’d disappear or say “too ugly to be forgotten” referring to my dark skin because being dark was seen as ugly. I just want to embrace all dark skinned women and assure them that it will be okay. Today, I’m in my 50’s and it’s taken me this long to love my deep, dark, beautiful skin color. I’ve learned that if someone doesn’t like it, that’s their problem, not mine. I feel that we have to start with ourselves first. Stop tearing down other beautiful black women. Accept that all our shades are incredible and then go from there.; Have NEVER wasted much  money on make up. If I buy makeup I go directly to Mac or Fenty as I see there they try to consider me &amp; people that look like me.<br><br>I am a VERY DARK SKINNED woman. I save my money &amp; focus on building my skills in being good in IT &amp; such places where I can use my brain to make money 💰 for me to live comfortably. Then I try to save 80% of my take home. I use the same foundation for YEARS coz I wash my hands to keep germs AWAY &amp; out of the bottle. I use SAME eyeshadow that I sometimes get for free when I do my nails.<br><br>Eyeliner, do brows &amp; boom I’m DONE. I also don’t waste my time on men that will gaslight me into believing I’m less than so they can abuse me. <br><br>My hair is natural so I stopped spending money at the hair braiding store where my hair may be pulled out of its roots or manhandled.<br><br>Everything is literally a scam made to enrich the top 1% who mostly are male and their CEO enablers. When I fail financially there’s no government bailout for me. <br><br>So I basically buy only what I NEED &amp; what makes me happy. They will not see a penny out of me on things I don’t need.; How is the issue of inclusion still a thing in 2024? Just blows my mind😮 I mean do companies want to be crucified by customers, surely please surely they must know that these products are anything but inclusive? Are we back to Hourglass days? Oh mannnn; I&#39;m going to say something, and I believe in a lot of people are not going to take it seriously. The makeup industry is racist at the same time not racist. There is multiple makeup companies that are made specifically for One race and only for one race, also at the same time there is multiple makeup companies that are made for everyone. If you&#39;re going to be a beauty guru or content creator I feel like it&#39;s very important to know that. There is companies that are specifically made for black women and only for black women. There is companies that are made for every race and skin shades out there for the world. The makeup industry is very counterintuitive. The makeup industry constantly prove that they can be for and against any moment they have. The makeup industry again is very counterintuitive. Is almost like every side is right yet at the same time wrong, I&#39;m simply speaking with logic and also observation. The last couple of minutes of the video Gloria and the other woman they were cocking it they were saying tea. What they both just said was fact,  factual.; I thought blush needa to be blended down but I agree everything is Not for everyone... maybe it was for Halloween??? Lol; The exposing Golloria thing made me nauseous.<br>This person has a freakin hate boner for her. They literally don&#39;t know anything about the situation and made a whole powerpoint about it. If they did know anything about the situation they would know that the product wasn&#39;t &quot;not made for her.&quot; It was literally marketed as universal and that is one of the most basic facts of this situation. <br>They&#39;re all for inclusivity but they admit capitalist greed leads to shades for her not being made,,, and she shouldn&#39;t complain because that&#39;s just how it is?????? It&#39;s nihilist and conformist and cowardly. Just be honest and say you don&#39;t care about inclusivity and would rather make excuses for mega-corporations.; The colorism and self hate that blacks have for one another dosent invalidate RACISM!; I do not get this at all.  I live in an all-white suburb,(2% black population), and since 2021, our local CVS only carries mostly black and brown foundations. We can’t get any ivory or neutral foundations because they have been crowded out of the shelves by darker shades that sit there un-purchased as there is no one in our community to purchase them. Companies and stores should look at their target purchasers and demographics and create and stock accordingly. It is laughable to see all the middle aged white women, (who can afford the $50 foundations), strolling through aisles of un-purchased make-up designed, (with large posters), for black skinned women searching in vane for the makeup colors, (including lip sticks, eye shadows and blushes) they purchased there for themselves for years. These companies and stores are going to go out of business. They re so afraid of being cancelled 😂😂😂.; At this point, i would only mess with fenty products; Who is that creator with the white dress and white background? Anyone know her name?"

The Iconic Korean Anti Aging Skincare Brand You Should Know About: Meet Isa Knox,Odile Monod - The Monodist,2022-10-07T17:30:04Z,Do you know what was the first certified anti-aging skincare product in the history of Korean Beauty? In today's video we'll take a ...,YZb0T1CaUG4,"I wonder why Avon sells Isa Nox products, is it the same conpany?; Excellent, very informative and complete video. Thank u :). Do u know a site that sells Isa Knox and ships worldwide?; I would love to try this eye cream. How can I get it delivered to UK?; ❤❤❤❤; Stumbling on your site while I was reading up about retinol products.  Please let me know when should apply any of the products you had mentioned in this video.  Thank you; Happy Holidays; This is the most informative and interesting discussion on these products/this brand. Thanks for creating such quality content. I ordered some samples (Tervina) and love the products so far.; Hi Odile , i just followed you today my problem it’s black dark spots and wrinkles, can tell me witch of your product I should buy? To clear my face; Hi Odile! Thank you so much for all of your hardwork on contents like these! I recently discovered your channel a couple months ago, and I have been watching every single video on your channel 😂<br>I tried the brand Isa Knox, and it quickly became one of my favorite K-Beauty brand! I am obsessed with the whole Age Focus Prime Pro-Retinol line, especially the Ampoule Skin and the Eye For All Cream. The line makes my skin really moisturized so I can better tolerate my prescription retinoid. I’m also in love with the Mela Care For All Cream as well 🥰 The UV Sun Pro and the Te’rvina AD cream are on my wishlist to try next, even though the cream was supposedly for older audience, but I have dry skin so…I might still get it 😂; Hello, thank you very much for the interesting video. Do you think,  it is possible to use the Tervinа Lumiere line with a retinol ampoule from the same brand, Isa Knox?; Ola! Sou do Brasil! Gostaria de pedir gentilmente, se possivel, colocar legendas em português. ❤; Girl proceed to say skincare brand powered by &quot;human placenta&quot; with no hesitation and shooked &quot;in weird dora face&quot; ahhaahha 😂; Thank you very much for all your valuable information.<br>Can you do a video about moisturizer for the body please?; I&#39;m back to this video for an informative refresher in light of the prima elixir release! I&#39;m not sure I <b>need</b> it but the tervina line sure sounds impressive :); Really love the first geniture line; I just found you and I&#39;m watching all of your videos! I was going to buy the history of whoo products that you&#39;ve recommended in your videos but now I&#39;m watching this one and I don&#39;t know what to get now 😅 Please make a video where you tell us what you&#39;re using in your routine, maybe that would help? Thanks for the great videos!; I’ve been into K Beauty for over 5 years at this point. And after discovering your channel I’m really curious as to why so many of the brands you talk about, I hear very little of when they seem to be so highly regarded in South Korea; I love your channel and all the information you provide.  I am new to Korean skin products, but I have only purchase those you recommend for my skin type.  Any chance you could do a  video on male skin care products in the future?; I used the Charmzone Control Cream years ago and my mind was blown at how great it was! It was fun to use, my skin felt good and I remember the congestion around my jaw became almost non-existent. I think I need to revisit this type of skincare product, I reminisced on it recently!; I really appreciate your content. I was wondering how these types of products compare to western products marketed as DNA repair enzyme products?; Thanks Odile for the great vid. Now I know why it is called Isa Knox😅. I tried to find reviews on the Melacare cream but unfortunately unable to. In you opinion is it really effective in targeting sunspots and melasma? Many thanks; Amazing as always! There are two topics in particular that I have seen little spoken about regarding K beauty in the Anglosphere.  I wondered if you knew of any resources regarding Rosacea and Salmon/Sturgeon creams? <br>Can’t wait for your next video.; Odile, your attention to detail and wholehearted reviews are always eye opening and precious. Thank you so much. Going to share your video...; Your videos are worth waiting for! You are a high level teacher❤; Thanks Odile for another fabulous video. I love your channel and your content. I am 55 years old and I want to buy a good skin products for my  mature and dry skin. I am undecided if I should invest my money on Donginbi products or Isa Knox the golden line. Please advise me. Here a fan from GA, USA.❤; 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹; Are you Italian?; Coming to your channel is so refreshing, it opens up my view of skincare to beyond what is just available for the western market ❤👏; Oddie , also give us body care recommendations.; Nice as always 👏; Hi. If we have to pick 3 to 4 products to treat pigmentation and mature skin what could that be. From history of whoo, Donginbi, Goodal or isa knox or iope. Kindly tell out of them that can be part of daily routine n give skin a glow too; Thanks Odile!!! You’re the best !; Thanks Odile. incredible presentation. I found your channel a few weeks ago, and I must say ... I total enjoy how informative as well as interesting.<br>You&#39;ve introduced me to the Korean beauty products and history. I&#39;m in the above 40, brown skin and reside in the US, but looking forward your recommendation geared towards mature demographic.; Thanks!; Such an informative video, thank you 🙌<br>I own the vitamin C ampoule because a beautiful kind soul (and also Olive Young 😂) gifted it to me, and I can&#39;t wait to start using it! Even if I&#39;m used to stronger vitamin C formulas, the rest of the ingredients of this ampoule looked very interesting and I&#39;m glad you confirmed my impressions in your video. It&#39;s even more exciting now 😍😍😍; Hello, thank you for all your videos. They are so well done I feel as if you could teach a class on skincare. I would enroll in the class and study every day! 🥰🥰🥰; It&#39;s such a pleasure to watch you talk! And this video I&#39;ve been waiting for so long! Love the length of it ❤; Love that you said you are allowed to enjoy your products! Really appreciate these brand and products breakdowns because I&#39;ve been very interested in Isa Knox but wasn&#39;t really sure where to start 🤩; Either I could buy the product for the U.S.; Thank you, this was another very informative video.; Hello hello we missed you😊; Thank you very much for this very informative video!; Oh la la ❤❤❤❤; Third? 🎉; Yay! This is gonna be so worth the wait! ❤; First"

I have shared it on my twitter; Well done swetha. ...; Wonderful thought so true and everyone should follow your words; I&#39;ve even experienced this at school where fairer girls were chosen to dance even if they could dance well!; Yeah, I think, fair n lovely should be banned completely!!; Well said.. I feel the same about some of youtubers. These days I dont watch much... You are so real.. i believe you will come with a SV brand soon 😎; OMG! You are my woman crush!! 🤗; Lakmé. Are you DARK SKIN FRIENDLY It’s 2018, the beauty industry has changed, and Lakmé only has foundations that suits fair skin complexions. Let your voice be heard by signing our petition to Lakmé Cosmetics to include darker shades. Say no to colorism, and stand up for DIVERSITY.<br><br><a href=""https://goo.gl/PbwuQG"">https://goo.gl/PbwuQG</a>; Would enough Indian women buy makeup that matched their skin though?  I grew up in America  but am of Indian origin (my parents).  Every time I saw the aunties and cousins on my moms side of the family, they’d talk about color...how my mom shouldn’t let me play outdoor sports because look how dark I was getting,  so and so’s daughter is too dark to make a good match etc. These same women, still wear makeup that’s too light for them even when there are shades that match them better from mac, Fenty etc.  Last year, my mom ,myself and my daughter went to an engagement party.  My mom doesn’t usually wear makeup now that she’s in her late 70’s and a widow, but she insisted on borrowing my daughter’s instead of mine.  My daughter is half white and wears a Mac NW 15,-20.  I had my usual nc42 shade which also matched<br> my mother.  At the party, you could  tell for the most part where the  ladies had been brought up by how their foundation matched them,; even though they all had access to makeup that matched them better.  This fair obsession gets passed down generation to generation with big business further promoting it.  it’s all about money.   If there is little or no demand for lighter make up and skin lighteners, they won’t make them.  Don’t let actors\actresses and companies tell you that lighter skin is better.  Public figures such as actors and actresses  have a responsibility to their public.  Imagine promoting a product by advertising that  it will improve your chances at work and marriage by making you lighter skinned. These people are morally bankrupt.; Wat a powerful video! U asked the right questions to the so called influencers. As u rightly said, it&#39;s so difficult to get a foundation shade that matches me. I use PAC which gives me the perfect match. I was so annoyed n disappointed to see Tarte&#39;s release. Wish we had more people like u. We hear u... This in no way was ranting... I have gooseflesh every time I hear u... I feel u represent us so well... Thanks a million...; Would you buy from a racist beauty brand?<br><br>No?<br><br>If you wouldn&#39;t buy from a colorist brand then why would you buy from a makeup brand that discriminates against the majority of Indians who are dark-skinned? It’s time to stand up to Lakmé Cosmetics and demand darker shades that suit Indian complexions. India is diverse so why isn&#39;t Lakmé?<br><br>Stand up for your dark-skinned sisters, brothers, cousins, friends, and loved ones.

And your lipstick is bomb ❤; I can relate me bcoz I face this same in my personal life also when I buy makeup sales women or men show me fairer foundation......I just hate it....thanks for this  vedio; most famous youtubers are also lightskinned..more profitable to back them ! Except for you i haven&#39;t come across a duskier skin youtuber doing well !; We Indians love white skin on women..white is automatically beautiful here ..this being the mentality cosmetic giants just cater to it.Knowledge of foundation base is also ..i have seen people using foundation to whiten themselves !; Thank you for addressing this issue.; love it; Hi Shweta.. i just found you and saw this video and bam! I so agree with you when it comes to Indian brands giving a flying f@#£ towards deeper skin tones. A few yrs ago lakme introduced it&#39;s foundation- the one that came in the black ball thing.. i went to a mall and at the counter I realised it came in 3 shades and the darkest was 3 shades lighter than my nc 42!! I remember that day well since that was the last time i bought anything from lakme!!  Done with that rubbish snooty overpriced bs. I headed over to the nearest mac outlet and got myself a proper shade even though it was too expensive on my student budget. Point is even thou its 2018 brands like lakme n revlon introduce just 5 shades only for their base! We should be condemning brands like these.. there are a few low price range brands out there I am sure but not one of them will cater to someone who is say nc50.. Let alone as you say brands who are cruelty free, vegan etc..<br>Thankyou for putting your voice out here and let&#39;s hope for a future where Indian brands give more representation to women who come in more shades than ivory, light beige and pink fair!!; Kudos to you dear for coming up with a strong and much needed awareness. Yeah every skin tone is beautiful and this cosmetic brands jus promote only the fair-skinned people. Atleast from now on let us all raise our voices together 😍😍😍😍; This is why I hate Shah Rukh, he is an opportunist. Even though he is so rich he still endorses Fair and Lovely. He has no &quot;need&quot; for their money but is still so greedy and cheap that he will endorse those products.; Well said..finally there is some one to raise voice..hats off..love u..i am a great fan of u shwetha..keep rocking ❤️😘; I appreciate your views.. I too feel there is still narrow mindedness in terms of skin color in India, especially in the north.. My friend is dusky, due to which sometimes she feels less confident because of the world around her.. The world has no right to harm the self esteem of any person. This world needs people like u to speak out their views and make a change. Hats off!; I have now fell in love with you 😍 I totally agree with you and what I love is u are very passionate 💕💕; This was no ranting  ...every word u said  is true ..YouTube is full of idiots promising white skin permanent fairness diy etc  ...u shud see the no. Of views they get...it&#39;s shameful how obssesed we Indians are with velutha niram or fair skin; To be honest, the two of the biggest Indian Youtubers doesnt even know how to apply makeup for example cut crease, halo eyes BUTTT they represent themselves as Beauty Influencers. And you expect people to get off the PR list? Nah that aint happening Girl.; I just came across your channel and BOY AM I HAPPY! Thank you for using your voice! You’re doing a great job! “If you come at me saying I’m racist, I swear I’m going to block your bloody ass!” 🤣🤣 love it!!!; Ooo 😮 wwoww shweta wt a kick for those make brands nice 👍🏻 job 😘; Though I am unrelatable I just came across this video...personally I understand the mindset of Indians and I really support you....<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23againtstracism"">#againtstracism</a>.   <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23supportshweta"">#supportshweta</a>; Amazinnngggg!!!!! This is so true😘; Somthing tht needs to b discussed; I agree with it..most of the indian beauty brand commercials shows only fair skinned girl even most of the bollywood actresses are fair..isnt it unfair?; We have the same issue in israel .<br>Im nc 37-42 in mac dependend on my ten and im having really hard time to find my right shade. That is just disappointing.; You are the best youtuber. Everyone else is so saturated with their thought and content.; The best video I have seen in a while . This is coming from a white girl; How can we trend this ?; You go girl ❤; Absolutely right u r... I dont have any knowledge of cosmetics actually as i dont use any.  To be very true i watch ur videos to watch u only. I m in love with ur looks yaar. U r damn beautiful. I know my comment is irrelavent... But i said what i felt. :); Maam... Your video is amazing... Plz plz share u r views to other youtubers also; You are so brilliant to take this as a topic. Why isn&#39;t this trending?; You’re bang on girl.. what a messed up world we live in.. when a child is born, Indian parents ask what colour the child is.. 🤦🏻‍♀️  not whether the mother and child are healthy and well.. <br>I went to Sephora to get a sample of the Tarte foundation and concealer. Came home and tried it on. Hubby said I look like a Pakistani bride.. lol 😆 <br>They didn’t have a shade for me and I think I’m a Medium Tan. So I watched your review of The Ordinary foundation and went with that instead.. saved a ton of $$ and am quite happy! 🤪; Well said dear..totally agree....; Well said Shweta! Respect your boldness.. A tight hug for taking up this subject 🙌; I really agree to you...thank you for speaking us for us dark skin girls....salute you; So so true I am fed up with being color matched to freaking pink toned foundations; I think La girl, smashbox and Mac have shades for us brown/dark skinned girls. Your points are valid though!; They even disrespect dark olive skin tones like myself. It&#39;s crazy. Many are afraid to say anything for fear of retaliation from the brand. It&#39;s sad.; WOW ! You just voiced my thoughts. Everything u said is so true. Luv u girl :); Genuine talk,I really respect the way you presented 😍; Very well said❤️😘; great.. finally someone has raised their voice for dusky beauties...yes we&#39;re always taken for granted and biased when it comes to beauty guidelines; 👏👏👏 great content.....; Love your video darling...this should viral as much as possible; It’s so fucking annoying!! Though loreal maybelline try to cater to deeper skintones, the shades that they release in India aren’t close enough. Everyone is so mesmerized with fair skin, this includes everyone. Even us (though subconsciously) like those fair girls in the ads. We need to change our mindset and bloody start admiring colours in the skin. Wish everyone rants equally good about this and brands start noticing. Period; Very true shweta. Not even cosmetic brand people have same kind of mentality. People have fair skin is liking very much whether she is not beautiful. I have same kind of experience in my life. Although I m smart &amp; beautiful but not very fair skin. Still I m getting so many issues like that; Thank you! Shweta❤️💞; Yes! 100% agree. This video needs to trend!; Muah.. love you for bringing this up. Growing up in a small town in kerala, the only brand i had access to was lakme. Even the darkest shade available in lakme was so not meant to be for anyone who is even slightly on the darker side. And when i use them, i used to get flak from people that i am using makeup etc... Anyway.. even now, its only loreal or Maybelline that i can find my shade in india.. that too not a real match always.. unless i go for high end brands, i never find my shade... Thumbs up to you dear 😘; You missed to address the famous “FAIR &amp; LOVELY” ad. Trying to convey wrong message to the society that brown skin or dark skin isn’t good enough &amp; encouraging people to lighten their skin by using their useless product. Growing up as a kid I had tough time concerning my skin tone. And these stupid ads are definitely making an impact on many of the young brown girls that they are not good enough because their skin colour is brown or dark; I love you!!! And you are absolutely on point! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect"">#respect</a>; U can never get ur true shade in lancome dior n the new jouer foundation..; Hi Shweta <br>Where did You get the gold chain you are wearing from..<br>I’m looking for a similar one ..; A very valid point/concern brought up by you Shweta and hats off to u for being so fearless n brave n hope ur  voice reaches the dumbf*#@!beauty brands. <br>  n hope this vid changes the dirty mindset obsessed for gorapan. 👍👍👍; Never in my life have I ever watched any video so intently But this video. This is a sad fact about beauty parameters set since ages. We Indians were always brown skin n never ashamed of being shaam varna/being saavla. ever since the brits came people started believing being fair or white and slim is divine/beautiful. since then only women  who were fair n slim were considered beautiful. thanks to Hindi film industry for inculcating it further.; 👏👏👏👏👏  Grrrrrannnd salute to you girl 😍; This is quite unrelated, but kind of in the same vein of thought : Today while I was buying clothes online, I thought how much better that makes me feel as opposed to in store because then I&#39;m labelled a certain size, &amp; ofcourse heavy girls are made to feel ugly. People only have to see size charts of different brands to see what they make of you, &amp; it kind of helps with the viscous thought cycle. Anyways.... I&#39;m digressing; my point is just like representation of different skin tones makes us feel beautiful, similarly different label sizes can too. It&#39;d be so great to see realistic looking models in fashion industry too though 😕; Cough cough Nyx India&#39;s page. They have so many many pale people &amp; foreigners. Social Media influencers &amp; bloggers etc praise nyx so much, but the India page doesn&#39;t feature many Indians. Even wet n wild&#39;s page, similar story in India.; You&#39;re completely right about beauty pageants &amp; cosmetic companies. &amp; again right about brand ambassadors of makeup companies. We never see people like Konkana Sen, Bipasha basu on big banners. It&#39;s always the lighter women.; Wonderful; Wow u nailed it !! 👏🏻👏🏻; WOW !!!!!! Hats of to u Shweta👌👌👌 such a gud topic  to talk about.... Really #<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23more"">#more</a> respect  for ur honesty....💕💕💕💞💞💞.... M wheatish n m prouuuud of my skin😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍### luv u even more now💖💖💖💖💘💘💘💘; Grt video. India is a huge market but taken granted. I m also struggling frm getting d right shade since many years; Love this Video Shweta! So glad you spoke up.. I can totally relate to this.. I’ve actually made a similar video that will go live this weekend and I hope our videos makes an impact, even if it’s small.. A small voice is better than no voice.. 💕🤗; I feel you Shweta. You have hit the nail in the coffin. This shit has got to STOP! We need more foundation shades for tanned yellow-undertoned or medium to dark skinned women. Loved your rant! This is the shit we deal with. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hail"">#hail</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23preach"">#preach</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23listen"">#listen</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23timesupmakeupbrands"">#timesupmakeupbrands</a>; Finally at least you came up 😘😘😘 this is really needed. And other you tubers they don&#39;t open up about these issues else brands will stop sending free kits😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂; Spot on Swetha Di. People associate beauty with fairness just because these brands promote fairness and they use fair skinned women as their ambassadors. I mean, ain&#39;t we humans ? You have to imagine my horror when I saw my face after putting foundation once. I was terrified of what I saw on the mirror. I looked so ashy, you won&#39;t believe. Coz of that, I stopped using foundation and also face powder, coz I simply can&#39;t find a right shade for myself !<br><br>Another thing that irks me a lot is that people also think that being slim is beautiful. And whoever has a bulkier frame is ugly. I have a friend who is married. She is always compared to her husband&#39;s cousin sister who is slimmer than my friend saying she is so beautiful, she is so slim and all. The poor thing is depressed because of that. I just wish more big and more big brands will have plus sized women as ambassadors and models. <br><br>Kudos to your courage to speak about something like this openly. I am with you in this Di.; Proud on u chechii...❤❤❤❤; Please make more such kind of videos; Well said chechi 😃😃; Well said, Dear!; Respect Swetha chechi... It was like someone talking what in my mind. <br>I don&#39;t know you remember,We had a small chat about my skin tone and marriage ,anyway that&#39;s my battle to fight. <br>But like you said about cosmetics , I wanted to try makeup when I was in my college days and I still remember buying the Lakme foundation and after applying my horrified face on the mirror. <br>I was never able to find a perfect match for my skin , not only in foundation but even the face powder. <br>Once I became cruelty free I stopped using foundation bcz either this foundations are costly or unattainable. <br>One of the reasons I follow YouTubers like you and Mr.Jovita because you people give us confidence that our skin tone doesn&#39;t define us .<br><br>Thank you for this , please continue to be our voice and we can hope other beauty influencers will also join with us."

The distaste for this country I was born into is even stronger. Sometimes, I wish I was born a white person in a first-world country. I hate everything about Sri Lanka. The people, the culture. It is internal racism. And it is a burden.; I can’t believe adults act like this; Any dark skinned people who decide to give up the darkness,  u will regret it!; And yet there are people who risk skin cancer by tanning,  trying to obtain  dark skin. Without dark skin...there would be no michael jordan, simone biles, whitney houston, etc! People are just about nuts!; Lady in white, on the green sofa, is fire!🔥🔥; I am a light-skinned Black woman in the US, and I totally understand that there are hardships that dark-skinned women endure but light-skinned women don&#39;t.  All mistreatment makes me sad. However, maybe there needs to be a word that refers to the bullying that light-skinned youngsters (like me) endured as a child from darker-skinned girls.

Some of the most brutal, over abuse of dark skinned people I have witness is in East Asian media. Colorism is not just experienced by decedents of of Africa (and that includes going back 200+ years). Because or European imperialism and the spread of White supremacy through colonization historically, Asian and Latin folks who are dark skinned ALSO experience deep bias toward their skin town and complexion. Skin whitening is considered a normal part of regular skin care ACROSS all of Asia  (for instance); 2024 Everyone Loves Darkskins and Everyone Hates Lightskin MEN!!!; I feel, as a black woman, it&#39;s exactly down to us to fix the problem and redefine the narative on our terms.

I&#39;ve experienced tons of self doubt hate even from my own family they&#39;re all light skin the things I have experienced were horrifying to the point that I wanted to commit suicide. My own mother wanted me to use Whitening soap after a long day of exercise outside when I was playing basketball, I got kicked by my brother in the back when we were watching TV cuz he said i&#39;m absorbing all the light that stung me till now I was 10 years old. The things I&#39;ve experienced in society that only benefits the light skinned people hurts me so much. Even in social media in the Japan if they see someone who is tanned and doing some normal mundane stuff like dancing they&#39;ll get laughed at and called ugly... This world needs to change.; Dark skin, big backside, whith teeth,  is African beauty.; theres a real fact of physics at play here though, that black is literally dark and white is literally light. darkness is literally the absence of light and carries connotations of mystery, danger, the unknown, the unseen, difficulty to trespass or discern or understand... it seems a juvenile and inconsequential point, but I think its quite at the root of fear and unrelateability that exist in this superficial barrier.  you can literally see the shadows on lighter skin easier and perhaps have a perception that you can read them better or relate to them, as long as they are expressing, or you might find them less mysterious or less dangerous, appearing to be less adapted to utility in outdoor environments. <br><br>much like neonatalism can be comforting and attractive, retaining traits of youthfulness or child-like features, assisting in social cohesion and establishing supports.  babies benefit from being noticed, thus they are cute and loud, etc. at some level lightening makes sense in all ways to some degree.  of course, its negligible most of time-- you arent literally going to lose track of a darker baby... but there willl probably be a tendency which favours recognition and attention toward lightness by physics alone; from a predominantly scottish community, people seem to notice the slightly swarthier complected, though don&#39;t expressly discriminate.  I fail to notice the difference perhaps because of exposure to a much broader spectrum, rendering these details as extremely small to unnoticeable; Beautiful brown Skin  is amazing..✨️✨️..the Sun kisses it with more enerG .....melanin coated💫🥂🙌🏿; I m almost dark skinned and hate every inch of it.

Most of it is all in their head.<br><br>For the love of God, just get on with your lives, not all of us look at skin colour, let alone how dark or light it is.<br><br>Contribute to society positively; To be honest out of my whole life i only had two incidences of discrimination by my own people. One i was at a dance and a dark skin boy walked by me and made the sound of &quot;ugh &quot;. I just turned to him and said &quot; i can say the same thing about you &quot; and walked away. The next incident i was in a club and a ligh brown brother just walked up to me and said i normally do not talk to dark skin women but i find you to be a very beautiful dark skin woman. i literally laughed at him. But , he was so mesmerized he gave me his number. I never called him. These two incidents are the only time i faced colorism amonngst my own males. Thereafter ,  i can honestly say i have dated men of every shade and race. I had female friends who were of various shades and at one time my best friend was of biracial background who was a cream shade who labeled herself as black. I in no way allowed anyone to demean me because of my hershey chocolate skin tone , and if anyone did i would immediately go into a history lesson of how shade was created and a line i would start out with is the white mans Bible of subjection to keep people of African DNA subjected to their false superiority . But , it starts out &quot; from darkness came light&quot;. The darker gender is the most feared because of the potentency. Know this. It is a potency that can transform pure white to obsolete. We are seeing it today. Asians are not white , native americans are not white. Hispanics are not white , arabs are not white and of course african dna are not white but they can lose their purity by mixing. But know , that color will wipe out white.; Can we just add, that british black people DESPERATELY want to join in with ANY black AMERICAN problems. They dont have the slightest idea. They just absolutely love to play a victim in england. A black american who moved to the uk would get a far more positive experience than america and more opportunity! <br><br>The fact these clowns are preaching malcome X quotes just shows you how DELUSIONAL they truely are here. The guy was a BLACK EXTREMIST. He woke up towards the end of his short lived life and become aware of his hatred for whites and also his islam extremism.  So guess who took him out ? Muslims ! 😂 You can&#39;t make this BS up !  Smh.<br><br>If black americans decided to all dye their afros green. You best believe the black british will follow them like blind sheep 😂 <br><br>Everyone in the uk knows EXACTLY! How it is here.; Being a white man with ancestors from northern europe, I think this is very interesting. We never had any concept of colorism in our family or community. We just were what we were born with and never thought about it.; Hatred for what? I&#39;m black Africa and I&#39;m proud. I have never liked white skined any way; I don&#39;t think light-skinned people hate dark-skinned people, I think it&#39;s more about being afraid of being dark-skinned. I don’t think people pursue skin color, what everyone pursues is class and recognition. So if we bring more dark skin people at the front, the world would automatically became more diverse, because we get to see more dark skin images, especially in the entertainment industry…. Young people are all there, we need more dark skin stars in the industry, we really need more!!!!!!; I love Tan, I really want to see this now; I’m so glad at the beginning the woman with the short hair made it clear the difference btwn colorism &amp; the comments that some light skin ppl get that’s unfavorable.

We shouldn&#39;t let what people say define what we look!!; The dark skin colorism is sooooo real especially in USA.; The short hair lady didn’t seem to be understanding that lighter skin/mixed race people face colorism also. The experience is harsh when no one accepts you…. You’re not dark enough and you’re not white enough. Black people sometimes hate their own lighter skin black people. It’s sad, because “light skinned privilege” leads to a lonely world. Speaking from experience my friends. Why don’t we all just stop judging and help each other no matter the color of your skin.; I’m ultra pale alabaster white pro max, so I kind of relate in the opposite way. “Go spend some time outside, get off your computer, get some sun, get a tan”. Person at work walking in: “reveal your arm”, “what no, I burn quickly even indoors” , “let me see” “fine”. (I show my arm, and they start showing off how tan they are compared to me). “You ghost” “whatever, dude”; Skin bleaching is a very ancient practice dating back to mostly east Asia. East Asians are already fair skinned but like to be even paler, because of social class (indoor person: rich and pale / outdoor person: poor and tan aka fieldworker). Europeans before the 18th century and in vitctorian era also used skin bleaching products, because it had the same meaning as the Asian reason, but during the industrial revolution everything changed. Poor people started working in factories, stayed pale and developed Rickets (vitamin d deficiency caused disease), so rich white people started going on vacation and sun tan to show off they are rich. I’m Irish so I’m always pale (in the sun I only burn), so there is that.; Within the black community, light skin men and dark skin women face colorism.; Most white people try to get tanned skin so if they thought whiter was better then no one would try to tan 😂<br>They are against whites because they are the only group with diversity within itself. ie<br>Hair colour - brown ginger black blonde <br>Eye colour - blue brown green black <br>That’s why their against whites.

As a mother of a biracial child I couldn&#39;t ever imagine anyone that I know call her the N word , let alone me calling it to her...I&#39;m sorry to anyone who has ever been through this xx; Loved this conversation.; So many unintentional revelations. So they had to endure majority-&#39;non-black&#39; classes but they live in northern Europe? What&#39;s the point of discussing colourism wearing weaves or long Disney Princess-style wigs?; they are all so pretty; Well done! a good documentary inviting everyone to join!; Stop hating my black skin and my black features and my black existence . All my blackness is made of love .

Growing up i was friends with a black girl. Trust me when I say that I wasn&#39;t treated better. I was the short one with bulging eyes and she was a long legged beauty; Colorism might be the most important issue we face. Five of the  most successful blacks (President Obama, Beyonce, Mariah Carey, Halle Berry, Alicia Keys) have white people in their bloodline. And many  of the people who benefit from colorism don&#39;t see it as a problem. There&#39;s a black talk radio station (900 am) in Philly. It&#39;s rare for them to talk about it. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re no longer living in the dark ages when old media was the only game in town. We now have something (internet) that lets us communicate.   These actors (Zendaya, Alexandra Shipp, Thandiwe Newton) have spoken about colorism. Whether you agree or disagree with their opinions you should try to get as much info on this topic as possible.  For the record I&#39;m a black man. I&#39;m not very dark or very light.; Whitey stop haunting me with your whiteness; if it&#39;s ok to make fun of or discriminate against someones height, then its ok to discriminate against skin colour; I noticed skin bleaching is quite a thing in S.E. Asia.; Great to listen to people&#39;s experience and thoughts on colourism etc.; <b>India is POISONED with Colourism. Fair skinned Pakistani girls are very prejudicial.</b>; I would love for a more inter-sectional conversation that included...

All that plays into the package as well.; Great conversation and quite informing.  How come there is only 1-male person of colour on the panel?  It would be interesting to get the perspective of BAME Male perspectives.; We are all black...that&#39;s where we all started.; Luv you Ladies and Tan. You all guys are gorgeous and beautiful.  Thanks for sharing !!!; I would like to say, as a Caucasian woman, that, to me, all people should only be based on their insides, not their outsides.  To me, your entire panel is beautiful, highly intelligent and deserve to be treated as individuals, only, and respected as such.  I realize that I have never had or comprehend the challenges any of you have had to contend with and firmly believe that no one should have to face them.  I look forward to the day when no one is based on their external appearance and are just based on who they are.  I learned a great deal from your panel.  Thank you for having the conversation and expressing yourselves so eloquently.  Best to all!; Pathetic. I cant believe they&#39;re forcing native Britons to pay for this shite.; The BBC higher ups should be dragged from their offices and politely told this is not ok.; Great conversation. However, what about hair type and colourist. I see there were some people on the show wearing wigs. We need to go a lot further and see the beauty in tight curly hair and proudly promote. Even if you are light skin with c4 hair, you are seen by some, on a lower standing than someone light skinned and straight hair type.; What is this rubbish? BBC have lost there minds.; Great conversation. I&#39;m so happy to see this talked about across races. It&#39;s seen all over and needs to be addressed; Go woke go broke; Everything starts with you not the west Be the change don’t talk about the change; Unrelated but saying non-blacks is just as rude as saying browns and stuff; So if somebody with light brown skin gets abused for being &quot;lightskin&quot; it&#39;s not colourism? But if it&#39;s the other way around, then it&#39;s colourism? That makes 0 sense. <br>It&#39;s basically saying the darker your skin is the more of a victim you are prone to be, and anybody with a lighter tone can&#39;t be on the receiving end of colourism. <br>It&#39;s basically the same argument as &quot;black people can&#39;t be racist&quot; <br><br>Interesting topic nonetheless,, and respect to these people for speaking so honestly; Amazing and long overdue convo, which we’re far from ending and truly healing from; 😳 What The Actual F!!! 😳<br><br>😲 What Have I Just Watched?!?! 😲; Woke BBC!!! 🙄; 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾"

I really didn&#39;t mind the seriousness of the situation until you pointed it out on this video.

They say something like if you have dark skinned lips that means you either smoked / impure / doing drugs or other bad things . <br><br>Like bruh it&#39;s just my natural lip colour :0; Honestly, I used to feel bad about having dark skin until I realized the true history behind it all and that melanin is worth $395 per GRAM more than gold. If someone makes fun of you for your dark skin, realize that those people are not thinking freely for themselves, they are believing in a narrative that has been pushed for years as a result of social conditioning. It plays a bigger factor at role and has nothing to do with you. Love yourself and rock your skin.; Colorism is still an issue and will be so if not addressed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1Vc4VXqH-g"">https://youtu.be/y1Vc4VXqH-g</a>; I am a red-headed very pale white-skinned woman from Europe and I have always been made fun of and many times even attacked by strangers about my skin color. I&#39;ve been in the tanning salon a zillion times but I can&#39;t really get darker. Life is so unfair, I have been bullied all my life for my skin color and feel that I need to hide my limbs in the summer, cause people (especially my own Caucasian race who tan well)  will badly comment about it.; Omg he Australian oh wow they still exist on the internet.; Latina HERE!<br><br>Thing that I heard growing up<br>- Oh my god she is pale <b>with a smile</b> (talking about a baby skin)<br>- You are very pale, has anybody told you that you look American <br>- Your skin is so white, I would like to have like you<br>- This color suit you because you are pale<br>- Pale people look good in every color <br><br>, when my sister told her classmate that her last name is because we have family from USA, the classmate told my sister, &quot;really! but you do not have blue eyes and blonde her to be from usa&quot;.<br>When my sister told me that, I was a little angry, I know that girl didn&#39;t mind to offend us, but that is straight up ignorance.; I’m an Asian and I always feel like my skin should be lighter 😐; I&#39;m a biracial black person whose more on the darker side, more caramel, and one of my family members used to constantly call me &quot;brownie&quot;. It took me years for me to truly appreciate my skin color and to love it 💖; What kind of a lacking Soul does it take to teach anyone that skin color pertains to having ethics, a moral compass and a heart that determines what kind of person you are ?? That&#39;s just plain ignorance and when it comes to allowing myself to be in the company of ignorance, I find the door and make my hasty exit ! Give me a color crayon and color me Gone. That&#39;s the only time color matter&#39;s to me is when I&#39;m actually coloring. Go Figure 🤣🤣🤣; And I&#39;ve been told stuff like &quot;You look like a ghost, go get some tan&quot; and &quot;Are you sick?&quot; <br> We get shamed for our natural features whatever they are... We do our best to improve. Like, curl hair if it&#39;s straight and either tan or get our skin as pale as possible. And no matter how hard we try, people always judge. It&#39;s like... Those who say all this seem to struggle and hate themselves. <br> I&#39;m happy beauty standards are changing now. Humans are like flowers, we come in different shapes, sizes and colors. A plant needs sunlight, water, oxygen, minerals etc to bloom. Same here, ANYONE would look stunning if they nourish themselves; During the Victorian era it was the same as the rest of the world; Society: praise pale fair skin. <br>Also society: bully people with pale fair skin; I love my dark skin. I love other&#39;s dark skin. Pitch black dark skin is beautiful, brown skin is beautiful, pale skin is beautiful, albinism is beautiful, skin pigmentation is beautiful, coily hair is beautiful, IF YOU&#39;RE HEALTHY, YOU&#39;RE BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE MY HAIR, MY SKIN, AND THE WAY GOD MADE ME. I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.; Let&#39;s start putting these people on blast like we do with Karens. Family or not...they need to be exposed.; Hey Ibrahim, just wanna say your work is amazing. You talk about subjects that other creators may find too opinionated  or too unpopular to talk about and that&#39;s so good. I feel like subjects like this should be a much  more common thing to talk about. Keep up the good work❤❤🙏🏾🙏🏾✊🏾✊🏿✊🏽✊🏽✊🏼; I have seen very few &quot;libral&quot; with actual coherent though.; me getting called blackie since im 3yo bc my skin is a bit tanner than my sisters🥲; I remember when me and my friend decided to do a little prank. She decided to take a photo of us holding hands and posting it in a social media, just to clarify she wasn&#39;t have been dating recently, just in case someone thought this could be a harmfull prank. So  she is a tanned asian and I am white, so my skin tone was slightly lighter. People commented things like &quot;lol, he is whiter than you&quot;, disgusting comments. She didn&#39;t get really bothered,  but still harmfull and unnecesary comment.; I remember that I hated my skin tone. People that hated my would tell me that I look darker than my sister, which I don&#39;t. But even if I do, it doesn&#39;t matter.; What I find very interesting is that although white people might have the worst racism issues, they are trained to like darker skin on other white people. Looking tanned is considered pretty but that’s also the only shade you will ever notice. There’s extremely pale and you will immediately notice that and extremely tanned. Everything else is just white for white people. In Europe Race is less of a topic that’s constantly discussed and except for when it comes to black people i find that white people struggle to define any other skin colour because they can’t differentiate it as much. Features are the thing that shows that clearly the people have a different heritage but in many European languages the word brown for example isn’t used to describe skin tone. And the reason why that is is pretty obvious. Even a dark white person is still white as fuck. So you still get every last bit of white privilege no matter where you are on the spectrum. So you don’t have to think about colours as much. Personally I love different skin colours as much as different eye colours. Diversity is what makes a society look truly pretty and dark skin is always pretty. So screw anyone thinking differently!; in the middle of watching this video, i got a skin whitening ad. isnt that hilarious?; I feel like It&#39;s so backwards, because It&#39;s healthier to have more melanin, because it means you have higher resistance to sunlight. <br>where I live It is the opposite of what you are talking about. The darker a person&#39;s skin the more popular they are. As you can tell 😂 I&#39;m not very popular.; In Latino families, the members with the darkest skin never hear the end of it. I always knew it was wrong but I never spoke out against it or had a dialogue about it being wrong with the adults. Recently, my kids spent a summer in a much hotter climate without me. When I went to pick them up, my jaw dropped when I saw just how dark my son was. And before I even thought it out, I blurted out, &quot;No more sunlight for you!&quot; And deep down inside, I was a little jilted by just how dark he was. I kept thinking, &quot;He looks Indian!&quot; just like my great grandma would have said. And I felt terrible. I knew I was dead wrong for all of it. These ideas about what is good and bad are deeply ingrained. So I decided that I needed to do something very different so that my kids won&#39;t have such deeply ingrained biases and I started actively normalizing darkness in our home and sharing stories about how my family wrongfully believed whiteness was better because of our history with colonization. I went out of my way to buy dark skinned dolls for my toddler and watch movies and shows MADE BY AND FOR POC. It helps tremendously that our media has made leaps and bounds in the last few years otherwise the cycle with my kids would be a guaranteed repeat.; I&#39;m a white girl from Australia and the one thing I&#39;ve noticed colourism wise is that my Malaysian Indian friend has made comments like &#39;I wish my hair was more like yours&#39; or &#39;I don&#39;t like being in the sun too much in summer because my skin will get too dark. &#39;<br><br>I just find it bizarre when white people want to get a tan and those who are naturally darker wish they had lighter skin.; are you Indonesian or Malaysian?; People think colorism is perpetuated by white people...but I get more of it from those my own race...and it&#39;s not even close.; This intro scene reminded me of my aunt crying beacuse I was born with brown eyes instead of blue or green.; Huh, I&#39;m all watching this and you said what I did. I also think being pale or white hides a lot of problems, like when I&#39;m pale (I&#39;m olive so I can be kinda pale or dark depends on my time out really) all of my blemishes are less visible and my muscles look softer. But when I get tan you can see all of my blemishes, scars, marks, and muscles. So perhaps that may have something to do with it? I know I&#39;m kinda androgynous, and when I&#39;m pale I look more feminine, and tan I really legitimately do look masculine. I&#39;d send you photo proof if able.; Traditionally, a lot of the time, dark skin was automatically seen as you being poor, or a worker, and pale skin was related to wealth. I feel like that still effects today, though people do not realize it.; „Its not that all about looks” aslo dont be racist all races have insecurities; maybe because people in your culture are focused on vanity too much, it seems to be a weakness in your culture; as a black dude that grew up in Canada. i grew up in a mostly white neighborhood in edmonton and went to a mostly white school. i cannot understand how race is just casually tossed around and joked about in asia and africa. bringing up race was pretty taboo growing up. i feel like if someone insulted you because of your race, its a serious insult. the other person would probably get violent at that point. <br><br>i kind of also adopted that belief. even being asked my race/ethnicity is very offensive to me; If media promoted dark skin, this problem would decrease.; POC looking down on darker skin people are just letting white supremacy win. I hope they like licking the feet of white people. What im saying might be crass but hopefully it’ll wake them up to the reality of why they discriminate darker skin in the first place. <br><br>colorism in Asian countries is not just based on classism but also European colonization and racism. That’s why so many of them want mix white babies. To have whiter and more European looking kids. That’s also why some East Asians are still racist to pale southeast asian, it’s because they come from a country where majority of their people are darker skin tone. And also why so many Asian people are known to be more racists towards black people than white people. <br><br>So whoever says “colorism is still based from classism and they’re not trying to be racists”, is wrong.; Oh You Forgot To Say: &quot;And Black Hair&quot; Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!; I actually have a semi-tanned skin tone so I wasn&#39;t really made fun of too much, but my older brother has really light skin and people mistake him for being white even though we are both Mexican. One time, during a relative of mine&#39;s funeral, some of my dad&#39;s friends kept calling me &quot;morena&quot; (Spanish for dark-skinned) and calling my brother handsome and white. I tried asking them why are they comparing us. They just said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re beautiful just the way you are. We&#39;re just saying that since it&#39;s true.&quot; I just stared at them with a &quot;wtf&quot; face. My dad and brother calmed me down. And my brother kept staring at them as well. That was my first time ever being called dark-skinned. I hope I don&#39;t have any other encounters with that, but it might happen again. I don&#39;t know. ;-;; The kiiiids 😰😭💔; How Come you dont mention The Muslim Colonization they took over from Middle East all the way to Spain; Sine I was 7 years old, my uncles, cousins, aunties would literally bully my darkskin uncle. And over time I would believe that being dark was “undesirable” or “ugly” I don’t like how people normalized colorism 🗿👎🏽; cuz its ugly; I&#39;m a Siberian asian and I never had issues with my tan skin. I actually always wanted to be darker since it was sexy and my body looked slim and gorgeous with dark skin tone. I&#39;m fine if people prefer fair skin, but I hate when people say being tan is ugly. Man, have you seen Naomi Campbell, Holly Berry, Beyonce, Aishavariya Rai (miss Universe btw) and other black and tan supermodels??? I used to have korean and japanese care creams, but I dropped them because I looked too white and it doesn&#39;t look good. Yes, white skin can look ugly on some people! I&#39;m so annoyed of Asian trends of &quot;beauty&quot;. Those who blindly follows for majority look the same! No originality, no personality!; wow really!!! it looks like targeting Indians or precisely Hindus is the new normal, there is no discriminations on the bases of colour in our religion so plez just read about anything thoroughly before randomly putting any picture in your videos.........well! thought u were among the minority on youtube who talks facts but guess was wrong, after all copy paste-ing is a default setting; My Cuban mom has said that she doesn&#39;t like me being tan. My dad makes fun of my mom&#39;s hair because it&#39;s tight. And my brother shaved his head because of his curls. The thing is we&#39;re literally mostly Iberian.; I def think ppl Cherry pick light skinned black ppl when they wanna show diversity.<br>And I love what’s coast in your intro😭; I have white skin. I mean...white like snow. And it&#39;s not cool at all, because it means my body have huge health problems, it means I can&#39;t stay outside without feel pain(even with sunscreen). There is no beauty in being pale if it hurts you. But there is a beauty in being healthy, happy and confident, no matter what your skin shade is. <br> As long as you stay healthy and do things you like, you are beautiful. <br> <br> Sorry, English is not my native language; This world is so f***ed up! Dark people want to be white and white people tan to be dark lol!"
"Race Change, Pale Skin &amp; The Asian Doll Industry",dollvee,2024-03-09T22:52:46Z,"What is ""The Race Change Community""? And do we need to celebrate diversity more in the Asian Doll Community and Asian ...",qOkeMv-Kndk,"I personally find the race changing thing to be cringe and a little offensive. People can admire and respect aspects of a culture without trying physically be a part of it. I only have like 3 bjds, but I have brown skin myself and often seek out brown skinned dolls in general. I&#39;ve come across a few bjd brands that offer brown and dark brown shades, 2 of my dolls are from Iplehouse, and I&#39;m glad those options exist at all even though they cost more.; Im really happy to see someone talk about this. ❤; egyptians didnt do skin whitening but were obsessed with beauty rituals. they are very much representing themselves as in their dark skin in their art. Ma&#39;at had black skin to represent the night sky, osiris was green... - when did everything change in favor of paleness. <br>Doubly interesting is that Japan and Korea, are really into Egypt as an aesthetic like Yu-Gi-Oh and that web comic about the Egyptian gods - but with heavy &quot;white&quot; washing.<br><br>To add. During &quot;AAPI&quot; month this year, the google play store actually had a picture of mostly dark skinned Asians when representing &quot;struggle&quot; and adversity but Asians, especially online, are pushing to be acknowledged as just genetic sisters of europeans. They used darker skin to display social struggles but not commercial success or acceptance.; forgot to dislike so I&#39;m back<br>lmk when you can afford some YSL; Those glasses aren&#39;t Tom Ford<br>opinion discarded; I&#39;m just going back to making custom pullips and realized that the &quot;natural&quot; skintone, which is the lightest realistic skintone, is currently sold out. It is nice that the pullip doll kits include a &quot;mocha&quot; option tho. As a Filipino doll collector, it&#39;s nice to have a lot that has similar skin. But, that&#39;s the darkest it gets, and when I actually started using the Mocha kits, they aren&#39;t dark enough for more variety. The eye shape also seems perfect for southeast Asian just because they are similar to Asian eye shape, but round. I find the pullips feel a little bit more Asian looking than other options which do look very eurocentric beauty standards.<br><br>Also, poor Lisa must have gotten bullied and pressured into so much plastic surgery to become acceptable to Koreans, and still she gets a lot of hate.; As a black doll collector this is such an interesting take! It is very disheartening when I see only pale bjds but I’ve kinda gotten used to it lol. Fashion dolls are cheaper and more diverse nowadays so I go for them more!; Very great video! I&#39;ve never heard of the rcta community! Very scary stuff to see young people trying to brainwash themselves. It reminds me a bit of the shifting community, where they&#39;d try and mental transport themselves into fiction worlds like Hogwarts.<br><br>I&#39;m suprised you didn&#39;t mention the language used to describe bjd skin tones! Most Japanese, Korean, or Chinese bjd makers will have at least one resin color labeled as &quot;normal.&quot; And, unsurprisingly, normal is just a sliver less pale than white.<br><br>As a bjd collector, I&#39;m always frustrated by the difficulty of finding diverse skintones in the style of doll I like. I gravitate towards cute, big-eyed dolls, but its these very dolls that typical only come in &quot;white&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; options. You tend to see a range of brown skintones available with doll companies that make large scale, mature looking dolls, like Iplehouse or Impledoll. I appreciate that Luts offers cute sculpts in a range of brown tones outside of limited-time offers.; Also id love if you made a video about your own experience with plastic surgery, you seem to have a very healthy approach to it and I&#39;m just so interested in that.; I&#39;m 24 and Caucasian, and I always liked cosplay and doll makeup and watched YouTubers like Venus Angelic and so on. But I was also heavily inspired by harajuku fashion and kawaii fashion. The dolls that I collect are all pale, like I have a few dollfies in flesh skin and I also collect pullips and azones. To be honest I like dolls that I can bond with and I like dolls where I can see a bit of myself in them, so therefore I never really wanted to collect dark skinned dolls, even though I think that so many of them are stunning. I really like the Pullip Nana-Chan or Smart dolls in tea, but I probably will never get them because I wouldn&#39;t bond with them so much. Does that make sense?; Great video. Lots to think about. 🤍; This was a great video ❤I’d love to see you go even deeper into with topic specifically focusing on dolls more; This reminds me of a company I actually like called TBLeague (formerly Phicen) that makes 1/6 scale silicone dolls usually bought by collectors to make custom characters. In the past, their colors and designs were very limited. It was all white or pale colors of varying degrees, and there was only one black skin type and it was only female, so it was impossible to create more darker skinned characters. Their body types were also very limited, usually ranging from athletic to super macho Arnold Schwarzenegger style. Collectors voiced their opinion to the company to make more body types and colors and later on, they did listen to the customers and added a variety of skin tones and body types. Nowadays, they have more darker skinned options as well as more body types ranging from slim to chubby to athletic and superhero. <br><br>There&#39;s one hilarious thing that happened with TBLeague where they got called out for laziness though. I think it was a year or two ago when they were offering this special &quot;original&quot; Cleopatra character complete with Egyptian costumes and accessories. They offered her in two skin tones, pale and black. The problem was that the black Cleopatra was simply a repaint, as in it still had the Caucasian facial structure! People pointed out that that&#39;s not how black people looked and so TBLeague was forced to scrap the black Cleopatra since they didn&#39;t have time to make a new head sculpt for the black version.<br><br>As for that race change issue, here in the US, it reminds me of this former politician named Rachel Dolezal. She claimed to be black even though she&#39;s a white person. Another person that reminds me of race change is actually from the Philippines, he&#39;s a guy who&#39;s had countless surgeries to look like Superman! I just googled his name and it&#39;s Herbert Clark Manalo Chavez. There was a documentary on him because he has the largest Superman collection in the world.<br><br>Although I don&#39;t believe there is anything wrong with pursuing certain beauty standards because I believe in the freedom of a person to do as they please with their body, when it comes to changing something that&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; with you that is by nature something cannot be changed without the help of medical science, such as your race, then that really is concerning as it implies there&#39;s an underlying reason as to why the person isn&#39;t happy or comfortable in their own natural physical racial look. Why is this person willing to go so far to transform into another race? Why are they so willing to spend so much money and undergo risky operations just to have certain looks not usually found in their racial group? What kind of self-image problems does this person have? If they actually change themselves to look like they&#39;re from a different racial group, will they actually be happy, or is this just some kind of band-aid over a more serious problem, such as mental illness? Even if the cause is their local culture or society telling them &quot;Whiter, fairer skin is more beautiful&quot;, why would they actually force themselves to take risks and get surgery and not just simply say &quot;NO&quot; to them if they&#39;re not comfortable with it? This isn&#39;t something as innocent and harmless as enjoying music, clothes, or activities from another racial group, like how in Asia, like the Philippines, a lot of youngsters love rap music and try to become rappers and they dress up like them, or how in South Korea, Japan, and China, classical music is something that a lot of people love and many musicians try to become professional musicians for.<br><br>Making permanent changes to one&#39;s body is not a joke, it&#39;s something that is very serious and I believe this requires a deeper inspection, probably with the help of a psychologist or someone who can dig deep into a person&#39;s mind and figure out if there&#39;s something very unhealthy going on in there.<br><br>As for dolls or toys not always having diverse color options, it&#39;s not really something that bothers me. Whether it&#39;s toys or tv/movie characters, I can still relate to people who are from different races than me, people who look very different from me. Color, body type, or race isn&#39;t really a factor for me when it comes to whether I would like or be able to &quot;connect&quot; with a character or not. What matters to me is, &quot;Is this character interesting? Is this character relatable? What kind of moral values/principles does this character have? Is this toy/doll good quality? Does this toy/doll have good design?&quot; Of course it would be nice to have more variety, especially for people who enjoy creating custom characters. The more options, the better, but ultimately, I simply enjoy them for who they are no matter their race or body type.<br><br>Anyway, this was a very interesting topic, since I originally clicked on it because I was curious about dolls.; This is so so intriguing. <br><br> As a black person and life long doll collector AND as a person that’s always enjoyed so many facets of the Asian cultures… I’d say unfortunately I’m not all that surprised to learn of this. It feels like the digital age expressing what what was already being enforced but not publicly or perhaps not internationally. <br><br>Growing up I had a few friends, all of them Asian except 1. Both my Asian friends came from different cultures. One Chinese and the other Filipino… both of them would get lightly scolded for being out in the Floridian sun with out some kind of sun protection… and not for fear of sunburning, their parents just didn’t want them to get darker… I didn’t understand it because I’m very dark and wouldn’t really understand colorism till much later in life… I say all this to say I get why people may feel the way they do about their identities. Sometimes it feels like a real answer to your pain to just… be someone else. Even if that means destroying who you are… <br><br>I think we have to take the time to realize and unpack that beauty isn’t and really hasn’t ever been singular. There are just as many valid ways to be beautiful as there are human beings. In my collection I have a VAST amount of diversity because that’s my favorite kind of beauty standard. Being able to see the love and care in every kind of person is divine. Collecting this way has opened my own eyes in many ways. But I will say I don’t think I would have ever been able to enjoy others and lift them up as well until I loved all of me. <br><br>To anyone reading this, you are beautiful. Just the way you are. ❤; Good message. Thanks; I&#39;m so happy you have made this video. I have noticed this trend on social media and the desire to change and look like / be someone else is sadly the message that is being pushed to those whom are influenced more than the message of loving oneself in your entirety no matter how you were born.; A lot of the language used regarding &quot;Transracial&quot; or Race Change to Another is used to mock the transgender community. Transgender communities have existed for a long time and many cultures have histories regarding gender variance and sexual identities, when Rachel Dolezal was discovered to be a White woman pretending to be a Black woman as the former President of the NAACP chapter back in 2015. I noticed a huge uptick in such behaviors, even with other aspects such as a person&#39;s age or body type."

They took the boats an traverse the lands to the West. They landed on each area including Europe which they named Europa.; Thank you for creating this video. I spent a year in China studying abroad during college and although they knew I was not white, because of my complexion, they assumed I was Lebanese- not black, but something closer to home that they could identify with. When I realized that everyone around me had mistaken my ethnicity, I tried to go online to show our rainbow, but the images were all BLOCKED! Here&#39;s what most ppl in America do not know, where we are controlled with chaos, their population is controlled through suppressed information (even within their own nation).

I&#39;m super light white, but always preferred the dark skin races.; I believe that all 3 of Noah’s Sons were black, Ham, Shem and Japheth. And whites (seed of the fallen watchers mostly but not all) mostly occupied the mountain areas of the “Middle East”, and also the caucuses (3 mount seir’s) and wherever these whites went they had to conquer because they had no land of their own traditionally. Race was not viewed the same as today. People were designated according to their tribe.<br>I’m suggesting that black peoples didn’t only come from Africa. The earth was divided by the 3 black tribal descendants of Noah’s sons.; The origins of Asians can be traced back to the early human migrations out of Africa. It is believed that modern humans first emerged in Africa around 200,000 years ago. Over time, some groups of humans began to migrate out of Africa and spread across different parts of the world, including Asia; It is important to note that Asia is a vast continent with a rich diversity of ethnicities and cultures. The term &quot;Asian&quot; encompasses a wide range of people from different regions such as East Asia (China, Japan, Korea), Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan), and West Asia (Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia). Each region has its own unique history and migration patterns that have contributed to the formation of Asian populations; I am a dark skin Asian from SE Asia and I love my dark skin.  Half of my family are either dark complexion or light.; Were they african slaves who were prostituted by China from the damned British Empire?; Nah; Bro. Them pale skin that call themselves Asians are really Orientals, and we all didn&#39;t came from Africa, and we brown folks all over was already here on our lands, and truly us brown folks are the only beautiful beings on our planet and not the rest of these humans.; THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER MADE; You do realize that the first humans in Africa were pale skinned, right? And I&#39;m not saying this to get a rise out of you or to claim that white people are superior in any way. I&#39;m just stating it because it&#39;s a fact. White skin came first in human beings... 900,000 years ago there were seven different light and pale skin varients and pigmentstions within what is now known as Africa. There were no black people. And that&#39;s because the planet was locked in an Ice Age for almost the entire time humans have been walking this Earth. Dark skin did not appear until the Ice Age began to dissipate slightly about 200,000 years ago. But even then it was still too cold and the UV rays were not penetrating enough to cause the type of darker skin tones that most consider &quot;Black&quot; today. That type of melanin was not needed in the skin until about ten to twenty thousand years ago when the Ice Age came to its full end, and that was only near the equatorial regions of Africa and portions of Oceania and what is now known as Australia. But those people evolved differently than Africans. So you&#39;re not the same. The DNA is even different. But even northern Africa would have been covered in snow for a decent portion of the year during the Ice Age time period from around 2.2Million years ago until about twenty thousand years ago. So trying to claim that all of these other peoples around the world were once black is nothing but a politically motivated mythology created by Afrocentrists and those who think they can gain by making you all believe in this.<br><br>Anyhow, if you don&#39;t believe me then you can easily go look it up. Just type &quot;Pale Skin Africans 900,000 Years Ago&quot;, and you will see many articles explaining this. Asians were never black, and neither were Europeans or Native Americans. Wherever you&#39;re getting your evidence from (if that&#39;s what you can call it) it&#39;s no good. It&#39;s faulty work and it&#39;s being spread for manipulative purposes. And while you might think it&#39;s good now, in the end it&#39;s only being used to hurt your people and confuse you. And sadly, it&#39;s working in some cases. And you should also stop trying to relate to everyone who has a little bit of a tan as &quot;People Of Color&quot;. Everyone has a little color to their skin, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re related to you or your race of people. As a matter of fact most Asians are closely related to Europeans and vice versa. But black Africans are almost a race of their own due to the fact that they never really left the Continent. They had no need to.<br><br>I think you forget why humans migrate in the first place. It&#39;s to find food and shelter. This is why Asians and Europeans explored so much. It was because they had to and not because they wanted to. The continents were covered in ice or had such harsh weather that they were forced at certain times to relocate. Africans on the other hand did not have this problem. Neither did Native Americans once they got to North and South America.; Stop trying to paint the world black. It just makes you look sad, as if your inferior to others and covet everything you see in other races and cultures. It&#39;s one thing to want to move there or live there, or maybe even colonize or conquer certain areas. But to come in through the back door and actually try to subvert or change their history and claim it as your own is quite pathetic.; People don&#39;t even know how black and white film works, as can be seen by the thumbnail of this video.😂... That guy ain&#39;t black. His skin is just oily and in black and white film it shows up dark. But in person he would have looked no different than modern Asians.

Early cameras were made for white people, other races, especially Asians came out very dark in the pictures. Don’t believe me? Look it up, google is free.; All humans come from Africa. There are people of all skin tone in Asia. I&#39;m very offended, however, that the author of this video ignorantly and obviously from a very racist and hateful thought, by saying that Chinese, Korean, Filipino, and Japanese people dont want to know that we&#39;re related to Africans. This is absolute BS. We believe the truth. We all come from Africa. We&#39;re not racists. We don&#39;t hate Africans or people with darker skin tone. Stop spreading false and racist stereotypes that Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Filipino people hate Africans.; We wuz kangz; Chinese people tan really dark from the sun and most of these people are farmers or work out in the sun that could be 1 of the reasons they so dark; Dude don’t lie they are not black. The camera quality was bad. And they didn’t have curly hair. How come a 25% black person has curly hair but this dark brown Asian with black features still has straight hair? ITS NOT BLACK; Great video. Thank you!; Very enlightening video, thank for expanding our knowledge bank. 😊; No; I don&#39;t believe this; Were there dark skin in Europe; Yeah uh no; Thanks ! I need the puzzle 🧩 too see we’re it came from !! In Mississippi they called it Asiatic so the they hide me !! But now I see !! Check me out ! There are my family all those in those pictures thanks a lot !; Deep Truth!; I was shocked. I watched your earlier videos. I believe you now. I am in U.S., but I am from China. I have been in Japan and Korean. I believe you are right that your finding entails global meanings, in addition to the already broad, deep, and grand implications on U.S..       now, on the global front, those 3 north eastern nations are the “problem” ones: the general population has a deep rooted strong bias preferring light complexion. However, they are so lucky that they did not fall into the racist trap like U.S. did after around 1900.   U.S. is, no matter how we are disappointed, the lighthouse of the world, yet it has this in its closet, unbelievable!      This truth should educate the population in those 3 northeastern nations a bit deal.     We really need to educate people in those 3 nations. Although U.S. population goes deeper and more harmful, but those 3 nations are more broad and hurtful 😂 — they need to be educated and changed.      But I believe the traditional fair-complexion-preference comes from ruling class has less outdoor labor work (Perhaps I am wrong). As a result, it is easy to turn the tide nowadays since tan is well-known healthier.; im black and all my life ive never heard anyone other than my people called black.  No african have been mistakenly called black.  There are STILL dark skinned asians but stop confusing pweople to make it seem they were my people , which you call black people.<br>or<br> you must be confused, sir.  <br>also do you not know where India is...?  SMH   idk the propaganda but no wonder these youngin are so dumb, street and bookwise.; I think they were red; It&#39;s obvious humankind started from Africa so our ancestors were from Africa; Are you saying all people aspire to be white, and insinuating there is a accepted view that white people are superior under the guise of scientific/documentarian video in a popular medium?; Thank you; Western Academia in general and anthropology in particular has had a very racist past. That being said, the most recent sciences still place the main waves of human migration from Africa to East Asia at 60,000 years ago at the latest. The Andaman Islanders having been isolated for most of that time, are the darkest complected people outside of Africa. From India through Southeast Asia ,there have been waves of migration ever since that time. India has shrinking populations of Adivasi people and Southeast Asia has dwindling populations of “Negrito” people, to use the term from ethnographers of mid-20th century some of us older people might remember. These people groups also still have a lot of the “old African” admixture however the waves of migrants from North Eurasia over the millennia have left them surrounded people of every shade. These waves not only swept through Southeast Asia but north into China Japan and Korea. And in addition these migrations, ancient Africans also split off from the coastal group and went north into central Asia and Siberia losing their melanin and eventually becoming very pale Europeans and Northeast Asians. Not all the Northeast Asians stayed in those high latitudes. Some kept going until they had to turn south to Korea, Japan and China. Essentially pale people moving clockwise and dark people going counter-clockwise, mixing every step of the way. Genetics bears this out. Northerners with varying degrees of admixture from southerners and southerners with varying degrees of northern admixture. Added to this most recently are cultural attitudes from upper classes about darker complected manual laborers and the culture destroying effects of colonialism. And finally in the last century we have seen the trend of vast segments of society leaving agriculture and manual labor and moving to cities. Suffice it to say, there are a few variables at play here.; We are all from one place.  Africa; hmm.. as far as i know, the women who painted their face actually related to prostitution not noble back then. especially in Japan, these women are called Geisha. they had to painted their face white so the customer can see their appearance better in the dark hence the guy usually crawling to them when&#39;s it&#39;s start to dark. remind this occasional was long time ago when there was no electricity and only oil lamp to brighten up the place. so when the guy always murmur says those white appearance related to those beauty in the red street, gradually many women start to obsessed to cast their face becoming white. i&#39;m not saying this video is totally wrong, but our ancestors migrate and their path are anywhere, there are possibility; having the standard of pale skin came from white supremacy not considering whiteness as beauty that wouldn&#39;t make any sense for the simple fact most Asains in ancient times were brown or dark complected. its no coincidence, most places around the world non European see the high so called beauty standard as white.; I already knew that Philippine had black/dark skinned people and other Asian countries. It’s sad that people regardless of race don’t have pride in their heritage. North East Africans don’t bleach their skin like the rest of Africa. So interesting to see skin bleaching is a big thing in Asia. People have been mixing since the beginning of time for many reasons, there aren&#39;t that many pure races.; Why is this important that a BM would make a video about THIS? Wyte Daddy already told you everyone originated from Africa…🤦🏿‍♂️; This video is racial nihilism. This YouTuber took out the photo last century which the photography techniques just begin, people at that time seems darker no matter it’s Asian or European. If you look back the painting work through the past thousands of years, Asian are always fair skinned when there is no Westerners influence. The reason why Asians in the photo seems darker also because they are malnourished. I’m a Chinese, my grandfather’s grandfather and grandmother was also fair skinned in the photos.; This makes me sad. Seems like there really is an agenda ongoing to erase dark skinned people... to see whole countries of people who were dark skinned now be so light skinned they barely rememble their ancestors. And seems so counter productive since they are breeding out the very thing that keeps the sun from burning them alive. Its like the want to become incompatible with living on earth.; My husband&#39;s feom bamgladesh &amp; he&#39;s black.

How Do We BENEFIT From This Great Pretend Game? <br><br>We versus THEM? Pretending that people are opposites of each other = CASTE SYSTEM<br><br>Just think, this is 2024, and we continue to allow ourselves to be brainwashed, and using this primitive concept, to call ourselves and others, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white,&quot; when neither are actually those colors. It&#39;s all make believe to create divides and peg people against each other. It&#39;s NO coincidence that Europeans or European Americans are so-called, &quot;white&quot; and Africans, or African Americans, have to pretend to be, so-called, &quot;black.&quot; There is &quot;ZERO SCIENCE INVOLVED&quot; and clearly not based on actual appearance. The European wealthy rulers created the concept for their benefit. It&#39;s brainwashing, it&#39;s a delusion. It&#39;s primitive nonsense. It&#39;s a mind control trick, a hallucination. Divide and conquer. <br><br>&quot;You do not win by struggling to the top of a caste system.

You are quite light.; Embolism and sepsis are adverse effects of any IV in an  unsafe practice. It has nothing to do specifically with glutathione iv.

As a mixed Hawaiian and Irish person- my mom would scold me if I stayed out in the sun because she’d say that I’d get too dark. Getting these kinds of messages- that dark is bad or not pretty- is damaging and I think it would be better for the mental health of all people of color if we were able to let go of this idea that lighter is better. It’s still something I struggle with to this day-will be glad when I’m rid of it.; It&#39;s interesting because skin tightening is generally feared and looked down upon in my country, the clinics that are offering this service claim it&#39;s for evening out and toning the skin.; Personally, I like the skin I&#39;m in. I want to lighten the dark areas around my feet. Since being diagnosed with diabetes my skin around my feet has gotten darker than the rest of my body. Can this ingredient you&#39;re speaking of help with just that problem area?

Oral glutatione?; Hey Dr. V, I am a man and I want to remove some dark spots on my beard area, what glutathione product would you recommend for you my problem?; I think one thing that makes us lighter genetically is our eyes . Caucasians see themselves lighter from their blue eyes and fair eyes . <br> Even though they are born light skin but the main reason why they cant become dark is their eyes that see themselves lighter . They dont see themselves like other darker skin races see themselves . <br>As it says in the bible as your eyesare full of light so is your body .; With <b>WhiteOnCream</b> my journey to achieving milky white skin has become a reality. It&#39;s a game-changer! 🙌❤; I have glutathione capsules 1000mg<br>I dont ever swallow them. What I do is take two capsule and mix the powder with my skin lightening creams. Yes it does work.<br>It prevents the skin from having cracks from my lightening creams and evens my face. It makes my skin glow.; Your thumbnail picture was so cringe for the title no hate lol; One sad thing about propaganda using fair skin people (not all fair people are &quot;caucasian&quot;) is that it was designed to cause division even way back then. Today it is being used to cause people of color to hate fair skinned/causian people when most fair skinned/caucasian people were not in power. A &quot;select few&quot; propagandized all of the skin tones, including fair skinned/ caicasian people. We are all survivors of that evil plan. So many are blinded by it though, by their own position of the plan to divide and &quot;get even&quot;. That&#39;s why division is not only thriving, but is even worse than it use to be. Such hatred, revenge, and division has been fed to the masses. Unity won&#39;t come like that. <br><br>I realize your channel is about skin care for people of color. You mentioned early on in your video, that people of color believed that fair skin was better  because of the messages from the media, etc. That has been damaging to every race. They propagandized fair skinned/caucasian people as well at the same time. But Caucasians are not seen as survivors of an evil brain washing. We are all surviving what they have done to mankind in general. Anything less than grace, forgiveness,  and mercy, will be a wall against unity. Unity is where we people (mankind) will find our power as well as our peace. <br><br>Looks like you&#39;re doing great work for skin! Keep up the  good work doctor. Have a great day 🙂; Just don&#39;t take it!!!!!🤨; 🥹Very interesting, thanks. But, sorry I got quite distracted by you continuing moving HANDS... too many hands!!!; which pill is better to get a whitener skin?; Can u please suggest some glutathionine tablets that works?; Hello Dr Rattan, At 5.54 you mention that you looked more toned when you were darker. Does it mean that your skin has become lighter in the years that followed and may I know how you lightened your skin. Thank you !; Dr Vanita Rattan- I have a question for you, Why do you use Glutathione for skin whitening yet make videos like this pretending that you don’t use it? As a dermatologist looking at your videos from 7 years ago to this video, I can quite confidently say you very likely use glutathione or something similar for skin whitening? Why do you want to whiten your skin?; I have been taking glutathiaone and Vitamin C supplements for a bout a month. My skin looks amazing. Its soft, supple, Im not &quot;lighter&quot; but my skin seems to be evening out , I had mild hyperpigmentation here and there, I was using it for anti aging not &quot;skin lightening&quot; . Ive noticed the dark circles under my eyes becoming lighter (not gone) . Glutathione is 100% safe for people with pigmented skin. I found a video Dr Mark HYman made on youtube 15 years ago calling Glutathione teh &quot;mother&quot; of all anti oxidants. Everyone should be taking it.; This is a very good information 👍 thank you; I can&#39;t believe how fast <b>Whiteoncream</b> worked! I now have permanent white skin that looks amazing ❤😍; What about the injections in the face; Cysteamine??; What is with these scare tactics? Sepsis, Embolism? You&#39;re talking about the dangers of generic IV usage in  unregulated clinics. This is distinct from Glutathione as a substance. You&#39;ve got your camera setup to look lighter and then start to talk about how you don&#39;t support skin lightening. We all need to grow up.; My doctor told me to stop taking it immediately. My liver enzymes were off the chart.  She says that the supplements aren&#39;t regulated. 😮; What about rectal use ?; You do look much lighter compared to 7y ago, i could barely recognize you 🤔 not talking about the interventions you clearly had but your skin is much lighter and bright; Not because I want &quot;lighter&quot; Skin...... I have extreme uneven skin tone.... I feel so embarrassed seriously.. Face neck, knees, elbows, arms are way more dark brown shade and other parts are much lighter..... I had enough of this.; Very good information, by the way which country you are from?; Just watch the video for the lip bite u did; 12 seconds in, she resembles a latina, has an Indian name, with a British accent, and she&#39;s a doctor.. What else? 😍; Whites likes to tan and turn brown, Browns use cometics and like to turn light ...We all want what we don&#39;t have ..So what&#39;s the big deal.; I have heard through research that this is good for cataracts can u please touch on this; WHO HAS BLACK SKIN DR STUPID; My doctor put me on glutaryl to increase my glutathione but now I’m wondering if it will weirdly lighten my skin; I use it for skin allergy conditions of the skin; I would never advocate for skin lightening. God made us beautiful the way we are all different colors, but they do use NAC to treat many lung condition as well as Tylenol overdose.; funny/sad how outrageously beneficial Glutathione is, yet this is one of the 3 videos that pops up on a one word search of this medicine.; I consume gluta for my fatty liver; I just want my original skin color back. I had a lot of acne in my teenage and Since then it gets darker frequently if I don’t maintain it well.; It&#39;s odd how you frame yourself as a doctor when you aren&#39;t a practicing physician based on what is posted online. It&#39;s misleading.; I&#39;m a men my skin is  brown skin I want full body whitening brightening skin plz good suggests me doctor; That&#39;s why I only take the oral supplementation of glutathione.; i have heard as  glutathione injection reduce melanine from body, it  can cause vitiligo disease, is it true?; I had no idea it lightened your skin....I take it for liver health but never noticed my skin being any lighter; Maam what is the safe percentage of using topical glutathione? 2/3%; I don’t know why some people think of white skin colour is beautiful. For me growing in a white environment I feel like it’s too white like a paper. So myself being asian yellowish col, to me black and shiny colour is the coolest!; Question can Glutathione treat Acanthosis Nicagrian dark spots?"

I&#39;m applying sunscreen to my face. The question is if I wipe my face because of the sweat, can the sunscreen I applied be removed? Thanks; really appreciate you including parts to show what it looks like on darker skin; Mineral sunscreen is the bane of my skincare routine.; I&#39;m very light skinned naturally and the supergoop miniral screen left a very noticable white cast as well as pilled on me over maybe my moisturizer just fyi to anybody that was interested.. for THAT price and mini travel container..it&#39;s a NO fer me. 👋🏼🥱; I might definitely try out the matte screen now. I was hesitant because I&#39;m dry already but need mineral SPF due to sensitivities.; These are all pricey products. The Australian Gold also contains eucalyptus, which can be irritating for some. Cassandra has an updated list with drugstore options that are vegan and cruelty free. Hyram does also, but he includes less than conscious corporate brands.; If you look at the active ingredients in the Australian Gold sunscreen, it can&#39;t possibly be SPF 50. 4% is very low protection for zinc &amp; titanium dioxide. EWG says the same thing...&quot;Based on EWG&#39;s modeling, the UV protection is significantly lower than the SPF value would indicate.&quot; I used to love this product, but kept noticing that my nose would get red (aka burned).; Would loove a 2021 version of this video! Thank you so much for your thorough and informative vids 💗🥺; Are the products mask proof/ transfer proof?; What do you think about the ordinary mineral spf 30?; Do I need to double cleanse to remove sunscreen?; This is so lovely!; Thanks for the video:) I wish you included more comments about the UVA protection and the strenghth of the formula, cause that is what sunscreen is for - to protect,  and not only how it applies on the skin. Personally I have been using Australian Gold SPf 50 and even though it feels so light on the skin , only above 4 percent of zink oxide and titanium dioxide is reallt not enough protection, especially from UVA. I dont understand how they got approved with spf 50 but they will definately get a low level of PA rating.; all those sunscreen are expensive, cant afford it ):; I&#39;m poor; Thank you; Do you find any harmful ingredients in this list dear?<br>Water, Homosalate, Dipropylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Silica, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, CetearylOlivate, Octocrylene, SorbitanOlivate, Polysorbate 60, Polyacrylate-13, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Stearate, Polyisobutene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Flavor, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysorbate 20, SorbitanIsostearate, Butylene Glycol, CentellaAsiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Ganoderma Lucidum (Mushroom) Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Ethanol, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Magnolia Liliflora Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract), Cinnamomum Zeylanicum Bark Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract; You are a licensed dermatologist why would you care if it&#39;s approved by Hyram?; are these sunscreens really that worth it for these prices? the supergoop is SGD 51 for just 45ml! that&#39;s so incredibly expensive for a product that supposed to be applied throughout the day :&#39;( edit: looks like i&#39;ll be picking up the Dr. G sunscreen because it checks out almost all the things I&#39;m looking for!; I just tried the All Good tinted sunscreen and wow, definitely the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried. I am light-medium skin toned with yellow-olive undertone and the tint is absolutely perfect. I can&#39;t believe a mineral sunscreen can be this good. It makes me wonder if the spf 30 is true or not.; Is it just me? The supergoop mattescreen makes my skin very dry :(…. I really want to know which sunscreen works for dry skin.; *_Am final a mother today , because of fibroids my tubes was block for 6years I and my husband was having issue because of my situation no child when I was Searching online on YouTube about fibroids I saw a testimony about him so I write him and place order for his herbal today I have 2weeks old baby now he can help you too Herb&#39;s work like magic..; Did the dr g mild sun up lotion pass the spf test??? @liah; You guys If you&#39;re into only mineral spfs should seriously try the ARC SUNCARE mineral spf 50, it&#39;s fragrance free, alcohol free and non Nano zinc. Its the least white castey Mineral suncreen i&#39;ve ever tried hands down. I have perioral Dermatitis and very sensitive skin and this is my holy Grail and I really tested 100+ mineral suncreens over the years. They do ship wordwide. Its really a Game changer for me so since its small european brand you might check it Out! Much Love from Germany ♥️; Hey! Does anyone out there know of any good daily moisturizers that are: High in SPF (50); Mineral SPF, oily/acne-prone skin friendly, Coral Reef friendly, vegan, has antioxidants, that won&#39;t leave a damn white cast on your skin? I know this sounds soo specific, but I&#39;ve been searching the face of the earth looking for a daily moisturizer that checks off everything on this list lol. Thanks!; Black people have a SPF factor of up to 13. usually 10 from statistics. Spf 15 allows 150 minutes before burning and filters 95% of sunrays. Black people tend to not need SPF unless going outdoors for prolong periods hence the market for black people sunscreen is lesser. But its nice to see inclusiveness to cater to everyone.; Purito and Dear Klairs?? Really??? Lmfaoooo; Omg! You are so pretty, girl! Thanks for sharing your Best Mineral Sunscreens you&#39;ve tried. This is really helpful indeed. I really enjoyed watching it. More like this, please! Hope we can connect with each other. Sending love from Angela Kim!💗; Love love love the multiple skin tones!  Thank you!!!!🥰😍🥰😍; it&#39;s weird but I don&#39;t trust the purito one, like it&#39;s so perfect I wonder how they manage to have this amazing texture with no cast but still be really protective; Liah, first of all, I love you and thanks for sharing so much with us! I want to leave you a suggestion if that&#39;s ok. How about including 2 more spaces on the detailing guide in these videos, &quot;vegan-friendly&quot; and &quot;cruelty-free&quot;? I&#39;m vegan and that would be super helpful! <br><br>I hope you see this, even though I guess you won&#39;t hahahaha; Is it suitable for dry sensitive skin? Mineral sunscreen gives me extremely dry and  ichy skin !!; I would like to suggest a sunscreen that I’ve used on my face. It’s Alba Botanica Hawaiian Sunscreen. It’s reef friendly, recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation, doesn’t make me break out, NO animal testing, no gluten, no artificial colors, no synthetic fragrances, no parabens, no pthalates, no sulfates, and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin (I’m naturally a medium tan ~ American Indian). I hope this helps.; The Australian gold one is awesome and has different SHADES for different people; Nice; Actually I’m looking for a good sunscreen WITH white cast lol; The all good tinted sunscreen looks promising.; I just wish some mineral suncreens have balanced ingredients that doesn&#39;t make ur skin dry yet hydrating; Do u think avene is a good brand for sunscreen?

Have you every tried  colorscience sun forgettable spf 50 and dermatology universal Tinted spf 46  ? What do you think of the formulation ?

I&#39;ve realised after using biore aqua rich sunscreen, my skin looks darker.; The mild up sunscreen links the to the cream and not the lotion, hard time finding it :(; Make a video about innisfree products!!! Pleasee; THANK YOU so much for including swatches on darker skin, this is the first video I&#39;ve found that covers a variety of sunscreens and how they work on dark skin (that aren&#39;t the typical ones people use for darker skin).

It would be nice to see how it looks on skin that is lighter hue for black people. Also, where are the men? :-P I have the Versed one myself.; Liah, did the Supergoop Matte sunscreen leave any slight residue on your fingers as you applied it? I don&#39;t have much experience with mineral sunscreens, especially tinted ones, so when that one gave me some residue I had to wash off, I wondered if that was normal...; I am such a fan and really appreciate you! Keep doing what you are doing.; Super late so you probably won&#39;t see this, but I was under the impression that Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Face Sunscreen SPF 50 is not broad spectrum. Check out the percentages of active ingredients. I could be wrong, but I recall another skintuber saying you should use another sunscreen as well to get proper spf protection; Hi Lian yoo, thanks for reviewing these sunscreen. Can u also review on a Japanese Sunscreen brand NOV Sunscreen spf 32?; Hey liah!<br>I&#39;m interested to try Supergoop Matte sunscreen, but I&#39;ve tried australian gold one and that&#39;s too drying and the tint are look too white for my skin. When you said that Australian gold one could be a dupe for Supergoop matte, is it have the same kind of &quot;dryness&quot; and &quot;color finish&quot;? Thank you!; I don&#39;t think I actually saw products that didn&#39;t have a white cast?; Purito made me sick for 3 days. Be careful.; Sht, can&#39;t afford it. Mine is from Bali Breeze spf50+ pa++++ and it cost around 10$ for a 100ml.; Thank you for this video. Very informative and complete. I just want to mentio that you need to wait at least 2 minutes for the sunscreen to setttle before making a judgement, otherwise you won&#39;t know how the sunscreen truly performs. Sometimes the white cast goes away as the formula does its thing and absorbs and forms the sun-protective layer :); Hi Liah, thank you for your review. Can u review more on mineral sunscreen that has glowy, dewy effect?; What skin type are you?; Who&#39;s here after Purito&#39;s Sunscreen Scandal?; Hiii.. try the bellflower sunscreens. Bellflower have both chemical and physical sunscreens. I want to see your review about them 😁; Hi Liah Yoo thank you so much for all your appreciated efforts, I was looking into the dr.g sunscreen on the internet and i saw a-lot of people recommending his &quot;brightening up&quot; sunscreen, have you tried it or at looked into the ingredients list ? If yes please give me your opinion; I found that the purito one pilled a lot on my skin I don’t know if I’m the only one; Hi guys I just bought the colorscience spf 50 face shield. It is tinted  100% mineral (physical) sunscreen and it comes in 3 colours on their website the 1. original 2. glow and 3. bronze. I bought the bronze and its working really well for me. Barely any cast on my skin and I don`t wear any makeup on  top of it.  I would definitely recommend this one for darker skin tones!!. I apply mine with a dry beauty blender (2 layers- allow the 1st layer to dry a bit then apply the 2nd one. I apply 2 layers as in order to get the full effect of spf you are meant to be applying sun screen quite liberally) so that it soaks in without a cast. I would definitely recommend if its within your budget (£24.50 in the UK). For reference I am around  NW45 foundation shade in MAC and estee lauder double wear  I wear  Sandalwood for the foundation shade. I think I am a Fitzpatrick 4/5. I have sensitive dry skin and have experienced no irritation whatsoever with the sun-screen.  I have just bought the colorscience powder version as well so I can use this one to re-apply during the day.; Yes!; thank you for this!; I don’t not usually comment much.. but I want to take my time to say THANK YOU for making a video that takes into account darker skin tones..

I’m in between 🤷🏻‍♀️ But I enjoyed your video and I also love that I have an idea on what to buy!; My problem with mineral spf is the drying effect. It makes my face super dry. I need a moisturising mineral spf; Question. I am working from home at night. I am sleeping at 7am and will wake up at 4pm. I just want to ask, do I need to wear sunscreen before I go to sleep at the morning or do I need to wear it at night when I wake up? I am working in front of a computer with 2 monitors for about 9 to 10 hours. Looking forward for someone to answer my question. Thank you!; This was super helpful!

They just assumed we are the same color tone. Secondly, the makeup counters here in Australia  (melbourne ) are really hard to give samples of the any products. There was one time they even said sorry we don&#39;t give samples to customers.  Ridiculous!   If I need to spend huge amount of money definitely I am allowed to ask for samples.; Thank you !!!

Warm vs Cool Olive Skin - What&#39;s the Difference?,Style Refinement,2023-04-28T18:00:33Z,"Not all olive skin tones are the same - we can be warm OR cool! Let's talk about the differences between warm vs cool olives, ...",yx4-0eI8bn8,"This video is wonderful. How many times have I  been matched with foundations 2-3 tones darker and warmer than I need just because of my olive yellow cast. I think I am a neutral leaning very slightly warm if we consider make up tones. However for lipstick I do better with neutral to cool, and for clothes it’s winter colours while olives, warm reds and orange leaning tans are bad.; why tf did u clap so hard at first 😂 my earsss😂😂😂 but thank you for the contentt, love itt; I am a light olive and my worst colours include: extremely warm, extremely cool, extremely bright, extremely dark (black) and extremely light (white).<br>For years, I was investing time and energy into trying to figure out whether I lean more warm or cool... until I figured and accepted that I am so close to the middle of the warm-cool spectrum that labelling myself as any of the two is pretty irrelevant, and it might confuse me more than help me navigate. Now I know I can pull out any warm or cool shade as long as its temperature is not extreme AND, most importantly of all, it is MUTED.<br>My best shades are those variations of colours that look as if someone took a pinch of a muted olive green and mixed it into that (any) colour: greenish off-white, greenish yellow, greenish + orange, greenish +pink, greenish+blue, greenish + any other colour, you get the thrill. You can train your eye for spotting that &quot;pinch of green&quot; even in red or pink or orange lipstics, as well as in neutrals. And if you, on the top of that, know whether you look better in brights or muted colours, and darker or lighter ones, you have all the keys you need for identifying the right cloths, make up and hair colours. <br>Thanks for the video. Wishing fun to olives &amp;  all ❤; There are also neutral olive skin tones.  🤷‍♀️; Thank you for bringing up Eva! My skin tone is a lighter olive typically though it gets to medium/light range of dark the second I&#39;m in the sun but I have far more yellow and gold tones that show through my skin as well as more red than others with my &quot;range&quot; - finding my season has been difficult but basically, I&#39;m more true neutral with a slight lean towards warm. Deep autumn if I had to pick is just a bit better than cool winter is on me, with black and white and some of the pinks looking awful on me in CW, DA has only one or two no&#39;s. some of the colors that look great on Eva, i can also wear but that bright yellow turns me grey; however, grey tones look equally awful on both her and me. I recently discovered a lime green shade that looks great on me which shocked me bc I loved it as a kid but my mom claimed only very pale people could pull it off so i never even tried it on my body 😅 it was a very nice surprise!; Appreciate all your hard work! 👍🏼🌹; Omg thank you so much for this explanation because all these years I always wonder why I look more grey or sickly in certain photo especially when I&#39;m wearing a clothing that have a grey undertone in it.; I discovered my olive skin tone when I was trying my sister&#39;s skin tint and foundation which leaned towards tye neutral and warm tones. Mine was clearly ashy blueish green compared to my sister; Immediately when I walk into makeup stores, they push Neutral on me. I put it on, go outside and it pulls really pink. I always thought I was more of a golden yellow but very pale… it never sat right but it was the closest. <br><br>THEN I tried cool green from one brand and although it looked a little gray (almost like having no color) it was a perfect match. Sometimes if I get some Sun I pull slightly more yellow than the cool green so I mix in a golden pale color.<br><br>AND THEN I moved away to an area where I got almost no sun exposure (my hometown is by the beach and I’d get a lot of Sun before) and when I moved back home, my feet tanned really quick. I was wearing shorts when I noticed my pale transparent bluish gray green legs (almost like a corpse color) contrasting my golden hued tanned feet. It was hilarious!!! Confirmed I am a cool olive but I do have to mix in a pale yellow to brighten the color to match my brightness. I land on the deep winter (sometimes mistakenly deep autumn) scale. I have a bluish green undertone with a yellow bright overtone and reddish skin sensitivity that gets amplified if I dye my hair orange or red dyes. My hair color is a natural black color. I’m 37 and barely figuring all of this out.<br><br>I say all this because I looked at the cool green foundation and said “no way” but like magic when I put it on it completely blended! I was ecstatic and realized I’m a Martian! 👽 just kidding.; In another video about olive skin, the creator talked about two types: &quot;olive cool and bright&quot; and &quot;olive cool and delicate&quot;. I found this very helpful for me personally. Some with an olive skin tone tolerate bright colors very well (like Eva in your example) and then there are those who need to add a little softness (Gemma Chan looks better with a mauve lipstick than a pink one, for example).; I love this channel 😊; My hair used to be green, ashy! I am an olive, I can still use warm and neutral. Lately, I am looking ashier so maybe not warm?? <br>It’s so confusing 😢; Green skin for the win! Hopefully; What do Greeks have?; Wow! I love that every time I watch one of your videos…. It’s so packed with novel info I know I’ll need to watch it again just to absorb it all. I am a pale skinned olive artist and fashion lover and so the way you break things down has been invaluable to me. ❤️; you have to adjust the white balance, and it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m a photographer; @Jenn. You make a very interesting point saying olives can never be extremely cool or warm for we have both yellow and green. Does this mean that we can only fall in the color seasons closer to neutral like autumn and summer. Because if you mark the 4 color seasons on a spectrum winter and spring are at the far ends.; Because I have a very pale and ruddy skin tone, I&#39;m just recently noticing that I actually have olive undertones and red overtones that hid the olive. I&#39;m clearly cool leaning with my medium ash brown hair and green with a bit of grey eyes and red overtone on my skin. It&#39;s actually so hard to wear full coverage makeup though, because things that match my neutral undertone cover the red overtone and things that are cool look pink as fuck on me because my undertone is olive, so I&#39;m like a creamy off white under the freckles and &quot;tan&quot;. (My tan is just red. I look permanently sunburned if I get sun, so I avoid it.) The combination of tones in my skin make me look a little peach or grey circumstantially, which made it confusing for me to figure out that I&#39;m cool toned because it initially seemed like maybe cool tones wash me out.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve realized that I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m a cool summer out of all the seasonal palettes, so it seems like I should be very cool if that defines my best palette, but actually I just seem like someone who needs very medium everything and I lean more cool than warm. Like, I look bad in many pastels AND overly dark colors. I look good in pure grey that&#39;s more medium in value, like Rihanna&#39;s fur in the video where she&#39;s compared to Eva Mendes, but bad in a lot of soft colors. I&#39;m bright for a summer, but not bright or deep enough to really be a winter. I can find colors to borrow outside of my season more easily than from other palettes in my season. The soft and light spring palettes lack the clarity and depth I need with my medium hair and eyes contrasting so much with my pale skin. The colors I wear just need to be more neutral rather than overly warm, medium depth, and medium clarity.; I have similar coloring to you, although I am a lot older than you are.  Thanks for your great explanation of olives.  It really helped.; I’m a light cool olive. We can appear warm but then put true warm tones and we look sickly lol; Pale olive with greyish cast. <br>I look horrible in grey and pale colors in general. I look best in jewel tones.; It&#39;s taken me a virtual lifetime to finally understand that I have a neutral olive skintone that appears cooler during winter, but a cool rose-gold brown if I get a tan. More vibrant or saturated look best on me. Shades like: magenta, teal, turquoise , lime green and chartreuse, plum, red, emerald green, royal purple, even black. But. NO baby blue, light pink or most yellows, and other than a deep, warm charcoal, gray makes me look like a cadaver!; Does this mean that if you have olive skin, then technically you can&#39;t be one of the 4 &quot;true&quot; seasons since the mix of yellow and blue means the coolness/warmness of the color doesn&#39;t matter as much?; I’ve been loving your olive skin tone series. Explains so much about my struggle to find my personal color.; Will you please do a video dedicated to helping fair olives find their colors &amp; makeup? For reference, I’ve learned that I’m fair olives leaning cool and it’s been very difficult for me to understand how to choose clothing colors and it’s nearly impossible to find fair cool olive’s makeup: foundation, concealer, blush, etc. <br>💡 Maybe a video helping us on each side, fair cool olive and one for fair warm olive.👍🏻😊; Can’t you say that olives are neutral?; thank you  I am a fair warm olive, with green yellow hazel eyes!  this was very helpful!!; Very helpful!; Thank you!<br>Can you do an exact analysis to olive vip personalties please? Like for nina dobrev?; Extremely helpful video for me as olive skinned person, thanks for taking the time to make it; You are a scientist of colors 😅 very informative video 👌; TEAM MEDIUM-SKIN!; Came here from your video how to figure out you&#39;re olive and seeing an example of grey-ness in cool olives has me convinced I&#39;m not. I&#39;m mixed eastern chinese, so I do look a bit more yellow than saxon-anglo people, but apparently that doesn&#39;t mean I have to be olive. Thanks! This is all very informative<br><br>Edit: after some experimenting, I&#39;m correcting myself. I&#39;m cool, light olive, but not very obviously, so just on the edge of olive territory. There are some specific colours that set off my &quot;green-ness&quot; but looks like I need to push pretty far.; I love the spectrum concept. It makes all of this so much easier to understand; Omg thank you for this video!!! You&#39;re literally first &quot;color consultant&quot; that actually makes sense to me, talks to the depth and don&#39;t put everyone into certain &quot;boxes&quot; or seasons... I&#39;ve been racking my brain for the last few months about which season I belong to, only to realize that I have olive skin and it&#39;s just not that simple 😅 (it&#39;s very RELATIVE as you said). One thing that doesn&#39;t make sense to me in color theory is claim that everyone belongs constantly into one season. When summer arrives I can get so tanned and turn literally orange :D!!! I don&#39;t think it looks very good but at least I look radiant in orange/brick/brown/bronze/golden lipsticks and makeup. And then winter comes and I&#39;m stunned every year that same lipsticks I wore in summer are simply overpowering and neutral shades are absolutely the best choice (soft autumn colors are closes to what I&#39;m talking about). The same goes with eyeshadows, best combo is when I mix cool with warm shades, but warm shades alone do always look better than cool shades alone, that&#39;s why it&#39;s obvious I lean more into warm side. I hope you and some other people with olive skin can agree on this with me, that summer and winter season literally change our color season and suitable colors for us... Btw the second I turned this video I was thinking that this girl MUST have olive skin, so my assumptions can&#39;t be that wrong 😁; Am I even olive? I&#39;m the winter I&#39;m medium tan pink undertone. And I&#39;m the summer I get a deeper shade with yellow undertones.. So less blue instead of more??; Thanks for your olive videos! They are so helpful. For my fellow olives, I finally found my perfect foundation match after hearing the advice to add in green color corrector. I get CG N2 foundation, mix in a few drops of green and it matches perfectly.; That’s so interesting. I was typed as a True autumn. But I always have problems with make up and finding the right shape. I have grey in my skin and a warm shades especially to warm look awfully off on me. I usually don’t wear make up because it looks always to warm. I have a similar hue to Rihanna and Beyoncé. Would you say that Beyoncé has also an olive skin? that is soooo interesting I was thinking that Iam very warm skin toned but couldn’t understand why I look grey in many pictures. I have to say I look more horrible in a bright yellow than in a blue. I will now explore more neutral skin shades of make up. Thanks again for your service; Thank you, I thought as I am very pale i can&#39;t be olive, but I think it&#39;s possible i am, my foundation and make up is warm except lipstick but more deep colors not pale, but I am better with cool colors clothing, fascinating; Zoe Saldana is black and not olive AT ALL. She is considered a deep level 4-5 skin level. Rianna is lighter but not an olive either. If anything she is a dark level 4 skin tone. Neither are considered olives. Olives are Selma Hayek hue and lighter due to the lightness and HUE.  By a rule Olives are not that dark. Ri maybe be a warn tone nuetral or cool but never an olive nor what is considered fair.; Thank you so much for explaining this! I’d always assumed I was warm because I’m light olive, but most olive foundations still pull super orange on me. I’m hopefully a more gray-toned products will match me better.; Great videos. Love the in-depth detailsand visuals 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽; So what I&#39;ve figured out is, I am extremely pale olive, more yellow in the summer months and more gray in the winter. Using dark blue as a tester (because I like to make things hard), I chose marine, sapphire and navy. Sapphire is my best, followed by marine (it&#39;s okay), with navy being awful. Conversely, I look amazing in garnet, but horrible in fuchsia and tomato. Chocolate is my friend but khaki is my enemy; true black looks striking but any gray feels like casket shopping. I take this to mean that on me, clarity may be a more important factor than temperature or value. Does anyone out there know if I&#39;m on the right track? I&#39;m totally confused on pale colors. Any help would be appreciated.; Grah i still cant tell if im neutral olive or warm. Or neutral leaning warm. Or if im still warm but currently muted from it being winter.  The moment i spend time in the summer my olive complexion is undeniably warm. Everything currently pulls either too cool or too warm on me especially with makeup. Normally i would naturally gravitate to warm tones but lately ive been questioning how everything looks on me. Someone recommended trying out muted warm pinks/peach blushes which looks much more harmoniums on my complextion. i dont think im a cool olive since i think barbie pinks, purples, baby blues, and liacs (unless its a rich deep plum purple/amethyst and muted slate blue) tend to look atrocious on me. Grah this coloring is confusing. I think im a muted autumn or true autumn but most jewel tones look great on my complexion as well. And muted versions of most.ofnthe jewel tones look great too.; Can you put this in your personal colours and skintone series playlist? I think this video got missed and it&#39;s such a good one!; One of the rare videos that finally helped me.; Wow we share the exakt same problem regarding finding a foundation that matches our skin tone! I look warm in peoples eyes, but everytime I try out makeup for warm skin tones, I always ending up looking so much darker with a completely different skin color (mostly a weird looking orange!) But neutral colors have always looked sooo much better on me! wich may seem a bit suprising for some xD; You have the best explanation regarding this topic !!!; Thank you for the great video!❤❤❤; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx4-0eI8bn8&amp;t=510"">8:30</a> this is so true, I’ve bought so many concealers  trying to find the right shade. It took me over 4 years bc I didn’t want to be wasteful. I kept noticing that any shade that claimed to be warm looked too orange on my skin, I knew I wasn’t cool toned bc I was too yellow (I’m almost pale so it’s easier to tell), so I gave neutral shades a chance and the shade match is almost perfect now; Thanks for explaining this. I have been trying to figure out my colors. I know I am a cool olive, but as I have been trying different winter colors - I have been getting more confused. I recently settled on the idea that the brightness of a color is more important for me then the actual temperature and I couldn&#39;t figure out why, some of the softer/medium winter colors just didn&#39;t seem to do a lot for me the way a bright color does.; I hate being an olive. No brand in my country makes my shade I have 0 foundation/concealer its just sad; My favorite foundations these days are the Pat McGrath foundation foundations in the shades Medium 18, Medium 21 and Medium Dark 23 because they all have olive undertones and they look really good on me<br><br>I also love wearing the Danessa Myricks Beauty Vision Cream Cover foundations in N07 and in TO01 Olive became they also appear to have olive undertones in them; I’m very much a yellow olive - a warm olive; I am bright, light, olive, and confused<br><br>So if don’t have grayness in my skin am I automatically warm olive ? It’s hard to tell because I am pretty pale; Quick question, cause i am confused 😅, muted colours suit better muted/ not clear skintones, or the opposite?; This is a great video. I also think you can see in the Eva photos how her varying hair color has an impact as well in terms of what color looks good on her.; Yes i always see a lot of yellow in <a href=""http://my.skin/"">my.skin</a>, but warm foundations look too orangey on my skin.; This make sense because I always choose neutral foundation but would see a green tint in my skin. Now I realize it&#39;s my lack of red, but my tan/tan deep skin adds another layer of confusion. 🫒 😵‍💫 p.s. You are a godsend. I was ecstatic when I saw that you offer analysis/consulting. Planning on getting the Total Package...hoping my life as a beauty rubik&#39;s cube will end. 😅; my problem with makeup, being a very light olive, is that there&#39;s usually no undertone selection in my shade. i&#39;m lucky if anything is light enough drugstore wise. i think the makeup trick is probably best for people with mid tone skin, since we all know people with very deep skin have even more trouble finding foundation than i do; You explained this SO WELL! I often wondered why I was a &quot;cool toned&quot; girly but I looked so good in certain vibrant warm colors and so bad that are recommended on &quot;cool toned girls&quot;. Definitely related a lot to Eva Mendez in the respect that I feel like beige-gray colors make me look so sickly. &lt;3 Thank you!; now I hear you saying you are a warm olive lol; you are a cool olive dear; you look like a flamboyant gamine; Great explanation!👍 Definitely struggle w/finding foundations: even olive-based foundations, when they’re available are often TOO olive, but foundations that lean yellow or peach are often too far those directions, and neutral foundations often just make me look ashy or even worse, dead! My skin tone is a medium olive/neutral, leaning slightly golden (tan well…but sometimes in a combination of golden, neutral tan &amp;/or ruddy). Sometimes I can find a foundation in my general range, but it’s challenging for sure! Certain brands bring more success than others.🤷; this made me realize i have a cool olive skin tone omg thank you; Lol this was helpful. I think I’m a pretty similar complexion shade to Zoe and it’s been a struggle trying to categorize myself bc at times i can really see the yellow warmth in my skin but it’s weird bc there’s also like..a grey/pale cast to it that gives it a grey look, especially in the lighting out at stores and stuff. Lol so I’m always confused but I feel like this has helped me make sense of WHY I was so confused lol; I&#39;m not able to understand if either I&#39;m really pale olive or I look really sick(; Yessss I only get “super warm” during the summer but I’m still olive. Ppl always say I’m warm all year round, but then I always look too orange; Hi be good to suggest that some races do have white undertones others yellow  as well as red pink undertones over white skin and other  green etc; My first time at m.a.c and she gave me that very warm foundation. I liked like I had yellow fever. 😂 Cool colors are too red-ish. Neutral works the best. However, I tried the warm olive from Fenty beauty, and I looked like Fiona. 😂; This was so helpful because I look grey as hell. Especially in winter, I look like I&#39;ve just risen from the dead and tend to get comments (mostly from my mom) about looking sick and &quot;like I&#39;ve been trapped in a basement my whole life&quot;. I don&#39;t like the feeling of makeup (foundation) on my skin, but I look like I should be playing in The Walking Dead without it. During the summer my skin shapeshifts and becomes this unhealthy green colour and since I am also extremely pale, the effect of looking like I&#39;m on the brink of death gets maximalized. I was never able to find any colours that looked good on me, but this video made me scroll through some old photos and I found a picture of me in a true red dress, which surprisingly made my skin look less sickly. I guess clarity really is important for people with cool olive skin. This topic should be talked about more often. Great video!<br><br>Edit: One thing I noticed is that even though clear/bold colours look good on me when it comes to clothing, those same colours look absolutely horrible directly on my face in the form of lipstick. Ever since I switched to lip tint and simple lip oil, my complexion has been looking so much better. Not saying this will be true for everyone, but it might be worth a try.; I thought I was neutral but I’m not sure. I’m 1/4 Lebanese and the rest is Scottish descent. I tan very easily and don’t really burn unless I’m careless, but my default is kinda pale. I wish there was someone who can look at me and just tell me what will work- I’m 45 and still have no damn idea; I loved to learn how olive skin can also have some neutral in it as sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m not neutral instead. But then, I remember how I once brought two foundations that looked almost the same, even if one was a sample of a cool one, and the other was a full-size neutral. Surprisingly, the neutral one gave me a very grayish look if I tried to wear it on my whole face while the cool foundation left a more natural finish unlike what I expected seeing the pictures of it online 😅 (I was so shocked with the neutral that I even tried it in my brother thinking something was wrong with it, just to find out it was his shade and that my brother has neutral skin color 🤣); This is the most detailed guide I&#39;ve seen to explain olive skin. Consider this my reminder that I&#39;m probably a cool-olive, and why I look so &quot;sickly&quot; compared to other people.; Thanks your videos are so helpful you explain very well !  <br><br>Would love a video about hair color and seasonal palette and for olive skins 😊; This is hands down THE BEST explanation of this I’ve ever seen - Thank you!!!; Thank you for using examples with brown skin. Was really helpful!; I think I&#39;m a light warm olive with rosacia and hyperpigmentation around the eyes. No wonder I&#39;ve never been able to find a foundation or even worse a concealer that works for me. Nowadays i just forgo foundation and concealers, since they somehow all seem to emphasise the bad stuff over the good stuff; Your video is the most detail and easiest to understand how to determine my skin undertone. Thanks; So how would you find what seasonal color palette would look good on olive skin? (Watched all the prior videos too...just struggling with this!); I&#39;ve been watching your personal color series and girl do I finally get the explanation as to why I find color season so confusing. All this time by elimination I thought I should be somewhere in the Autumn spectrum but I cannot pull off anything too warm nor can I wear anything to bright. Yet not all muted colors look good on me. It&#39;s super confusing. Now I know why. I have olive skin, and it&#39;s so true that I can wear more colors when I&#39;m tanned. I&#39;m still not sure whether I&#39;m leaning towards warm/cool, I guess I&#39;m in the &quot;neutral&quot; zone. Would love to see more olive skin content and how to find our best color. &lt;3; I just got in the smashbox olive foundation in their fairest olive shade. And it was a smidge too yellow. I ordered in some blue color corrector. I think I am super close to getting my perfect shade! But it makes me wonder if I am a cool tone olive or more of a neutral olive? I guess my skin does have some grey tones, but it wasn&#39;t until I tried on that foundation that I realized it. <br><br>I also have a tip. I use a neutral pale concealer (since it gives me a bit of peachiness to my skin) on top of my foundation/on the highlights of my face, along with a pale pink blush to give my face a bit of pink/some flush to it. Because my face just has little to no pink in it otherwise whether I have foundation on or not. It just adds more dimension, I think.; The same thing happens to me with sales people in beauty stores. I have medium-light brown hair, brown eyes, medium-light toned skin (maybe a bit Italian-in-Winter looking?) but they assume I am warm- toned. Then they are surprised when the concealers look too orange. Lol Usually light to medium concealers work best. Also re: Colors, I look best in muted colors overall. (Mustard rather than lemon yellow, cranberry vs tomato, etc.; I love how thorough you are. Hands down the best videos. <br>You are great at facial proportions, would you be able to create a consultation that can help on what procedures we can do to make for a more symmetrical or appealing face?; Thank you so much for this! Ive been pulling my hair out over figuring out my gf&#39;s mixed skin. So much makes sense now! And explains why her grey/green tshirt looks 🤮 on her but why she can wear both warm &amp; cool tones!; man this is complicated 😂 but you explained it well! i have olive skin and didn’t know there was a spectrum within it until today. i was testing foundations at sephora and was confused when the neutrals looked too warm, and ended up matching a cool shade. they sadly didn’t have a cool olive but it’s good to know that’s what i need!; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx4-0eI8bn8&amp;t=414"">6:54</a> why is blue responsible for darker colors <br>usually you say black comes into them additionally!?!<br>if its blue then the are automatically cooler!?; Hi Jen, thank you for the informative video! Could you share your opinion on which seasons olives tend to fall under?; I&#39;m an oger; As a dark cool olive toned woman, you are THEE official spokes person for olive skin tones!. BRILLIANT explanation!. Thank you for including and diving into details about all of us I even found sound advice and tips for mine specifically.; When I go on vacation and fail to apply adequate sunscreen, my skin looks more gray. It doesnt turn red like common online guides say/expect; On behalf of all fellow Asians, (PLEASE I BEG U) do one just for the Asian girlies. We have so much variety within our continent (im southeast Asian) and don’t have much examples to go off because we’re not black, white or Hispanic 😭😭😭 me a 30 year old still confused if I am warm or cool olive…or just Asian…; It’s so hard to find complexion products for dark skin with an olive undertones.  It’s drives me insane having to correct the undertones of my foundation.; I look better in dark cool colors and warm medium colors which is very confusing.; This dress is perfect for your olive skin! I need muddy colors because I’m so muted. I still can’t figure out if I’m neutral or olive. Next to someone that is cool I look green but next to true neutral I look warm!; I&#39;m blue but I identify as a spicy olive 😅; Hey , kindly do anya taylor hill color analysis, she seems to break all the rules, she rocks blonde , warm, dark hair, wear every color it’s confusing, i think it will make a nice and different video, thanks; Wow. I actually might be olive. Me and Rihanna are the same skin tone. I never understood what olive skin tone was but the way you described it bought clarity for me. I’ve always thought I was golden but wearing such yellow/orange foundations was never right for me. neutral foundations that still have that yellow tint works best for me. It also makes me wonder what seasonal palette I am now. I still don’t prefer such bright colors on me but I may have to experiment and see; Make up colours are so complicated.<br>I used to like ones with a rose tone because I thought it cancelled out the green.  Pink and green are complementary, so that makes sense.<br>Then it&#39;s cool so that is what I thought I was for many years.<br>Now I think I have some warm too though.  <br>I would like to know more about colour corrector.<br>Thanks.  Very good video.  Some things can&#39;t be simplified."
